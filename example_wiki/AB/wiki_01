{"id": "11168", "revid": "122189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11168", "title": "Fortran", "text": "Fortran (; formerly FORTRAN) is a third-generation, compiled, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.\nFortran was originally developed by IBM. It first compiled correctly in 1958. Fortran computer programs have been written to support scientific and engineering applications, such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, plasma physics, geophysics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.\nFortran has evolved through numerous versions and dialects. In 1966, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed a standard for Fortran to limit proliferation of compilers using slightly different syntax. Successive versions have added support for a character data type (Fortran 77), structured programming, array programming, modular programming, generic programming (Fortran 90), parallel computing (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming (Fortran 2003), and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).\nSince April 2024, Fortran has ranked among the top ten languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.\nNaming.\nThe first manual for FORTRAN describes it as a \"Formula Translating System\", and printed the name with small caps, . Other sources suggest the name stands for \"Formula Translator\", or \"Formula Translation\".\nEarly IBM computers did not support lowercase letters, and the names of versions of the language through FORTRAN\u00a077 were usually spelled in all-uppercase. FORTRAN\u00a077 was the last version in which the Fortran character set included only uppercase letters.\nThe official language standards for Fortran have referred to the language as \"Fortran\" with initial caps since Fortran 90.\nOrigins.\nIn late 1953, John W. Backus submitted a proposal to his superiors at IBM to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for programming their IBM 704 mainframe computer. Backus' historic FORTRAN team consisted of programmers Richard Goldberg, Sheldon F. Best, Harlan Herrick, Peter Sheridan, Roy Nutt, Robert Nelson, Irving Ziller, Harold Stern, Lois Haibt, and David Sayre. Its concepts included easier entry of equations into a computer, an idea developed by J. Halcombe Laning and demonstrated in the Laning and Zierler system of 1952.\nA draft specification for \"The IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System\" was completed by November 1954. The first manual for FORTRAN appeared in October 1956, with the first FORTRAN compiler delivered in April 1957. Fortran produced efficient enough code for assembly language programmers to accept a high-level programming language replacement.\nJohn Backus said during a 1979 interview with \"Think\", the IBM employee magazine, \"Much of my work has come from being lazy. I didn't like writing programs, and so, when I was working on the IBM 701, writing programs for computing missile trajectories, I started work on a programming system to make it easier to write programs.\"\nThe language was widely adopted by scientists for writing numerically intensive programs, which encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that could generate faster and more efficient code. The inclusion of a complex number data type in the language made Fortran especially suited to technical applications such as electrical engineering.\nBy 1960, versions of FORTRAN were available for the IBM 709, 650, 1620, and 7090 computers. Significantly, the increasing popularity of FORTRAN spurred competing computer manufacturers to provide FORTRAN compilers for their machines, so that by 1963 over 40 FORTRAN compilers existed.\nFORTRAN was provided for the IBM 1401 computer by an innovative 63-phase compiler that ran entirely in its core memory of only 8000 (six-bit) characters. The compiler could be run from tape, or from a 2200-card deck; it used no further tape or disk storage. It kept the program in memory and loaded overlays that gradually transformed it, in place, into executable form, as described by Haines.\nThis article was reprinted, edited, in both editions of \"Anatomy of a Compiler\" and in the IBM manual \"Fortran Specifications and Operating Procedures, IBM 1401\". The executable form was not entirely machine language; rather, floating-point arithmetic, sub-scripting, input/output, and function references were interpreted, preceding UCSD Pascal P-code by two decades. GOTRAN, a simplified, interpreted version of FORTRAN I (with only 12 types of statements not 32) for \"load and go\" operation was available (at least for the early IBM 1620 computer). Modern Fortran, and almost all later versions, are fully compiled, as done for other high-performance languages.\nThe development of Fortran paralleled the early evolution of compiler technology, and many advances in the theory and design of compilers were specifically motivated by the need to generate efficient code for Fortran programs.\nFORTRAN.\nThe initial release of FORTRAN for the IBM 704 contained 32 types of statements, including:\nThe arithmetic statement was reminiscent of (but not readily implementable by) a three-way comparison instruction (CAS\u2014Compare Accumulator with Storage) available on the 704. The statement provided the only way to compare numbers\u2014by testing their difference, with an attendant risk of overflow. This deficiency was later overcome by \"logical\" facilities introduced in FORTRAN IV.\nThe statement was used originally (and optionally) to give branch probabilities for the three branch cases of the arithmetic statement. It could also be used to suggest how many iterations a loop might run. The first FORTRAN compiler used this weighting to perform \"at compile time\" a Monte Carlo simulation of the generated code, the results of which were used to optimize the placement of basic blocks in memory\u2014a very sophisticated optimization for its time. The Monte Carlo technique is documented in Backus et al.'s paper on this original implementation, \"The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System\":\nThe fundamental unit of program is the basic block; a basic block is a stretch of program which has one entry point and one exit point. The purpose of section 4 is to prepare for section 5 a table of predecessors (PRED table) which enumerates the basic blocks and lists for every basic block each of the basic blocks which can be its immediate predecessor in flow, together with the absolute frequency of each such basic block link. This table is obtained by running the program once in Monte-Carlo fashion, in which the outcome of conditional transfers arising out of IF-type statements and computed GO TO's is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted according to whatever FREQUENCY statements have been provided.\nThe first FORTRAN compiler reported diagnostic information by halting the program when an error was found and outputting an error code on its console. That code could be looked up by the programmer in an error messages table in the operator's manual, providing them with a brief description of the problem. Later, an error-handling subroutine to handle user errors such as division by zero, developed by NASA, was incorporated, informing users of which line of code contained the error.\nFixed layout and punched cards.\nBefore the development of disk files, text editors and terminals, programs were most often entered on a keypunch keyboard onto 80-column punched cards, one line to a card. The resulting deck of cards would be fed into a card reader to be compiled. Punched card codes included no lower-case letters or many special characters, and special versions of the IBM 026 keypunch were offered that would correctly print the re-purposed special characters used in FORTRAN.\nReflecting punched card input practice, Fortran programs were originally written in a fixed-column format, with the first 72 columns read into twelve 36-bit words.\nA letter \"C\" in column 1 caused the entire card to be treated as a comment and ignored by the compiler. Otherwise, the columns of the card were divided into four fields:\nColumns 73 to 80 could therefore be used for identification information, such as punching a sequence number or text, which could be used to re-order cards if a stack of cards was dropped; though in practice this was reserved for stable, production programs. An IBM 519 could be used to copy a program deck and add sequence numbers. Some early compilers, e.g., the IBM 650's, had additional restrictions due to limitations on their card readers. Keypunches could be programmed to tab to column 7 and skip out after column 72. Later compilers relaxed most fixed-format restrictions, and the requirement was eliminated in the Fortran 90 standard.\nWithin the statement field, whitespace characters (blanks) were ignored outside a text literal. This allowed omitting spaces between tokens for brevity or including spaces within identifiers for clarity. For example, was a valid identifier, equivalent to , and 101010DO101I=1,101 was a valid statement, equivalent to 10101 DO 101 I = 1, 101 because the zero in column 6 is treated as if it were a space (!), while 101010DO101I=1.101 was instead 10101 DO101I = 1.101, the assignment of 1.101 to a variable called DO101I. Note the slight visual difference between a comma and a period.\nHollerith strings, originally allowed only in FORMAT and DATA statements, were prefixed by a character count and the letter H (e.g., ), allowing blanks to be retained within the character string. Miscounts were a problem.\nEvolution.\nFORTRAN II.\nIBM's \"FORTRAN II\" appeared in 1958. The main enhancement was to support procedural programming by allowing user-written subroutines and functions which returned values with parameters passed by reference. The COMMON statement provided a way for subroutines to access common (or global) variables. Six new statements were introduced:\nOver the next few years, FORTRAN II added support for the and data types.\nEarly FORTRAN compilers supported no recursion in subroutines. Early computer architectures supported no concept of a stack, and when they did directly support subroutine calls, the return location was often stored in one fixed location adjacent to the subroutine code (e.g. the IBM 1130) or a specific machine register (IBM 360 \"et seq\"), which only allows recursion if a stack is maintained by software and the return address is stored on the stack before the call is made and restored after the call returns. Although not specified in FORTRAN 77, many F77 compilers supported recursion as an option, and the Burroughs mainframes, designed with recursion built-in, did so by default. It became a standard in Fortran 90 via the new keyword RECURSIVE.\nSimple FORTRAN II program.\nThis program, for Heron's formula, reads data on a tape reel containing three 5-digit integers A, B, and C as input. There are no \"type\" declarations available: variables whose name starts with I, J, K, L, M, or N are \"fixed-point\" (i.e. integers), otherwise floating-point. Since integers are to be processed in this example, the names of the variables start with the letter \"I\". The name of a variable must start with a letter and can continue with both letters and digits, up to a limit of six characters in FORTRAN II. If A, B, and C cannot represent the sides of a triangle in plane geometry, then the program's execution will end with an error code of \"STOP 1\". Otherwise, an output line will be printed showing the input values for A, B, and C, followed by the computed AREA of the triangle as a floating-point number occupying ten spaces along the line of output and showing 2 digits after the decimal point, the .2 in F10.2 of the FORMAT statement with label 601.\nC AREA OF A TRIANGLE WITH A STANDARD SQUARE ROOT FUNCTION\nC INPUT - TAPE READER UNIT 5, INTEGER INPUT\nC OUTPUT - LINE PRINTER UNIT 6, REAL OUTPUT\nC INPUT ERROR DISPLAY ERROR OUTPUT CODE 1 IN JOB CONTROL LISTING\n READ INPUT TAPE 5, 501, IA, IB, IC\n 501 FORMAT (3I5)\nC IA, IB, AND IC MAY NOT BE NEGATIVE OR ZERO\nC FURTHERMORE, THE SUM OF TWO SIDES OF A TRIANGLE\nC MUST BE GREATER THAN THE THIRD SIDE, SO WE CHECK FOR THAT, TOO\n IF (IA) 777, 777, 701\n 701 IF (IB) 777, 777, 702\n 702 IF (IC) 777, 777, 703\n 703 IF (IA+IB-IC) 777, 777, 704\n 704 IF (IA+IC-IB) 777, 777, 705\n 705 IF (IB+IC-IA) 777, 777, 799\n 777 STOP 1\nC USING HERON'S FORMULA WE CALCULATE THE\nC AREA OF THE TRIANGLE\n 799 S = FLOATF (IA + IB + IC) / 2.0\n AREA = SQRTF( S * (S - FLOATF(IA)) * (S - FLOATF(IB)) *\n + (S - FLOATF(IC)))\n WRITE OUTPUT TAPE 6, 601, IA, IB, IC, AREA\n 601 FORMAT (4H A= ,I5,5H B= ,I5,5H C= ,I5,8H AREA= ,F10.2,\n + 13H SQUARE UNITS)\n STOP\n END\nFORTRAN III.\nIBM also developed a \"FORTRAN III\" in 1958 that allowed for inline assembly code among other features; however, this version was never released as a product. Like the 704 FORTRAN and FORTRAN II, FORTRAN III included machine-dependent features that made code written in it unportable from machine to machine, as well as Boolean expression support. Early versions of FORTRAN provided by other vendors suffered from the same disadvantage.\nFORTRAN IV.\nIBM began development of FORTRAN IV in 1961 as a result of customer demands. FORTRAN IV removed the machine-dependent features of FORTRAN II (such as ), while adding new features such as a data type, logical Boolean expressions, and the \"logical IF statement\" as an alternative to the \"arithmetic IF statement.\" FORTRAN IV was eventually released in 1962, first for the IBM 7030 (\"Stretch\") computer, followed by versions for the IBM 7090, IBM 7094, and later for the IBM 1401 in 1966.\nBy 1965, FORTRAN IV was supposed to be compliant with the \"standard\" being developed by the American Standards Association X3.4.3 FORTRAN Working Group.\nBetween 1966 and 1968, IBM offered several FORTRAN IV compilers for its System/360, each named by letters that indicated the minimum amount of memory the compiler needed to run.\nThe letters (F, G, H) matched the codes used with System/360 model numbers to indicate memory size, each letter increment being a factor of two larger:\nDigital Equipment Corporation maintained DECSYSTEM-10 Fortran IV (F40) for PDP-10 from 1967 to 1975. Compilers were also available for the UNIVAC 1100 series and the Control Data 6000 series and 7000 series systems.\nAt about this time FORTRAN IV had started to become an important educational tool and implementations such as the University of Waterloo's WATFOR and WATFIV were created to simplify the complex compile and link processes of earlier compilers.\nIn the FORTRAN IV programming environment of the era, except for that used on Control Data Corporation (CDC) systems, only one instruction was placed per line. The CDC version allowed for multiple instructions per line if separated by a (dollar) character. The FORTRAN sheet was divided into four fields, as described above.\nTwo compilers of the time, IBM \"G\" and UNIVAC, allowed comments to be written on the same line as instructions, separated by a special character: \"master space\": V (perforations 7 and 8) for UNIVAC and perforations 12/11/0/7/8/9 (hexadecimal FF) for IBM. These comments were not to be inserted in the middle of continuation cards.\nFORTRAN 66.\nPerhaps the most significant development in the early history of FORTRAN was the decision by the \"American Standards Association\" (now American National Standards Institute (ANSI)) to form a committee sponsored by the Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (BEMA) to develop an \"American Standard Fortran\". The resulting two standards, approved in March 1966, defined two languages, \"FORTRAN\" (based on FORTRAN IV, which had served as a de facto standard), and \"Basic FORTRAN\" (based on FORTRAN II, but stripped of its machine-dependent features). The FORTRAN defined by the first standard, officially denoted X3.9-1966, became known as \"FORTRAN 66\" (although many continued to term it FORTRAN IV, the language on which the standard was largely based). FORTRAN 66 effectively became the first industry-standard version of FORTRAN. FORTRAN 66 included:\nThe above Fortran II version of the Heron program needs several modifications to compile as a Fortran 66 program. Modifications include using the more machine independent versions of the and statements, and removal of the unneeded type conversion functions. Though not required, the arithmetic statements can be re-written to use logical statements and expressions in a more structured fashion.\nC AREA OF A TRIANGLE WITH A STANDARD SQUARE ROOT FUNCTION\nC INPUT - TAPE READER UNIT 5, INTEGER INPUT\nC OUTPUT - LINE PRINTER UNIT 6, REAL OUTPUT\nC INPUT ERROR DISPLAY ERROR OUTPUT CODE 1 IN JOB CONTROL LISTING\n READ (5, 501) IA, IB, IC\n 501 FORMAT (3I5)\nC\nC IA, IB, AND IC MAY NOT BE NEGATIVE OR ZERO\nC FURTHERMORE, THE SUM OF TWO SIDES OF A TRIANGLE\nC MUST BE GREATER THAN THE THIRD SIDE, SO WE CHECK FOR THAT, TOO\n IF (IA .GT. 0 .AND.

Final drafts of this revised standard circulated in 1977, leading to formal approval of the new FORTRAN standard in April 1978. The new standard, called \"FORTRAN 77\" and officially denoted X3.9-1978, added a number of significant features to address many of the shortcomings of FORTRAN 66:\nIn this revision of the standard, a number of features were removed or altered in a manner that might invalidate formerly standard-conforming programs.\nWhile most of the 24 items in the conflict list (see Appendix A2 of X3.9-1978) addressed loopholes or pathological cases permitted by the prior standard but rarely used, a small number of specific capabilities were deliberately removed, such as:\n DIMENSION A(10,5)\n Y = A(11,1)\nA Fortran 77 version of the Heron program requires no modifications to the Fortran 66 version. However this example demonstrates additional cleanup of the I/O statements, including using list-directed I/O, and replacing the Hollerith edit descriptors in the statements with quoted strings.

In the meantime, as the \"Standard FORTRAN\" for nearly fifteen years, FORTRAN 77 would become the historically most important dialect.\nAn important practical extension to FORTRAN 77 was the release of MIL-STD-1753 in 1978. This specification, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, standardized a number of features implemented by most FORTRAN 77 compilers but not included in the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard. These features would eventually be incorporated into the Fortran 90 standard.\nThe IEEE 1003.9 POSIX Standard, released in 1991, provided a simple means for FORTRAN 77 programmers to issue POSIX system calls. Over 100 calls were defined in the document allowing access to POSIX-compatible process control, signal handling, file system control, device control, procedure pointing, and stream I/O in a portable manner.\nFortran 90.\nThe much-delayed successor to FORTRAN 77, informally known as \"Fortran 90\" (and prior to that, \"Fortran 8X\"), was finally released as ISO/IEC standard 1539:1991 in 1991 and an ANSI Standard in 1992. In addition to changing the official spelling from FORTRAN to Fortran, this major revision added many new features to reflect the significant changes in programming practice that had evolved since the 1978 standard:\nObsolescence and deletions.\nUnlike the prior revision, Fortran 90 removed no features. Any standard-conforming FORTRAN 77 program was also standard-conforming under Fortran 90, and either standard should have been usable to define its behavior.\nA small set of features were identified as \"obsolescent\" and were expected to be removed in a future standard. All of the functionalities of these early-version features can be performed by newer Fortran features. Some are kept to simplify porting of old programs but many were deleted in Fortran 95.\n\"Hello, World!\" example.\nprogram helloworld\n print *, \"Hello, World!\"\nend program helloworld\nFortran 95.\n\"Fortran 95\", published officially as ISO/IEC 1539-1:1997, was a minor revision, mostly to resolve some outstanding issues from the Fortran 90 standard. Nevertheless, Fortran 95 also added a number of extensions, notably from the High Performance Fortran specification:\nA number of intrinsic functions were extended (for example a argument was added to the intrinsic).\nSeveral features noted in Fortran 90 to be \"obsolescent\" were removed from Fortran 95:\nAn important supplement to Fortran 95 was the ISO technical report \"TR-15581: Enhanced Data Type Facilities\", informally known as the \"Allocatable TR.\" This specification defined enhanced use of arrays, prior to the availability of fully Fortran 2003-compliant Fortran compilers. Such uses include arrays as derived type components, in procedure dummy argument lists, and as function return values. ( arrays are preferable to -based arrays because arrays are guaranteed by Fortran 95 to be deallocated automatically when they go out of scope, eliminating the possibility of memory leakage. In addition, elements of allocatable arrays are contiguous, and aliasing is not an issue for optimization of array references, allowing compilers to generate faster code than in the case of pointers.)\nAnother important supplement to Fortran 95 was the ISO technical report \"TR-15580: Floating-point exception handling\", informally known as the \"IEEE TR.\" This specification defined support for IEEE floating-point arithmetic and floating-point exception handling.\nConditional compilation and varying length strings.\nIn addition to the mandatory \"Base language\" (defined in ISO/IEC 1539-1 : 1997), the Fortran 95 language also included two optional modules:\nwhich, together, compose the multi-part International Standard (ISO/IEC 1539).\nAccording to the standards developers, \"the optional parts describe self-contained features which have been requested by a substantial body of users and/or implementors, but which are not deemed to be of sufficient generality for them to be required in all standard-conforming Fortran compilers.\" Nevertheless, if a standard-conforming Fortran does provide such options, then they \"must be provided in accordance with the description of those facilities in the appropriate Part of the Standard\".\nModern Fortran.\nThe language defined by the twenty-first century standards, in particular because of its incorporation of object-oriented programming support and subsequently Coarray Fortran, is often referred to as 'Modern Fortran', and the term is increasingly used in the literature.\nFortran 2003.\n\"Fortran 2003,\" officially published as ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004, was a major revision introducing many new features. A comprehensive summary of the new features of Fortran 2003 is available at the Fortran Working Group (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5) official Web site.\nFrom that article, the major enhancements for this revision include:\nAn important supplement to Fortran 2003 was the ISO technical report \"TR-19767: Enhanced module facilities in Fortran.\" This report provided \"sub-modules,\" which make Fortran modules more similar to Modula-2 modules. They are similar to Ada private child sub-units. This allows the specification and implementation of a module to be expressed in separate program units, which improves packaging of large libraries, allows preservation of trade secrets while publishing definitive interfaces, and prevents compilation cascades.\nFortran 2008.\nISO/IEC 1539-1:2010, informally known as Fortran 2008, was approved in September 2010. As with Fortran 95, this is a minor upgrade, incorporating clarifications and corrections to Fortran 2003, as well as introducing some new capabilities. The new capabilities include:\nThe Final Draft international Standard (FDIS) is available as document N1830.\nA supplement to Fortran 2008 is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Specification (TS) 29113 on \"Further Interoperability of Fortran with C\", which has been submitted to ISO in May 2012 for approval. The specification adds support for accessing the array descriptor from C and allows ignoring the type and rank of arguments.\nFortran 2018.\nThe Fortran 2018 revision of the language was earlier referred to as Fortran 2015. It was a significant revision and was released on November 28, 2018.\nFortran 2018 incorporates two previously published Technical Specifications:\nAdditional changes and new features include support for ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (the version of the IEEE floating-point standard before the latest minor revision IEEE ), hexadecimal input/output, IMPLICIT NONE enhancements and other changes.\nFortran 2018 deleted the arithmetic IF statement. It also deleted non-block DO constructs - loops which do not end with an END DO or CONTINUE statement. These had been an obsolescent part of the language since Fortran 90.\nNew obsolescences are: COMMON and EQUIVALENCE statements and the BLOCK DATA program unit, labelled DO loops, specific names for intrinsic functions, and the FORALL statement and construct.\nFortran 2023.\nFortran 2023 (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2023) was published in November 2023, and can be purchased from the ISO.\nFortran 2023 is a minor extension of Fortran 2018 that focuses on correcting errors and omissions\nin Fortran 2018. It also adds some small features, including an enumerated type capability.\nLanguage features.\nA full description of the Fortran language features brought by Fortran 95 is covered in the related article, \"Fortran 95 language features\". The language versions defined by later standards are often referred to collectively as 'Modern Fortran' and are described in the literature.\nScience and engineering.\nAlthough a 1968 journal article by the authors of BASIC already described FORTRAN as \"old-fashioned\", programs have been written in Fortran for many decades and there is a vast body of Fortran software in daily use throughout the scientific and engineering communities. Jay Pasachoff wrote in 1984 that \"physics and astronomy students simply have to learn FORTRAN. So much exists in FORTRAN that it seems unlikely that scientists will change to Pascal, Modula-2, or whatever.\" In 1993, Cecil E. Leith called FORTRAN the \"mother tongue of scientific computing\", adding that its replacement by any other possible language \"may remain a forlorn hope\".\nIt is the primary language for some of the most intensive super-computing tasks, such as in astronomy, climate modeling, computational chemistry, computational economics, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, data analysis, hydrological modeling, numerical linear algebra and numerical libraries (LAPACK, IMSL and NAG), optimization, satellite simulation, structural engineering, and weather prediction. Many of the floating-point benchmarks to gauge the performance of new computer processors, such as the floating-point components of the SPEC benchmarks (e.g., CFP2006, CFP2017) are written in Fortran. Math algorithms are well documented in Numerical Recipes.\nApart from this, more modern codes in computational science generally use large program libraries, such as METIS for graph partitioning, PETSc or Trilinos for linear algebra capabilities, deal.II or FEniCS for mesh and finite element support, and other generic libraries. Since the early 2000s, many of the widely used support libraries have also been implemented in C and more recently, in C++. On the other hand, high-level languages such as the Wolfram Language, MATLAB, Python, and R have become popular in particular areas of computational science. Consequently, a growing fraction of scientific programs are also written in such higher-level scripting languages. For this reason, facilities for inter-operation with C were added to Fortran 2003 and enhanced by the ISO/IEC technical specification 29113, which was incorporated into Fortran 2018 to allow more flexible interoperation with other programming languages.\nPortability.\nPortability was a problem in the early days because there was no agreed upon standard\u2014not even IBM's reference manual\u2014and computer companies vied to differentiate their offerings from others by providing incompatible features. Standards have improved portability. The 1966 standard provided a reference syntax and semantics, but vendors continued to provide incompatible extensions. Although careful programmers were coming to realize that use of incompatible extensions caused expensive portability problems, and were therefore using programs such as \"The PFORT Verifier,\" it was not until after the 1977 standard, when the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) published \"FIPS PUB 69\", that processors purchased by the U.S. Government were required to diagnose extensions of the standard. Rather than offer two processors, essentially every compiler eventually had at least an option to diagnose extensions.\nIncompatible extensions were not the only portability problem. For numerical calculations, it is important to take account of the characteristics of the arithmetic. This was addressed by Fox et al. in the context of the 1966 standard by the \"PORT\" library. The ideas therein became widely used, and were eventually incorporated into the 1990 standard by way of intrinsic inquiry functions. The widespread (now almost universal) adoption of the IEEE 754 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic has essentially removed this problem.\nAccess to the computing environment (e.g., the program's command line, environment variables, textual explanation of error conditions) remained a problem until it was addressed by the 2003 standard.\nLarge collections of library software that could be described as being loosely related to engineering and scientific calculations, such as graphics libraries, have been written in C, and therefore access to them presented a portability problem. This has been addressed by incorporation of C interoperability into the 2003 standard.\nIt is now possible (and relatively easy) to write an entirely portable program in Fortran, even without recourse to a preprocessor.\nObsolete variants.\nUntil the Fortran 66 standard was developed, each compiler supported its own variant of Fortran. Some were more divergent from the mainstream than others.\nThe first Fortran compiler set a high standard of efficiency for compiled code. This goal made it difficult to create a compiler so it was usually done by the computer manufacturers to support hardware sales. This left an important niche: compilers that were fast and provided good diagnostics for the programmer (often a student). Examples include Watfor, Watfiv, PUFFT, and on a smaller scale, FORGO, Wits Fortran, and Kingston Fortran 2.\nFortran 5 was marketed by Data General Corp from the early 1970s to the early 1980s, for the Nova, Eclipse, and MV line of computers. It had an optimizing compiler that was quite good for minicomputers of its time. The language most closely resembles FORTRAN 66.\nFORTRAN V was distributed by Control Data Corporation in 1968 for the CDC 6600 series. The language was based upon FORTRAN IV.\nUnivac also offered a compiler for the 1100 series known as FORTRAN V. A spinoff of Univac Fortran V was Athena FORTRAN.\nSpecific variants produced by the vendors of high-performance scientific computers (e.g., Burroughs, Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray, Honeywell, IBM, Texas Instruments, and UNIVAC) added extensions to Fortran to take advantage of special hardware features such as instruction cache, CPU pipelines, and vector arrays. For example, one of IBM's FORTRAN compilers (\"H Extended IUP\") had a level of optimization which reordered the machine code instructions to keep multiple internal arithmetic units busy simultaneously. Another example is \"CFD\", a special variant of FORTRAN designed specifically for the ILLIAC IV supercomputer, running at NASA's Ames Research Center.\nIBM Research Labs also developed an extended FORTRAN-based language called \"VECTRAN\" for processing vectors and matrices.\nObject-Oriented Fortran was an object-oriented extension of Fortran, in which data items can be grouped into objects, which can be instantiated and executed in parallel. It was available for Sun, Iris, iPSC, and nCUBE, but is no longer supported.\nSuch machine-specific extensions have either disappeared over time or have had elements incorporated into the main standards. The major remaining extension is OpenMP, which is a cross-platform extension for shared memory programming. One new extension, Coarray Fortran, is intended to support parallel programming.\n\"FOR TRANSIT\" was the name of a reduced version of the IBM 704 FORTRAN language, which was implemented for the IBM 650, using a translator program developed at Carnegie in the late 1950s. The following comment appears in the IBM Reference Manual (\"FOR TRANSIT Automatic Coding System\" C28-4038, Copyright 1957, 1959 by IBM):\nThe FORTRAN system was designed for a more complex machine than the 650, and consequently some of the 32 statements found in the FORTRAN Programmer's Reference Manual are not acceptable to the FOR TRANSIT system. In addition, certain restrictions to the FORTRAN language have been added. However, none of these restrictions make a source program written for FOR TRANSIT incompatible with the FORTRAN system for the 704.\nThe permissible statements were:\nUp to ten subroutines could be used in one program.\nFOR TRANSIT statements were limited to columns 7 through 56, only. Punched cards were used for input and output on the IBM 650. Three passes were required to translate source code to the \"IT\" language, then to compile the IT statements into SOAP assembly language, and finally to produce the object program, which could then be loaded into the machine to run the program (using punched cards for data input, and outputting results onto punched cards).\nTwo versions existed for the 650s with a 2000 word memory drum: FOR TRANSIT I (S) and FOR TRANSIT II, the latter for machines equipped with indexing registers and automatic floating-point decimal (bi-quinary) arithmetic. Appendix A of the manual included wiring diagrams for the IBM 533 card reader/punch control panel.\nFortran-based languages.\nPrior to FORTRAN 77, many preprocessors were commonly used to provide a friendlier language, with the advantage that the preprocessed code could be compiled on any machine with a standard FORTRAN compiler. These preprocessors would typically support structured programming, variable names longer than six characters, additional data types, conditional compilation, and even macro capabilities. Popular preprocessors included EFL, FLECS, iftran, MORTRAN, SFtran, S-Fortran, Ratfor, and Ratfiv. EFL, Ratfor and Ratfiv, for example, implemented C-like languages, outputting preprocessed code in standard FORTRAN 66. The PFORT preprocessor was often used to verify that code conformed to a portable subset of the language. Despite advances in the Fortran language, preprocessors continue to be used for conditional compilation and macro substitution.\nOne of the earliest versions of FORTRAN, introduced in the '60s, was popularly used in colleges and universities. Developed, supported, and distributed by the University of Waterloo, WATFOR was based largely on FORTRAN IV. A student using WATFOR could submit their batch FORTRAN job and, if there were no syntax errors, the program would move straight to execution. This simplification allowed students to concentrate on their program's syntax and semantics, or execution logic flow, rather than dealing with submission Job Control Language (JCL), the compile/link-edit/execution successive process(es), or other complexities of the mainframe/minicomputer environment. A down side to this simplified environment was that WATFOR was not a good choice for programmers needing the expanded abilities of their host processor(s), e.g., WATFOR typically had very limited access to I/O devices. WATFOR was succeeded by WATFIV and its later versions.\n (line programming)\nLRLTRAN was developed at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory to provide support for vector arithmetic and dynamic storage, among other extensions to support systems programming. The distribution included the Livermore Time Sharing System (LTSS) operating system.\nThe Fortran-95 Standard includes an optional \"Part 3\" which defines an optional conditional compilation capability. This capability is often referred to as \"CoCo\".\nMany Fortran compilers have integrated subsets of the C preprocessor into their systems.\nSIMSCRIPT is an application specific Fortran preprocessor for modeling and simulating large discrete systems.\nThe F programming language was designed to be a clean subset of Fortran 95 that attempted to remove the redundant, unstructured, and deprecated features of Fortran, such as the statement. F retains the array features added in Fortran 90, and removes control statements that were made obsolete by structured programming constructs added to both FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90. F is described by its creators as \"a compiled, structured, array programming language especially well suited to education and scientific computing\". Essential Lahey Fortran 90 (ELF90) was a similar subset.\nLahey and Fujitsu teamed up to create Fortran for the Microsoft .NET Framework. Silverfrost FTN95 is also capable of creating .NET code.\nCode examples.\nThe following program illustrates dynamic memory allocation and array-based operations, two features introduced with Fortran 90. Particularly noteworthy is the absence of loops and / statements in manipulating the array; mathematical operations are applied to the array as a whole. Also apparent is the use of descriptive variable names and general code formatting that conform with contemporary programming style. This example computes an average over data entered interactively.\nprogram average\n ! Read in some numbers and take the average\n ! As written, if there are no data points, an average of zero is returned\n ! While this may not be desired behavior, it keeps this example simple\n implicit none\n real, allocatable :: points(:)\n integer :: number_of_points\n real :: average_points, positive_average, negative_average\n average_points = 0.\n positive_average = 0.\n negative_average = 0.\n write (*,*) \"Input number of points to average:\"\n read (*,*) number_of_points\n allocate (points(number_of_points))\n write (*,*) \"Enter the points to average:\"\n read (*,*) points\n !

This proposal purported to address the confusion that sometimes arises between the letter \"O\" and the numeral zero, by eliminating the letter from allowable variable names. However, the method proposed was to eliminate the letter from the character set entirely (thereby retaining 48 as the number of lexical characters, which the colon had increased to 49). This was considered beneficial in that it would promote structured programming, by making it impossible to use the notorious statement as before. (Troublesome statements would also be eliminated.) It was noted that this \"might invalidate some existing programs\" but that most of these \"probably were non-conforming, anyway\".\nWhen X3J3 debated whether the minimum trip count for a DO loop should be zero or one in Fortran 77, Loren Meissner suggested a minimum trip count of two\u2014reasoning \"(tongue-in-cheek)\" that if it were less than two, then there would be no reason for a loop.\nWhen assumed-length arrays were being added, there was a dispute as to the appropriate character to separate upper and lower bounds. In a comment examining these arguments, Walt Brainerd penned an article entitled \"Astronomy vs. Gastroenterology\" because some proponents had suggested using the star or asterisk (\"*\"), while others favored the colon (\":\").\nVariable names beginning with the letters I\u2013N have a default type of integer, while variables starting with any other letters defaulted to real, although programmers could override the defaults with an explicit declaration. This led to the joke: \"In FORTRAN, GOD is REAL (unless declared INTEGER).\""}

It is Brazil's 4th largest city\u2014Fortaleza surpassed Salvador in 2022 census with a population of slightly over 2.4 million\u2014and 12th among cities with the highest gross domestic product. It forms the core of the Fortaleza metropolitan area, which is home to almost 4 million people.\nFortaleza is an important industrial and commercial center of Northeast Brazil. According to the Ministry of Tourism, it is the fourth most visited city and tourist destination in the country. The BR-116, the most important highway in the country, starts in Fortaleza. The municipality is part of the Mercosur common market, and vital trade port which is closest to mainland Europe, being from Lisbon, Portugal.\nTo the north of the city lies the Atlantic Ocean; to the south are the municipalities of Pacatuba, Eus\u00e9bio, Maracana\u00fa and Itaitinga; to the east is the municipality of Aquiraz and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west is the municipality of Caucaia. Residents of the city are known as \"Fortalezenses\". Fortaleza is one of the three leading cities in the Northeast region together with Recife and Salvador.\nHistory.\nColonial period.\nColonisation began in 1603 when Portugal was part of the Iberian Union, when the Portuguese Pero Coelho de Souza constructed the Fort of S\u00e3o Tiago and founded the settlement of \"Nova Lisboa\" (New Lisbon). After a victory over the French in 1612, Martins Soares Moreno expanded the Fort of S\u00e3o Tiago and changed its name to Forte de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o.\nIn 1630 the Dutch invaded the Brazilian Northeast and in 1637 they took the Fort of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o and ruled over Cear\u00e1. In battles with the Portuguese and natives in 1644 the fort was destroyed. Under captain Matthias Beck the Dutch West Indies Company built a new fortress by the banks of river Paje\u00fa. Fort \"Schoonenborch\" (\"graceful stronghold\") officially opened on 19 August 1649. After the capitulation of Pernambuco in 1654, the Dutch handed over this fortress to the Portuguese, who renamed it \"Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o\" (\"Fort of Our Lady of the Assumption\"), after which the city of Fortaleza takes its name.\nFortaleza was officially founded as a village 1726, becoming the capital of Cear\u00e1 state in 1799.\nImperial period.\nDuring the 19th century, Fortaleza was consolidated as an urban centre in Cear\u00e1, supported by the cotton industry. With the transformation of the city into a regional export center and with the increase of direct navigation to Europe, the customs building of Fortaleza was built in 1812. In 1824, the city was targeted by the revolutionaries of Confederation of the Equator.\nRepublican period.\nThe city gained a number of new districts in the 1930s, including Messejana and Porangaba.\nIn 1954, the first university in the city was created, the Universidade Federal do Cear\u00e1 (UFC).\nIn 1983 the city started to integrate the territory of the new city of Maracana\u00fa, which, just some years ago, was made again part of the Greater Fortaleza (the city's Metropolitan area). In the 1980s, Fortaleza exceeded Recife in population terms, becoming the second most populous city in Northeastern Brazil, with 2,571,896 inhabitants.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nFortaleza has a typical tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Aw/As\"), with high temperatures and relative humidity throughout the year. However, these conditions are usually relieved by pleasant winds blowing from the ocean. Average temperatures are not much different throughout the year. December is the warmest month, with a high of and low of . The rainy season spans from January to July, with rainfall particularly prodigious in March and April. The average annual temperature is . The relative humidity in Fortaleza is 77.5%, with average annual rainfall of . There is usually rain during the first seven months of the year from January to July. During this period, relative humidity is high. Fortaleza's climate is usually very dry from August to December, with very little rainfall.\nRainfall is akin to all of Northeastern Brazil among the most variable in the world, comparable (for similar average annual rainfalls) to central Queensland cities such as Townsville and Mackay. In the notorious drought year of 1877 as little as fell, and in 1958 only , but in the Nordeste's record wet year of 1985 Fortaleza received .\nVegetation.\nIn Fortaleza there are some remaining areas of mangrove in preserved areas, including Coc\u00f3 Park.\nTen miles offshore is the Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park, created in 1997 to protect the reefs.\nEcology and environment.\nThe vegetation of Fortaleza is typically coastal. The restinga areas are found in dune regions near the mouths of the Cear\u00e1, Coc\u00f3 and Pacoti rivers, in the beds of which there is still a mangrove forest. In other green areas of the city, there is no longer native vegetation, consisting of varied vegetation, fruit trees primarily. The city is home to seven environmental conservation units. These are the Sabiaguaba Dunes Municipal Natural Park, the Sabiaguaba Environmental Protection Area, the Maraponga Lagoon Ecological Park, the Coc\u00f3 Ecological Park, the Cear\u00e1 River Estuary Environmental Protection Area, the Environmental Protection Area of the Rio Pacoti and the Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park. There is also, in the city, the Area of Relevant Ecological Interest of S\u00edrio Curi\u00f3, that protects the last enclave of Atlantic Forest in the urban zone.\nThe Coc\u00f3 River is part of the river basin of the east coast of Cear\u00e1 and has a total length of about 50\u00a0km in its main area. The park is inserted in the area of greater environmental sensitivity of the city, where it is possible to identify geoenvironmental formations such as coastal plain, fluvial plain and surface of the coastal trays. The Coc\u00f3 river mangrove is home to mollusks, crustaceans, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. The park has a structure of visitation, with guides, ecological trails and equipment and events of environmental education and ecotourism. The Coa\u00e7u River, affluent of the river Coc\u00f3, forms in its bed the lagoon of the Precabura.\nThe Rio Pacoti provides much of the water supply for Fortaleza. At the municipal boundary with Caucaia, the estuary of the Rio Cear\u00e1 is covered by an environmental protection area (APA), which was set up in 1999.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2022 census, there were 2,428,708 people residing in the city of Fortaleza. The census revealed the following numbers: 1,456,901 Pardo (multiracial) people (60%), 793,975 White people (32.7%), 171,018 Black people (7%), 3,127 Asian people (0.1%), 3,000 Amerindian people (0.1%).\nIn 2010, the city of Fortaleza was the 5th most populous city proper in Brazil, after S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Bras\u00edlia. Currently, Fortaleza is the 4th largest city in Brazil in terms of population. In 2010, the city had 433,942 opposite-sex couples and 1,559 same-sex couples. The population of Fortaleza was 53.2% female and 46.8% male.\nThe following cities are included in the metropolitan area of Fortaleza (ordered by population): Fortaleza, Caucaia, Maracana\u00fa, Maranguape, Aquiraz, Pacatuba, Pacajus, Horizonte, S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Amarante, Itatinga, Guai\u00faba and Chorozinho.\nAccording to a genetic study from 2011, 'pardos' and whites' from Fortaleza, which comprise the largest share of the population, showed European ancestry of about 70%, the rest divided between Native American and African ancestries. A 2015 study, however, found out the following composition in Fortaleza: 48.9% of European contribution, 35.4% of Native American input and 15.7% of African ancestry.\nReligion.\nThe prevailing religion of Fortaleza is the Roman Catholic branch of Christianity.\n\"Source: IBGE 2000. \"\nAccording to the census of 2010, 1,664,521 people, 67.88% of the population, followed Roman Catholicism, 523,456 (21.35%) were Protestant, 31,691 (1.29%) represented Spiritism and 162,985 (6.65%) had no religion whatsoever. Other religions, such as Umbanda, Candombl\u00e9, other Afro-Brazilian religions, Spiritualism, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, other Eastern religions, Esotericism and other Christian churches like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) had a smaller number of adherents.\nPolitics.\nThe administration of the municipality is made from the executive and legislative branches. Former mayor Roberto Cl\u00e1udio, of the PDT, won 650,607 votes in the 2012 election, and was elected mayor. Legislative power rests with the City Council of Fortaleza, composed of 43 city councilors, elected for four-year terms, responsible for drafting municipal laws and supervising the executive. The municipality is, in addition, governed by organic law. In January 2015, there were 1,659,091 voters in Fortaleza (26.457% of the total state), distributed in thirteen electoral zones. The number of persons directly and indirectly employed in the municipal public administration in 2013 was respectively 31,318 and 4,950.\nThe city also houses the seat of state executive power, the Abolition Palace, previously occupied by former governor Camilo Santana, of the PT, elected in the general elections in Brazil in 2014. historically headquarters of the Iracema Club, which was Ceded to the Municipal Hall and now houses municipal executive bodies. In the city, there is the Administrative Center Governor Virg\u00edlio T\u00e1vora.\nAmong the institutions present in the city, are the Fortaleza Air Base, the Port Authority of Cear\u00e1, School of Apprentice Sailors of Cear\u00e1 and the Command of the Tenth Military Region. The city also has units of the International Committee of the Red Cross and UNICEF. Since 1996, a city is part of the Common Market of Cities of Mercosur.\nEconomy.\nFortaleza has the largest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Northeast Region, surpassing Recife and Salvador. In 2021, the GDP of Fortaleza reached the value of 73.4 billion Reais, the eleventh highest of the country. In the same year, the value of taxes on products net of subsidies at current prices was R$12,811,311,235 and the municipality's GDP per capita was R$27.164,45. The city's booming economy is reflected in purchasing power, the country's eighth largest, with estimated consumption potential at 42 billion reais in 2014.\nThe main economic source of the municipality is centered in the tertiary sector, with its diversified segments of commerce and service rendering. Next, the secondary sector stands out, with the industrial complexes. In 2021, the city had 848,283 people in employment.\nCulture.\nAccording to the Master Plan of Fortaleza, the Special Areas for the Preservation of Historic, Cultural and Archaeological Heritage are the regions of the center, Parangaba, Alagadi\u00e7o Novo/Jos\u00e9 de Alencar, Benfica, Porangabu\u00e7u and Praia de Iracema. Properties of conservation interest. The architectural heritage of Fortaleza in the form of fallen goods, however, is predominantly concentrated in the center of the city. The Mucuripe Lighthouse is unfortunately in ruins today, Cear\u00e1 and Fortaleza were part of the pioneering group of states and cities to adopt public policies to protect the living intangible heritage of their culture, through the Masters of Culture program.\nMuseums, theatres and cultural spaces.\nAmong the theaters, the largest and most popular are Theatro Jos\u00e9 de Alencar, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Theater, S\u00e3o Luiz Cinema Theater, and Teatro RioMar and Teatro Via Sul. The Cear\u00e1 Museum houses numerous artifacts, including pieces of paleontology and furniture. The Drag\u00e3o do Mar Center of Art and Culture is the main cultural centre, and includes the Cear\u00e1 Museum of Culture, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Cear\u00e1, theaters, a planetarium, cinemas, shops and spaces for public presentations, as well as housing the Public Library Governador Menezes Pimentel, Oporto Iracema of the Arts and the School of Arts and Crafts Thomaz Pompeu Sobrinho. The Casa de Jos\u00e9 de Alencar is one of the Brazilian museums recognised as dealing with Brazilian literature. It was opened in 1964 and houses art collections, a gallery, a library and the ruins of the first steam power plant in Cear\u00e1. In the different SERs of the city, the complexes of the CUCA Network are spread, which are facilities dedicated to art, leisure and education, especially for young people.\nFreemasonry is represented by the Grand Masonic Lodge of Cear\u00e1 and the Great State East of Cear\u00e1. There are also service clubs in the city, such as the Lions Club and Rotary International.\nThe Cear\u00e1 handicraft has its main market and showcase in Fortaleza. In the city, there are several specific places for trade in handicraft products, such as the Cear\u00e1 Craft Center (CeArt), Cear\u00e1 Tourism Center (Emcetur), Crafts Fair of Beira-Mar, and on Avenida Monsenhor Tabosa.\nLiterature and cinema.\nThe main literary manifestation of Fortaleza's history emerged at the end of the 19th century, in the cafes of Pra\u00e7a do Ferreira, known as the Spiritual Bakery, a pioneer in the dissemination of modern ideas in Brazilian literature that would only be adopted nationally in the following century, in the Modern Art Week. The most important historical entities of high culture still present in the city are the Cear\u00e1 Institute and the Cear\u00e1 Academy of Letters, the first academy of letters created in Brazil, founded in 1887 and 1894 respectively. The Cear\u00e1 Institute has helped launch important names in national historiography and philosophy, such as Farias Brito and Capistrano de Abreu. Among the writers who are members of the Cearense Academy of Letters and members or patrons of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, are Gustavo Barroso, Araripe J\u00fanior, Jos\u00e9 de Alencar, Her\u00e1clito Gra\u00e7a, Franklin Tavora, Cl\u00f3vis Bevil\u00e1qua and Rachel de Queiroz, the first woman to Be part of the entity. The Casa de Juvenal Galeno is another historical cultural institution of Fortaleza, named after one of the greatest poets born in the city, Juvenal Galeno. The house became well known for its festivals of poetry and seminaries.\nIn cinema, the most well known name is Zelito Viana, director of films like and \"Life and Death of Severina\". More recently, Karim A\u00efnouz has directed Madame Sat\u00e3, Suely in the Sky and Futuro Beach, and script of Lower City, Cinema, Aspirins and Vultures and Behind the Sun. Another current exponent of cinema born in Fortaleza is Halder Gomes, director and screenwriter of Holli\u00fady Cinema. New filmmakers in the city have gained in recent years prominent exhibitions such as at the Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival. The most traditional cinema event in Fortaleza is the Cine Cear\u00e1 (Ibero-American Film Festival), considered one of the main festivals of the country.\nFashion.\nThe main fashion name in the city is the , who, from Fortaleza, designed himself nationally and internationally and today is one of the main names of S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week, besides being one of the founding designers of this fashion week. There are major events in the city, such as the Drag\u00e3o Fashion Brasil, considered the largest fashion event in the Northeast and the third largest in the country.\nMuch of the clothing that is produced in Cear\u00e1 flows through Fortaleza, which in turn is recognized as one of the most important textile centers of the country, giving the garment industry great weight in the metropolitan economy. Brands of the city like Santana Textiles and headquarters of brands like Esplanada and Otoch have considerable regional influence.\nMusic.\nForr\u00f3 is the most popular musical genre in the city. Bands originating in Fortaleza, such as Desejo de Menina and Avi\u00f5es do Forr\u00f3, were responsible for the popularization of electronic forr\u00f3, which promoted the revaluation of the accordion in the genre and brought it closer to pop music. The forr\u00f3 p\u00e9-de serra, however, still holds great cultural influence and commercial prominence in the city.\nIn M\u00fasica popular brasileira, some of the names from Fortaleza were Fagner, Ednardo, Belchior (from Sobral but lived in Fortaleza) and Amelinha. The musical tradition of Fortaleza, however, goes back to the composer Alberto Nepomuceno, one of the greatest names in classical music in Brazil, a pioneer in the development of the country's musical nationalism, and therefore considered the \"founder of Brazilian music\". The Alberto Nepomuceno Conservatory is one of the city's leading music schools.\nCarnival.\nFortaleza hosts one of the noted Brazilian Carnivals. Its main locations are Iracema Beach and Avenue Domingos Olimpio.\nCuisine.\nThe gastronomy of Fortaleza is very close to the typical Northeastern cuisine, and, traditional include the \"bai\u00e3o de dois\", usually accompanied by barbecue of mutton or meat of sun, and tapioca which is a pancake made from the starch of cassava. The seafood is another ingredient of typical dishes of fortalezeense cuisine, such as the steak moqueca and the mackerel and snapper fish.\nThe fruit of the sea identity of the coast of the state is the crab. Shrimp and lobster are also widely used delicacies in dishes such as shrimp rice or shrimp dumplings.\nTourism.\nAcquario Cear\u00e1, due to be one of the largest oceanariums in Brazil, is currently under construction. Attractions such as the Beach Park theme park, located in the Great Fortaleza, Avenida Beira Mar and its bars, restaurants and music clubs, the beaches of Futuro and Iracema and Pirata Bar have placed Fortaleza among the Brazilian destinations preferred by Europeans.\nScuba diving is possible in the area of Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park, a marine protected area located about 10 nautical miles from the shoreline of Fortaleza.\nFortaleza has about of urban beaches. Mucuripe is the place where jangadas can be found. Still used by fishermen to go into high seas, jangadas can be seen along the way during the afternoon and evenings, and returning from the sea in the morning; part of the catch of the day is sold in an old-style fish market.\nEducation.\nIn 2010, the level of the education factor of the Strengthening Human Development Index was medium, despite its great advance, which went from 0.367 to 0.695 between 1991 and 2010. According to data from the 2010 Human Development Atlas of Brazil, Fortaleza's adult education levels were divided as follows: 8.57% did not complete primary school or were illiterate, 62.43% had completed elementary education, 45.93% had completed high school and 13.73% had completed higher education.\nHealth.\nThe health indexes of the Fortaleza population are better than the Brazilian average. According to data from 2010, the infant mortality rate up to one year old was 15.8 per 1000 live births in Fortaleza, against a Brazilian average of 16.7. By 2013, 90.6% of children under one year of age had their immunization records up to date. In 2012, 37,577 live births were registered, and the infant mortality rate up to five years of age was 13.2 per 1000. Of the total number of children under two years old weighed by the Family Health Program in 2013, 0.8% were malnourished.\nIn 2009, Fortaleza had a total of 35 general hospitals, of which 11 were public, 21 were private, two were philanthropic, and one was a trade union. The Doctor Jos\u00e9 Frota Institute is the largest hospital administered by the Municipal Government, and the General Hospital of Fortaleza is the largest hospital administered by the State Government. In addition, it had 54 specialized hospitals and eight polyclinics. The total number of physicians working in the health network of the municipality was 13,604, approximately 5.4 per thousand inhabitants. Fortaleza has 117 units of health posts, three administered by the municipality and six administered by the state. The first hospital built in Fortaleza was the Santa Casa de Miseric\u00f3rdia, founded in 1861. Among the most important public health institutions in the city, the most important is the Dr. Jos\u00e9 Frota Institute, the largest hospital administered by the Municipal Government, and the General Hospital of Fortaleza, the largest hospital administered by the State Government. Among the private institutions, the largest are the Unimed Fortaleza Regional Hospital, Ant\u00f4nio Prudente Hospital, Monte Klinikum Hospital and S\u00e3o Mateus Hospital.\nOne of the most important basic health programs in Fortaleza is the Family Health Program, within which the city is in third place in the country in extension of coverage, with hundreds of teams distributed in dozens of care units. The Emergency Mobile Care Service (SAMU) is the municipality's health care service, which serves an average of 200 daily occurrences.\nThe University Hospital Walter Cant\u00eddio is the largest liver transplantation facility in the country.

{"id": "11175", "revid": "43263260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11175", "title": "Political freedom", "text": "Political freedom (also known as political autonomy or political agency) is a central concept in history and political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies. Political freedom has been described as freedom from oppression or coercion, the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, or the absence of life conditions of compulsion in society, such as economic compulsion. \nAlthough political freedom is often interpreted negatively as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action, it can also refer to the positive exercise of rights, capacities and possibilities for action and the exercise of social or group rights. The concept can also include freedom from internal constraints on political action or speech such as social conformity, consistency, or inauthentic behaviour. The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of civil liberties and human rights, which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the state.\nViews.\nVarious groups along the political spectrum hold different views about what they believe constitutes political freedom.\nLeft-wing political philosophy generally couples the notion of freedom with that of positive liberty or the enabling of a group or individual to determine their own life or realize their own potential. In this sense, freedom may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease, and oppression as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.\nAccording to neoliberal philosopher and economist Friedrich Hayek, the \"socialist argument\" defined \"individual liberty\" as \" 'freedom from' obstacles\". He argued that this definition only \"confused\" and obscured the aim of \"securing individual freedom\", because it permitted a possible \"identification of freedom with power.\" The subsequent \"collective power over circumstances\" misappropriated \"the physical 'ability to do what I want', the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us.\" Hayek maintained that once any possible \"identification of freedom with power is admitted,\" a \"totalitarian state\" coalesced where \"liberty has been suppressed in the name of liberty.\"\nSocial anarchists see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one's labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by capitalism as \"selfish freedom\".\nPolitical philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.\nEconomist Milton Friedman argues in his book \"Capitalism and Freedom\" that there are two types of freedom, namely political freedom and economic freedom, and that without economic freedom there cannot be political freedom.\nIn his article \"Why the Market Subverts Democracy\", Robin Hahnel takes issue with Friedman's concept of economic freedom, asserting that there will be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom. He argues that such infringements produce conflicts that are resolved through property rights systems, and therefore it is essential to decide what is a better or a worse property rights system, yet Friedman simply takes for granted the existing property rights and does not question them.\nPolitical philosopher Nikolas Kompridis posits that the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals, namely freedom as autonomy or independence and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.\nPolitical freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to and a condition of power relations, or the power of action upon actions, by Michel Foucault. It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by Cornelius Castoriadis, Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re and Theodor Adorno.\nEnvironmentalists often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of ecosystems. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as freedom to pollute or freedom to deforest given that such activities create negative externalities, which violates other groups' liberty to not be exposed to pollution. The popularity of SUVs, golf and urban sprawl has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and ecological conservation can clash. This leads at times to serious confrontations and clashes of values reflected in advertising campaigns, e.g. that of PETA regarding fur.\nJohn Dalberg-Acton stated: \"The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities.\"\nGerald C. MacCallum Jr. spoke of a compromise between positive and negative freedoms, saying that an agent must have full autonomy over themselves. In this view, freedom is a triadic relationship because it is about three things, namely the agent, the constraints they need to be free from and the goal they are aspiring to.\nHistory.\nHannah Arendt traces the conceptual origins of freedom to ancient Greek politics. According to her study, the concept of freedom was historically inseparable from political action. Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of freedom of the will, or inner freedom, around the 5th century CE and since then freedom as a form of political action has been neglected even though, as she says, freedom is \"the raison d'\u00eatre of politics\".\nArendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to sovereignty or will-power since in ancient Greece and Rome the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance and did not arise as a conflict between the will and the self. Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to \"begin anew\", which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as \"new beginnings and hence beginners\".\nIn Arendt's view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of \"the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known\"."}

They have been used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept.\nThe style guide for Google developer documentation recommends against using them as example project names because they are unclear and can cause confusion.\nHistory and etymology.\nIt is possible that \"foobar\" is a playful allusion to the World War II-era military slang FUBAR (\"fucked up beyond all recognition)\".\nAccording to a RFC from the Internet Engineering Task Force, the word FOO originated as a nonsense word with its earliest documented use in the 1930s comic \"Smokey Stover\" by Bill Holman. Holman states that he used the word due to having seen it on the bottom of a jade Chinese figurine in San Francisco Chinatown, purportedly signifying \"good luck\". If true, this is presumably related to the Chinese word \"fu\" (\"\", sometimes transliterated \"foo\", as in \"foo dog\"), which can mean \"happiness\" or \"blessing\".\nThe first known use of the terms in print in a programming context appears in a 1965 edition of MIT's \"Tech Engineering News\". The use of \"foo\" in a programming context is generally credited to the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) of MIT from . In the complex model system, there were scram switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train moving at full power towards an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram switch, the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word \"FOO\"; at TMRC the scram switches are, therefore, called \"Foo switches\". Because of this, an entry in the 1959 \"Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" went something like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase 'foo mane padme hum.' Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.\" One book describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door labeled \"foo\" and \"bar\". These were general-purpose buttons and were often repurposed for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption of foo and bar as general-purpose variable names. An entry in the \"Abridged Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" states:\n\"Foobar\" was used as a variable name in the Fortran code of \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" (1977 Crowther and Woods version). The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player's progress in saying the magic phrase \"Fee Fie Foe Foo\", a phrase from an historical quatrain in the classic English fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk. Intel also used the term \"foo\" in their programming documentation in 1978."}
{"id": "11180", "revid": "12336988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11180", "title": "Functional analysis", "text": "Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis, the core of which is formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (for example, inner product, norm, or topology) and the linear functions defined on these spaces and suitably respecting these structures. The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of spaces of functions and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the Fourier transform as transformations defining, for example, continuous or unitary operators between function spaces. This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of differential and integral equations.\nThe usage of the word \"functional\" as a noun goes back to the calculus of variations, implying a function whose argument is a function. The term was first used in Hadamard's 1910 book on that subject. However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra. The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard, in particular Fr\u00e9chet and L\u00e9vy. Hadamard also founded the modern school of linear functional analysis further developed by Riesz and the group of Polish mathematicians around Stefan Banach.\nIn modern introductory texts on functional analysis, the subject is seen as the study of vector spaces endowed with a topology, in particular infinite-dimensional spaces. In contrast, linear algebra deals mostly with finite-dimensional spaces, and does not use topology. An important part of functional analysis is the extension of the theories of measure, integration, and probability to infinite-dimensional spaces, also known as infinite dimensional analysis.\nNormed vector spaces.\nThe basic and historically first class of spaces studied in functional analysis are complete normed vector spaces over the real or complex numbers. Such spaces are called Banach spaces. An important example is a Hilbert space, where the norm arises from an inner product. These spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, machine learning, partial differential equations, and Fourier analysis.\nMore generally, functional analysis includes the study of Fr\u00e9chet spaces and other topological vector spaces not endowed with a norm.\nAn important object of study in functional analysis are the continuous linear operators defined on Banach and Hilbert spaces. These lead naturally to the definition of C*-algebras and other operator algebras.\nHilbert spaces.\nHilbert spaces can be completely classified: there is a unique Hilbert space up to isomorphism for every cardinality of the orthonormal basis. Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are fully understood in linear algebra, and infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are isomorphic to formula_1. Separability being important for applications, functional analysis of Hilbert spaces consequently mostly deals with this space. One of the open problems in functional analysis is to prove that every bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space has a proper invariant subspace. Many special cases of this invariant subspace problem have already been proven.\nBanach spaces.\nGeneral Banach spaces are more complicated than Hilbert spaces, and cannot be classified in such a simple manner as those. In particular, many Banach spaces lack a notion analogous to an orthonormal basis.\nExamples of Banach spaces are formula_2-spaces for any real number Given also a measure formula_3 on set then sometimes also denoted formula_4 or has as its vectors equivalence classes formula_5 of measurable functions whose absolute value's formula_6-th power has finite integral; that is, functions formula_7 for which one has\nformula_8\nIf formula_3 is the counting measure, then the integral may be replaced by a sum. That is, we require\nformula_10\nThen it is not necessary to deal with equivalence classes, and the space is denoted written more simply formula_11 in the case when formula_12 is the set of non-negative integers.\nIn Banach spaces, a large part of the study involves the dual space: the space of all continuous linear maps from the space into its underlying field, so-called functionals. A Banach space can be canonically identified with a subspace of its bidual, which is the dual of its dual space. The corresponding map is an isometry but in general not onto. A general Banach space and its bidual need not even be isometrically isomorphic in any way, contrary to the finite-dimensional situation. This is explained in the dual space article.\nAlso, the notion of derivative can be extended to arbitrary functions between Banach spaces. See, for instance, the Fr\u00e9chet derivative article.\nMajor and foundational results.\nThere are four major theorems which are sometimes called the four pillars of functional analysis: \nImportant results of functional analysis include:\nUniform boundedness principle.\nThe uniform boundedness principle or Banach\u2013Steinhaus theorem is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis. Together with the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.\nThe theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn.\nSpectral theorem.\nThere are many theorems known as the spectral theorem, but one in particular has many applications in functional analysis.\nThis is the beginning of the vast research area of functional analysis called operator theory; see also the spectral measure.\nThere is also an analogous spectral theorem for bounded normal operators on Hilbert spaces. The only difference in the conclusion is that now formula_7 may be complex-valued.\nHahn\u2013Banach theorem.\nThe Hahn\u2013Banach theorem is a central tool in functional analysis. It allows the extension of bounded linear functionals defined on a subspace of some vector space to the whole space, and it also shows that there are \"enough\" continuous linear functionals defined on every normed vector space to make the study of the dual space \"interesting\".\nOpen mapping theorem.\nThe open mapping theorem, also known as the Banach\u2013Schauder theorem (named after Stefan Banach and Juliusz Schauder), is a fundamental result which states that if a continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is surjective then it is an open map. More precisely,\nThe proof uses the Baire category theorem, and completeness of both formula_12 and formula_15 is essential to the theorem. The statement of the theorem is no longer true if either space is just assumed to be a normed space, but is true if formula_12 and formula_15 are taken to be Fr\u00e9chet spaces.\nFoundations of mathematics considerations.\nMost spaces considered in functional analysis have infinite dimension. To show the existence of a vector space basis for such spaces may require Zorn's lemma. However, a somewhat different concept, the Schauder basis, is usually more relevant in functional analysis. Many theorems require the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, usually proved using the axiom of choice, although the strictly weaker Boolean prime ideal theorem suffices. The Baire category theorem, needed to prove many important theorems, also requires a form of axiom of choice.\nPoints of view.\nFunctional analysis includes the following tendencies:"}

Nicknamed the \"Chairman of the Board\", \"Ol' Blue Eyes\", and \"The Voice\", he is regarded as one of the . Sinatra is among the world's best-selling music artists, with an estimated 150 million record sales globally.\nBorn to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era and was influenced by the easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby. He joined the Harry James band as the vocalist in 1939 before finding success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". In 1946, Sinatra released his debut album, \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\". He then signed with Capitol Records and released several albums with arrangements by Nelson Riddle, notably \"In the Wee Small Hours\" (1955) and \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" (1956). In 1960, Sinatra left Capitol Records to start his own record label, Reprise Records, releasing a string of successful albums. He collaborated with Count Basie on ' (1962) and \"It Might as Well Be Swing\" (1964). In 1965, he recorded \"September of My Years\" and starred in the Emmy-winning television special '. After releasing \"Sinatra at the Sands\" in 1966, Sinatra recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, \"Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim\". It was followed by 1968's \"Francis A. &amp; Edward K.\" with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired in 1971 following the release of \"My Way\" but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and released \"New York, New York\" in 1980.\nSinatra also forged a highly successful acting career. After winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953), he starred in \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1955) and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as \"On the Town\" (1949), \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955), \"High Society\" (1956), and \"Pal Joey\" (1957), which won him a Golden Globe Award. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in \"Tony Rome\" (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn 1983, Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra received eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\" and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.\nEarly life.\nFrancis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in a tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey, the only child of Italian immigrants Natalina \"Dolly\" Garaventa and Antonino Martino \"Marty\" Sinatra. Sinatra weighed at birth and had to be with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his eardrum\u2014which remained damaged for the rest of his life. His grandmother resuscitated him by running him under cold water until he gasped. Due to his injuries, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he was further scarred by cystic acne. Sinatra was raised in the Catholic Church.\nSinatra's mother was energetic and driven; biographers believe that she was the dominant factor in the development of her son's personality and self-confidence. Sinatra's fourth wife Barbara would later claim that Dolly \"knocked him around a lot\" when he was a child. Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles. She worked as a midwife, and according to Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley, ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls, for which she was nicknamed \"Hatpin Dolly\". She had a gift for languages and served as a local interpreter.\nSinatra's illiterate father was a bantamweight boxer who later worked at the Hoboken Fire Department, working his way up to captain. Due to his illiteracy, he stressed the importance of a \"complete and full\" education and had instilled in his son the desire to become a civil engineer and enroll at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken. Sinatra spent much time at his parents' tavern in Hoboken, working on his homework and occasionally singing for spare change. During the Great Depression, Dolly provided money to her son for outings with friends and to buy expensive clothes, resulting in neighbors describing him as the \"best-dressed kid in the neighborhood\". Excessively thin and small as a child and young man, Sinatra's skinny frame later became a staple of jokes during stage shows.\nAt a young age, Sinatra developed an interest in music, particularly big band jazz and listened to Gene Austin, Rudy Vall\u00e9e, Russ Colombo, and Bob Eberly while idolizing Bing Crosby. For his 15th birthday, his uncle Domenico gave him a ukulele, with which he performed at family gatherings. Sinatra attended David E. Rue Jr. High School from 1928, and A. J. Demarest High School (since renamed as Hoboken High School) in 1931, where he arranged bands for school dances, but left without graduating after having attended only 47 days before being expelled for \"general rowdiness\". \nTo please his mother, he enrolled at Drake Business School, but departed after 11 months. Dolly found her son work as a delivery boy at the \"Jersey Observer\" newspaper (since merged into \"The Jersey Journal\"), where his godfather Frank Garrick worked; he later worked as a riveter at the Tietjen and Lang shipyard. He began performing in local Hoboken social clubs and sang for free on radio stations such as WAAT in Jersey City. In New York, Sinatra found jobs singing for his supper or for cigarettes. To improve his speech, he began taking elocution lessons for a dollar each from vocal coach John Quinlan, one of the first people to notice his impressive vocal range.\nMusic career.\n1935\u20131942: Hoboken Four, Harry James, and Tommy Dorsey.\nSinatra began singing professionally as a teenager. He never learned to read music but learned by ear. He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group called the 3 Flashes to let him join. Baritone Fred Tamburro stated that \"Frank hung around us like we were gods or something\", admitting that they only took him on board because he owned a car and could chauffeur the group. Sinatra soon learned they were auditioning for the \"Major Bowes Amateur Hour\" show and \"begged\" the group to let him join. \nWith Sinatra, the group became known as the \"Hoboken Four\" and passed an audition from Edward Bowes to appear on the show. They each earned $12.50, and attracted 40,000 votes to win first prize\u2014a six-month contract to perform on stage and radio across the U.S. Sinatra quickly became the group's lead singer, and, much to the jealousy of his fellow group members, garnered most of the attention from the girls. Due to the success of the group, Bowes kept asking for them to return, disguised under different names, varying from \"The Secaucus Cockamamies\" to \"The Bayonne Bacalas\".\nIn 1938, Sinatra found employment as a singing waiter at a roadhouse called \"The Rustic Cabin\" in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, for which he was paid $15 a week. The roadhouse was connected to the WNEW radio station in New York City, and he began performing with a group live during the \"Dance Parade\" show. Despite the low salary, Sinatra felt that this was the break he was looking for, and boasted to friends that he was going to \"become so big that no one could ever touch him\". In March 1939, saxophone player Frank Mane, who knew Sinatra from Jersey City radio station WAAT, arranged for him to audition and record \"Our Love\", his first solo studio recording. In June, bandleader Harry James, who had heard Sinatra sing on \"Dance Parade\", signed him to a two-year contract of $75 a week after a show at the Paramount Theatre in New York. It was with the James band that Sinatra released his first commercial record \"From the Bottom of My Heart\" in July. No more than 8,000 copies were sold, and further records released with James through 1939, such as \"All or Nothing at All\", also had weak sales on their initial release. Thanks to his vocal training, Sinatra could now sing two tones higher, and developed a repertoire which included songs such as \"My Buddy\", \"Willow Weep for Me\", \"It's Funny to Everyone but Me\", \"Here Comes the Night\", \"On a Little Street in Singapore\", \"Ciribiribin\", and \"Every Day of My Life\".\nSinatra became increasingly frustrated with the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra earned $125 a week, appearing at the Palmer House in Chicago, and James released Sinatra from his contract. \nOn January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with \"Stardust\". Dorsey recalled: \"You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matin\u00e9e idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos\". \nDorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that \"The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey.\" Though Kelley says that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.\nIn his first year with Dorsey, Sinatra recorded more than forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song \"Polka Dots and Moonbeams\" in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with \"Say It\" and \"Imagination\", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance (and his first on the first officially published \"Billboard\" chart) was \"I'll Never Smile Again\", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include \"Our Love Affair\" and \"Stardust\" in 1940; \"Oh! Look at Me Now\", \"Dolores\", \"Everything Happens to Me\", and \"This Love of Mine\" in 1941; \"Just as Though You Were There\", \"Take Me\", and \"There Are Such Things\" in 1942; and \"It Started All Over Again\", \"In the Blue of Evening\", and \"It's Always You\" in 1943. \nAs his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey to allow him to record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded \"Night and Day\", \"The Night We Called It a Day\", \"The Song is You\", and \"Lamplighter's Serenade\" at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: \"He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own\".\nAfter the 1942 recordings, Sinatra believed he needed to go solo, with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby, but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings. A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1942. On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bade farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying \"I hope you fall on your ass\", but he was more gracious on the air when replacing Sinatra with singer Dick Haymes. \nRumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey at gunpoint to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars. Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to come with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times his salary from Dorsey. Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never reconciled their differences.\n1942\u20131945: Onset of Sinatramania and Role in World War II.\nBy May 1941, Sinatra topped the male singer polls in \"Billboard\" and \"DownBeat\" magazines. His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls of that time were called, revealed a new audience for popular music, which had previously been recorded mainly for adults. The phenomenon became officially known as \"Sinatramania\" after his \"legendary opening\" at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. \nAccording to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, \"I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion... All this for a fellow I never heard of.\" Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as \"Swoonatra\" or \"The Voice\", and his fans \"Sinatratics\". They organized meetings and sent masses of letters of adoration, and within a few weeks of the show, some 1,000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US. \nSinatra's publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, Italian\u2013American with a rough childhood who made good. When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944, only 250 persons left the first show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in. Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write Sinatra's song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity to touch his bed, and steal clothing he was wearing, most commonly his bow tie.\nSinatra signed with Columbia Records as a solo artist on June 1, 1943, during the 1942\u201344 musicians' strike. Columbia Records re-released Harry James and Sinatra's August 1939 version of \"All or Nothing at All\", which reached number 2 on June 2 and was on the best-selling list for 18 weeks. He initially had great success, and performed on the radio on \"Your Hit Parade\" from February 1943 until December 1944, and on stage. \nColumbia wanted new recordings of their growing star as quickly as possible, so Alec Wilder was hired as an arranger and conductor for several sessions with a vocal group called the Bobby Tucker Singers. Of the nine songs recorded during these sessions, seven charted on the best-selling list. That year he made his first solo nightclub appearance at New York's Riobamba, and a successful concert in the Wedgewood Room of the prestigious Waldorf-Astoria New York that year secured his popularity in New York high society. Sinatra released \"You'll Never Know\", \"Close to You\", \"Sunday, Monday, or Always\" and \"People Will Say We're in Love\" as singles. By the end of 1943, he was more popular in a \"DownBeat\" poll than Bing Crosby.\nSinatra did not serve in the military during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified 4-F (\"Registrant not acceptable for military service\") by his draft board because of his perforated eardrum. However, Army files reported that Sinatra had actually been rejected because he was \"not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint;\" his emotional instability was hidden to avoid \"undue unpleasantness for both the selectee and the induction service\". Briefly, there were rumors reported by columnist Walter Winchell that Sinatra paid $40,000 to avoid military service, but the FBI found this to be without merit.\nToward the end of the war, Sinatra entertained the troops during several successful overseas USO tours with comedian Phil Silvers. During one trip to Rome, he met the Pope, who asked him if he was an operatic tenor. Sinatra worked frequently with the popular Andrews Sisters in radio in the 1940s, and many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In 1944, Sinatra released \"I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night\" as a single and recorded his own version of Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\". The following year he released \"I Dream of You (More Than You Dream I Do)\", \"Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)\", \"Dream\", and \"Nancy (with the Laughing Face)\" as singles.\n1946\u20131952: Columbia years and career slump.\nDespite being heavily involved in political activity in 1945 and 1946, in those two years, Sinatra sang on 160 radio shows, recorded 36 times, and shot four films. By 1946, he was performing on stage up to 45 times a week, singing up to 100 songs daily, and earning up to $93,000 a week.\nIn 1946, Sinatra released \"Oh! What it Seemed to Be\", \"Day by Day\", \"They Say It's Wonderful\", \"Five Minutes More\", and \"The Coffee Song\" as singles, and launched his first album, \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\", which reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" chart. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that Sinatra \"took the material very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter seriousness\" and that his \"singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs unusual depth of meaning.\" He was soon selling 10million records a year. \nSuch was Sinatra's command at Columbia that his love of conducting was indulged with the release of the set \"Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder\", an offering unlikely to appeal to Sinatra's core fanbase of teenage girls at the time. The following year he released his second album, \"Songs by Sinatra\", featuring songs of a similar mood and tempo such as Irving Berlin's \"How Deep is the Ocean?\" and Harold Arlen's and Jerome Kern's \"All The Things You Are\". \"Mam'selle\", composed by Edmund Goulding with lyrics by Mack Gordon for the film \"The Razor's Edge\" (1946), was released as a single. \nSinatra had competition; versions by Art Lund, Dick Haymes, Dennis Day, and The Pied Pipers also reached the top ten of the \"Billboard\" charts. In December, he recorded \"Sweet Lorraine\" with the Metronome All-Stars, featuring talented jazz musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Harry Carney and Charlie Shavers, with Nat King Cole on piano, in what Charles L. Granata describes as \"one of the highlights of Sinatra's Columbia epoch\".\nSinatra's third album, \"Christmas Songs by Sinatra\", was originally released in 1948 as a 78rpm album set, and a 10\" LP record was released two years later. When Sinatra was featured as a priest in \"The Miracle of the Bells\", due to press negativity surrounding his alleged Mafia connections at the time, it was announced to the public that Sinatra would donate his $100,000 in wages from the film to the Catholic Church. \nBy the end of 1948, Sinatra had slipped to fourth on \"DownBeat\"s annual poll of most popular singers, and in the following year he was pushed out of the top spots in polls for the first time since 1943. \"Frankly Sentimental\" (1949) was panned by \"DownBeat\", who commented that \"for all his talent, it seldom comes to life.\"\nThough \"The Hucklebuck\" reached the top ten, it was his last single release under the Columbia label. Sinatra's last two albums with Columbia, \"Dedicated to You\" and \"Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra\", were released in 1950. Sinatra would later feature a number of the \"Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra\" album's songs, including \"Lover\", \"It's Only a Paper Moon\", and \"It All Depends on You\", on his 1961 Capitol release, \"Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!\".\nCulminating the low of his career was the death of publicist George Evans in January 1950. According to Jimmy Van Heusen, Sinatra's close friend and songwriter, Evans's death to him was \"an enormous shock which defies words\", as he had been crucial to his career and popularity with the \"Bobby soxers\". \nSinatra's reputation continued to decline as reports broke in February of his affair with Ava Gardner and the destruction of his marriage to Nancy, though he insisted that his marriage had long been over even before he met Gardner. In April, Sinatra was engaged to perform at the Copa club in New York, but had to cancel five days of the booking due to a submucosal hemorrhage of the throat. Evans once said that whenever Sinatra suffered from a bad throat and loss of voice it was always due to emotional tension, which \"absolutely destroyed him\".\nIn financial difficulty following his divorce and career decline, Sinatra was forced to borrow $200,000 from Columbia to pay his back taxes after MCA refused to front the money. Rejected by Hollywood, he turned to Las Vegas and made his debut at the Desert Inn in September 1951, and also began singing at the Riverside Hotel in Reno, Nevada. \nSinatra's decline in popularity was evident in his concert appearances. At a brief run at the Paramount in New York, he drew small audiences. At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, he performed to half-filled houses. At a concert at Chez Paree in Chicago, only 150 people turned up in a 1,200-seat venue. By April 1952, he was performing at the Kauai County Fair in Hawaii. Sinatra's relationship with Columbia Records was disintegrating, with A&amp;R executive Mitch Miller claiming he \"couldn't give away\" Sinatra records. Though several notable recordings were made during this time period, such as \"If I Could Write a Book\" in January 1952, which Granata sees as a \"turning point\", forecasting his later work with its sensitivity, \nColumbia and MCA dropped him later that year. His last studio recording for Columbia, \"Why Try To Change Me Now\", was recorded in New York on September 17, 1952, with an orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith. Journalist Burt Boyar observed, \"Sinatra had had it. It was sad. From the top to the bottom in one horrible lesson.\"\n1953\u20131960: Career Revival and the Capitol years.\nThe release of the film \"From Here to Eternity\" in August 1953 marked the beginning of a remarkable career revival. Tom Santopietro notes that Sinatra began to bury himself in his work, with an \"unparalleled frenetic schedule of recordings, movies and concerts\", in what authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan describe as \"a new and brilliant phase\". \nOn March 13, 1953, Sinatra met with Capitol Records vice president Alan Livingston and signed a seven-year recording contract. His first session for Capitol took place at KHJ studios at Studio C, 5515 Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, with Axel Stordahl conducting. The session produced four recordings, including \"I'm Walking Behind You\", Sinatra's first Capitol single. \nAfter spending two weeks on location in Hawaii filming \"From Here to Eternity\", Sinatra returned to KHJ on April 30 for his first recording session with Nelson Riddle, an established arranger and conductor at Capitol who was Nat King Cole's musical director. After recording the first song, \"I've Got the World on a String\", Sinatra offered Riddle a rare expression of praise, \"Beautiful!\", and after listening to the playbacks, he could not hide his enthusiasm, exclaiming, \"I'm back, baby, I'm back!\"\nIn subsequent sessions in May and November 1953, Sinatra and Riddle developed and refined their musical collaboration, with Sinatra providing specific guidance on the arrangements. Sinatra's first album for Capitol, \"Songs for Young Lovers\", was released on January 4, 1954, and included \"A Foggy Day\", \"I Get a Kick Out of You\", \"My Funny Valentine\", \"Violets for Your Furs\", and \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\", songs which became staples of his later concerts. \nThat same month, Sinatra released the single \"Young at Heart\", which reached No. 2 and was awarded Song of the Year. In March, he recorded and released the single \"Three Coins in the Fountain\", a \"powerful ballad\" that reached No. 4. Sinatra's second album with Riddle, \"Swing Easy!\", which reflected his \"love for the jazz idiom\" according to Granata, was released on August 2 of that year and included \"Just One of Those Things\", \"Taking a Chance on Love\", \"Get Happy\", and \"All of Me\". \"Swing Easy!\" was named Album of the Year by \"Billboard\", and he was named \"Favorite Male Vocalist\" by \"Billboard\", \"DownBeat\", and \"Metronome\" that year. \nSinatra came to consider Riddle \"the greatest arranger in the world\", and Riddle, who considered Sinatra, \"a perfectionist\", said: \"It's not only that his intuitions as to tempo, phrasing, and even configuration are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable... There is still no one who can approach him.\"\nSinatra became one of Las Vegas's pioneer residency entertainers, and a prominent figure on the Vegas scene throughout the 1950s and 1960s onwards, a period described by Rojek as the \"high-water mark\" of Sinatra's \"hedonism and self-absorption\". Rojek notes that the Rat Pack \"provided an outlet for gregarious banter and wisecracks\" but argues that it was Sinatra's vehicle, possessing an \"unassailable command over the other performers\". Sinatra would fly to Las Vegas from Los Angeles in Van Heusen's plane. On October 4, 1953, Sinatra made his first performance at the Sands Hotel and Casino, after an invitation by the manager Jack Entratter. Sinatra typically performed there three times a year and later acquired a share in the hotel.\nIn 1955, Sinatra released \"In the Wee Small Hours\", his first 12\" LP, featuring songs such as \"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\", \"Mood Indigo\", \"Glad to Be Unhappy\" and \"When Your Lover Has Gone\". According to Granata it was the first concept album of his to make a \"single persuasive statement\", with an extended program and \"melancholy mood\". Sinatra embarked on his first tour of Australia the same year. \nAnother collaboration with Riddle resulted in \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\", sometimes seen as one of his best albums, which was released in March 1956. It features a recording of \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" by Cole Porter, which reportedly took 22 takes to perfect.\nHis February 1956 recording sessions inaugurated the studios at the Capitol Records Building, complete with a 56-piece symphonic orchestra. According to Granata, his recordings of \"Night and Day\", \"Oh! Look at Me Now\", and \"From This Moment On\" revealed \"powerful sexual overtones, stunningly achieved through the mounting tension and release of Sinatra's best-teasing vocal lines\", while his recording of \"River, Stay 'Way from My Door\" in April demonstrated his \"brilliance as a syncopational improviser\". \nRiddle said that Sinatra took \"particular delight\" in singing \"The Lady is a Tramp\", commenting that he \"always sang that song with a certain amount of salaciousness\", making \"cue tricks\" with the lyrics. His penchant for conducting was displayed again in 1956's \"Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color\", an instrumental album that has been interpreted to be a catharsis to his failed relationship with Gardner. Sinatra also sang at that year's Democratic National Convention and performed with The Dorsey Brothers for a week soon afterward at the Paramount Theatre.\nIn 1957, Sinatra released \"Close to You\", \"A Swingin' Affair!\", and \"Where Are You?\"\u2014his first album in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins. Granata considers \"Close to You\" to have been thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the \"golden\" era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was \"extremely progressive\" by the standards of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs \"With Every Breath I Take\", \"Blame It on My Youth\" and \"It Could Happen to You\". For Granata, Sinatra's \"A Swingin' Affair!\" and \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" solidified \"Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual standpoint.\" Buddy Collette considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by Sammy Davis Jr. and stated that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s, he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s. \nOn June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the Seattle Civic Auditorium, his first appearance in Seattle since 1945. The recording was first released as a bootleg, but Artanis Entertainment Group officially released it as \"Sinatra '57 in Concert\" in 1999, after Sinatra's death. \nIn 1958, Sinatra released the concept album \"Come Fly with Me\" with Billy May, designed as a musical world tour. It reached the top spot on the \"Billboard\" album chart in its second week, remaining at the top for five weeks, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the inaugural Grammy Awards. The title song, \"Come Fly With Me\", written especially for him, would become one of his best-known standards. On May 29, he recorded seven songs in a single session, more than double the usual yield of a recording session, and an eighth, \"Lush Life\", was abandoned as Sinatra found it too technically demanding. In September, Sinatra released \"Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely\", a stark collection of introspective saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads, which proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on \"Billboard\"s album chart and peaking at No. 1. Cuts from this LP, such as \"Angel Eyes\" and \"One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)\", would remain staples of the \"saloon song\" segments of Sinatra's concerts.\nIn 1959, Sinatra released \"Come Dance with Me!\", a highly successful, critically acclaimed album that stayed on \"Billboard\"s Pop album chart for 140 weeks, peaking at No. 2. It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, as well as Best Vocal Performance, Male and Best Arrangement for Billy May. \nHe released \"No One Cares\" in the same year, a collection of \"brooding, lonely\" torch songs, which critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought was \"nearly as good as its predecessor \"Where Are You?\", but lacked the \"lush\" arrangements of it and the \"grandiose melancholy\" of \"Only the Lonely\".\nIn the words of Kelley, by 1959, Sinatra was \"not simply the leader of the Rat Pack\" but had \"assumed the position of \"il padrone\" in Hollywood.\" He was asked by 20th Century Fox to be the master of ceremonies at a luncheon attended by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on September 19, 1959. \"Nice 'n' Easy\", a collection of ballads, topped the \"Billboard\" chart in October 1960 and remained in the charts for 86 weeks, winning critical plaudits.\n1960\u20131969: Reprise years.\nSinatra grew discontented at Capitol and feuded with Alan Livingston, which lasted over six months. His first attempt at owning his own label was with his pursuit of buying declining jazz label Verve Records, which ended once an initial agreement with Verve founder Norman Granz \"failed to materialize\". \nHe decided to form his own label, Reprise Records, and, in an effort to assert his new direction, temporarily parted with Riddle, May and Jenkins, working with other arrangers such as Neil Hefti, Don Costa, and Quincy Jones. Sinatra built the appeal of Reprise Records as one in which artists were promised creative control, as well as a guarantee that they would eventually gain \"complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights.\" \nUnder Sinatra the company developed into a music industry \"powerhouse\", and he later sold it for an estimated $80million. His first album on the label, \"Ring-a-Ding-Ding!\" (1961), was a major success, peaking at No.4 on \"Billboard\". The album was released in February 1961, the same month that Reprise Records released Ben Webster's \"The Warm Moods\", Sammy Davis Jr.'s \"The Wham of Sam\", Mavis River's \"Mavis\" and Joe E. Lewis's \"It is Now Post Time\". During the initial years of Reprise, Sinatra was still under contract to record for Capitol, completing his contractual commitment with the release of \"Point of No Return\", recorded on September 11 and 12, 1961.\nIn 1962, Sinatra released \"Sinatra and Strings\", a set of standard ballads arranged by Don Costa, which became one of the most critically acclaimed works of Sinatra's Reprise period. Frank Jr., who was present during the recording, noted the \"huge orchestra\", which Nancy Sinatra stated \"opened a whole new era\" in pop music, with orchestras getting bigger, embracing a \"lush string sound\". \nSinatra and Count Basie collaborated for the album \"\" the same year, a popular and successful release which prompted them to rejoin two years later for the follow-up \"It Might as Well Be Swing\", arranged by Quincy Jones. The two became frequent performers together, and appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1965. Also in 1962, as the owner of his own record label, Sinatra was able to step on the podium as conductor again, releasing his third instrumental album \"Frank Sinatra Conducts Music from Pictures and Plays\".\nIn 1963, Sinatra reunited with Nelson Riddle for \"The Concert Sinatra\", an ambitious album featuring a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Riddle. The concert was recorded on a motion picture scoring soundstage with the use of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed an optical signal onto 35mm film designed for movie soundtracks. Granata considers the album to have been \"impeachable\" [sic], \"one of the very best of the Sinatra-Riddle ballad albums\", in which Sinatra displayed his vocal range, particularly in \"Ol' Man River\", in which he darkened the hue.\nIn 1964, the song \"My Kind of Town\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Sinatra released \"Softly, as I Leave You\", and collaborated with Bing Crosby and Fred Waring on \"America, I Hear You Singing\", a collection of patriotic songs recorded as a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Sinatra increasingly became involved in charitable pursuits in this period. In 1961 and 1962, he went to Mexico to put on performances for Mexican charities. and in July 1964, he was present at the dedication of the Frank Sinatra International Youth Center for Arab and Jewish children in Nazareth.\nSinatra's phenomenal success in 1965, coinciding with his 50th birthday, prompted \"Billboard\" to proclaim that he may have reached the \"peak of his eminence\". In June 1965, Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and Dean Martin played live in St. Louis to benefit Dismas House, a prisoner rehabilitation and training center with nationwide programs that, in particular, helped serve black Americans. \nThe Rat Pack concert, called The Frank Sinatra Spectacular, was broadcast live via satellite to numerous movie theaters across America. The album \"September of My Years\" was released September 1965, and went on to win the Grammy Award for best album of the year. Granata considers the album to have been one of the finest of his Reprise years, \"a reflective throwback to the concept records of the 1950s, and more than any of those collections, distills everything that Frank Sinatra had ever learned or experienced as a vocalist\". One of the album's singles, \"It Was a Very Good Year\", won the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male. A career anthology, \"A Man and His Music\", followed in November, winning Album of the Year at the Grammys the following year.\nIn 1966, Sinatra released \"That's Life\", with both the single of \"That's Life\" and album becoming Top Ten hits on \"Billboard\"s pop charts. \"Strangers in the Night\" went on to top the \"Billboard\" and UK pop singles charts, winning the award for Record of the Year at the Grammys. Sinatra's first live album, \"Sinatra at the Sands\", was recorded during January and February 1966 at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Sinatra was backed by the Count Basie Orchestra, with Quincy Jones conducting. Sinatra pulled out from the Sands the following year when he was driven out by its new owner Howard Hughes after a fight.\nSinatra started 1967 with a series of recording sessions with Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim. He recorded one of his collaborations with Jobim, the Grammy-nominated album \"Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim\", which was one of the best-selling albums of the year, behind the Beatles's \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". \nAccording to Santopietro the album \"consists of an extraordinarily effective blend of bossa nova and slightly swinging jazz vocals, and succeeds in creating an unbroken mood of romance and regret.\" Writer Stan Cornyn wrote that Sinatra sang so softly on the album that it was comparable to the time that he suffered from a vocal hemorrhage in 1950.\nSinatra released the album \"The World We Knew\", which features a chart-topping duet of \"Somethin' Stupid\" with daughter Nancy. In December, Sinatra collaborated with Duke Ellington on the album \"Francis A. &amp; Edward K.\". According to Granata, the recording of \"Indian Summer\" on the album was a favorite of Riddle's, noting the \"contemplative mood [which] is heightened by a Johnny Hodges alto sax solo that will bring a tear to your eye\". \nWith Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter Paul Anka wrote the song \"My Way\", using the melody of the French \"Comme d'habitude\" (\"As Usual\"), composed by Claude Fran\u00e7ois and Jacques Revaux. Sinatra recorded it in one take, just after Christmas 1968. \"My Way\", Sinatra's best-known song on the Reprise label, was not an instant success, charting at No. 27 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. However, it remained in the UK charts for 122 weeks, including 75 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 40, between April 1969 and September 1971, which was still a record in 2015. Sinatra told songwriter Ervin Drake in the 1970s that he \"detested\" singing the song because he believed audiences would think it was a \"self-aggrandizing tribute\". According to NPR, \"My Way\" has become one of the most requested songs at funerals.\nIn an effort to maintain his commercial viability in the late 1960s, Sinatra would record works by Paul Simon (\"Mrs. Robinson\"), the Beatles (\"Yesterday\"), and Joni Mitchell (\"Both Sides, Now\") in 1969.\n1970\u20131981: \"Retirement\" and return.\nIn 1970, Sinatra released \"Watertown\", a critically acclaimed concept album, with music by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes. However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. \nHe left Caesars Palace in September of that year after an incident in which executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood to raise money for the Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He gave a \"rousing\" performance of \"That's Life\", and finished the concert with a Matt Dennis and Earl Brent song, \"Angel Eyes\" which he had recorded on the \"Only the Lonely\" album in 1958. He sang the last line. \"'Scuse me while I disappear.\" The spotlight went dark, and he left the stage. \nHe told \"LIFE\" journalist Thomas Thompson that \"I've got things to do, like the first thing is not to do at all for eight months... maybe a year\", while Barbara Sinatra later said that Sinatra had grown \"tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by\". Around this time, Sinatra designed \"Villa Maggio\", a holiday home and retreat near Palm Desert. While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing \"My Kind of Town\" for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972.\nIn 1973, Sinatra came out of his short-lived retirement with a television special and album. The album, entitled \"Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back\", arranged by Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa, was a success, reaching number 13 on \"Billboard\" and number 12 in the UK. The television special, \"Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra\", reunited Sinatra with Gene Kelly. \nHe initially developed problems with his vocal cords during the comeback due to a prolonged period without singing. That Christmas, he performed at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas, and returned to Caesars Palace the following month in January 1974. He began what Barbara Sinatra describes as a \"massive comeback tour of the United States, Europe, the Far East, and Australia.\" In July, while on a second tour of Australia, he caused an uproar by describing journalists therewho were aggressively pursuing his every move and pushing for a press conferenceas \"bums, parasites, fags, and buck-and-a-half hookers.\" After he was pressured to apologize, Sinatra instead insisted that the journalists apologize for \"fifteen years of abuse I have taken from the world press.\" Union actions canceled concerts and grounded Sinatra's plane, essentially trapping him in Australia. \nSinatra's lawyer, Mickey Rudin, arranged for Sinatra to issue a written conciliatory note and a final concert that was televised to the nation. In October 1974, he appeared at New York City's Madison Square Garden in a televised concert that was later released as an album under the title \"The Main Event\u00a0\u2013 Live\". Backing him was bandleader Woody Herman and the Young Thundering Herd, who accompanied Sinatra on a European tour later that month.\nIn 1975, Sinatra performed in concerts in New York with Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald, and at the London Palladium with Basie and Sarah Vaughan, and in Tehran , giving 140 performances in 105 days. In August he held several concerts at Lake Tahoe together with the newly risen singer John Denver, who became a frequent collaborator. Sinatra had recorded Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\" and \"My Sweet Lady\" for \"Sinatra &amp; Company\" (1971), and according to Denver, his song \"A Baby Just Like You\" was written at Sinatra's request for his new grandchild, Angela. \nDuring the Labor Day weekend held in 1976, Sinatra was responsible for reuniting old friends and comedy partners Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis for the first time in nearly twenty years, when they performed at the \"Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon\". That year, the Friars Club selected him as the \"Top Box Office Name of the Century\", and he was given the Scopus Award by the American Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Nevada.\nSinatra continued to perform at Caesars Palace in the late 1970s and was performing there in January 1977 when his mother Dolly died in a plane crash on the way to see him. He canceled two weeks of shows and spent time recovering from the shock in Barbados. In March, he performed in front of Princess Margaret at the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising money for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. On March 14, he recorded with Nelson Riddle for the last time, recording the songs \"Linda\", \"Sweet Lorraine\", and \"Barbara\". The two men had a major falling out and later patched up their differences in January 1985 at a dinner organized for Ronald Reagan when Sinatra asked Riddle to make another album with him. Riddle was ill at the time and died that October before they had a chance to record.\nIn 1978, Sinatra filed a $1million lawsuit against a land developer for using his name in the \"Frank Sinatra Drive Center\" in West Los Angeles. During a party at Caesars in 1979, he was awarded the Grammy Trustees Award, while celebrating 40 years in show business and his 64th birthday. That year, former President Gerald Ford awarded Sinatra the International Man of the Year Award, and he performed in front of the Egyptian pyramids for Anwar Sadat, which raised more than $500,000 for Sadat's wife's charities.\nIn 1980, Sinatra's first album in six years was released, \"\", a highly ambitious triple album that features an array of songs from both the pre-rock and rock eras. It was the first studio album of Sinatra's to feature his touring pianist at the time, Vinnie Falcone, and was based on an idea by Sonny Burke. The album garnered six Grammy nominations\u2013 winning for best liner notes\u2013 and peaked at number 17 on \"Billboard\"s album chart, and spawned yet another song that would become a signature tune, \"Theme from New York, New York\". \nThat year, as part of the Concert of the Americas, he performed in the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which broke records for the \"largest live paid audience ever recorded for a solo performer\". The following year, Sinatra built on the success of \"Trilogy\" with \"She Shot Me Down\", an album that was praised for embodying the dark tone of his Capitol years. Also in 1981, Sinatra was embroiled in controversy when he worked a 10-day engagement for $2million in Sun City, in the internationally unrecognized Bophuthatswana, breaking a cultural boycott against apartheid-era South Africa. President Lucas Mangope awarded Sinatra with the highest honor, the Order of the Leopard, and made him an honorary tribal chief.\n1982\u20131998: Later career and final projects.\nSantopietro stated that by the early 1980s, Sinatra's voice had \"coarsened, losing much of its power and flexibility, but audiences didn't care.\" In 1982, he signed a $16million three-year deal with the Golden Nugget of Las Vegas. \nKelley notes that by this period, Sinatra's voice had grown \"darker, tougher and loamier\", but he \"continued to captivate audiences with his immutable magic.\" She added that his baritone voice \"sometimes cracked, but the gliding intonations still aroused the same raptures of delight as they had at the Paramount Theater.\" \nThat year, he made a reported further $1.3million from the Showtime television rights to his \"Concert of the Americas\" in the Dominican Republic, $1.6million for a concert series at Carnegie Hall, and $250,000 in just one evening at the Chicago Fest. He donated a lot of his earnings to charity. He put on a performance at the White House for Italian president Sandro Pertini, and performed at the Radio City Music Hall with Luciano Pavarotti and George Shearing.\nSinatra was honored at the 1983 Kennedy Center Honors, alongside Katherine Dunham, James Stewart, Elia Kazan, and Virgil Thomson. Quoting Henry James, President Reagan said in honoring his old friend that \"art was the shadow of humanity\" and that Sinatra had \"spent his life casting a magnificent and powerful shadow.\" \nOn September 21, 1983, Sinatra filed a $2million court case against Kitty Kelley, suing her for punitive damages, before her unofficial biography, \"His Way\", was even published. The book became a best-seller for \"all the wrong reasons\" and \"the most eye-opening celebrity biography of our time\", according to William Safire of \"The New York Times\". Sinatra was always adamant that such a book would be written on his terms, and he himself would \"set the record straight\" in details of his life. \nAccording to Kelley, the family detested her and the book, which took its toll on Sinatra's health. Kelley says that Tina Sinatra blamed her for her father's colon surgery in 1986. He was forced to drop the case on September 19, 1984, with several leading newspapers expressing concerns about censorship.\nIn 1984, Sinatra worked with Quincy Jones for the first time in nearly two decades on the album \"L.A. Is My Lady\", which was well received critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played many large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them, and the two never spoke again.\nOn June 6, 1988, Sinatra made his last recordings with Reprise for an album that was not released. He recorded \"My Foolish Heart\", \"Cry Me a River\", and other songs. Sinatra never completed the project, but take number 18 of \"My Foolish Heart\" may be heard in \"The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings\" (1995).\nIn 1990, Sinatra was awarded the second \"Ella Award\" by the Los Angeles-based Society of Singers, and performed for a final time with Ella Fitzgerald at the award ceremony. Sinatra maintained an active touring schedule in the early 1990s, performing 65 concerts in 1990, 73 in 1991, and 84 in 1992 in seventeen countries.\nIn 1993, Sinatra returned to Capitol Records and the recording studio for \"Duets\", which became his best-selling album. The album and its sequel, \"Duets II\", released the following year, would see Sinatra remake his classic recordings with popular contemporary performers, who added their vocals to a pre-recorded tape.\nDuring his tours in the early 1990s, his memory failed him at times during concerts, and he fainted onstage in Richmond, Virginia in March 1994. His final public concerts were held in Fukuoka Dome in Japan on December 19\u201320, 1994. The following year, Sinatra sang for the last time on February 25, 1995, before a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament. \n\"Esquire\" reported of the show that Sinatra was \"clear, tough, on the money\" and \"in absolute control\". Sinatra was awarded the Legend Award at the 1994 Grammy Awards, where he was introduced by Bono, who said of him, \"Frank's the chairman of the bad attitude... Rock 'n roll plays at being tough, but this guy is the boss\u2013 the chairman of boss\".\nIn 1995, to mark Sinatra's 80th birthday, the Empire State Building glowed blue. A star-studded birthday tribute, \"Sinatra: 80 Years My Way\", was held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, featuring performers such as Ray Charles, Little Richard, Natalie Cole and Salt-N-Pepa singing his songs. At the end of the program, Sinatra performed on stage for the last time to sing the final notes of the \"Theme from New York, New York\" with an ensemble. In recognition of his many years of association with Las Vegas, Sinatra was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 1997.\nArtistry.\nWhile Sinatra never learned how to read music well, he had a natural understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. He could follow a lead sheet (simplified sheet music showing a song's basic structure) during a performance by \"carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page\" and made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semitonal differences. \nGranata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding and remarked that Sinatra had a \"sixth sense\", which \"demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra.\" \nSinatra was an aficionado of classical music, and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as Puccini and Impressionist masters. His personal favorite was Ralph Vaughan Williams. He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a \"certain feeling\" to perform live surrounded by musicians.\nBy the mid-1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an air check of some compositions by Alec Wilder, which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions. The works were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present. Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody \"This Happy Madness\", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on \"Sinatra &amp; Company\" (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.\nVoice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, \"He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either\". As a singer, early on, he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby, but later believed that Tony Bennett was \"the best singer in the business.\" Bennett himself claimed that as a performer, Sinatra had \"perfected the art of intimacy.\" According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a \"fairly rangy voice\", remarking that \"His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint\". \nDespite his heavy New Jersey accent, when Sinatra sang, his accent was barely detectable; according to Richard Schuller, his diction became \"precise\" while singing and his articulation \"meticulous\". His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to \"toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric.\" Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would \"take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.\" Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone, and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.\nArrangers such as Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a perfectionist who constantly drove himself and others around him, stating that his collaborators approached him with uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament. \nGranata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others. On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians. \nAfter a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could and made friends with many of them. Over the years, he recorded 87 of Sammy Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number and would often make comments to the audience, such as \"Isn't that a pretty ballad\" or \"Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song\", delivered with \"childlike delight\". She states that after each show, Sinatra would be \"in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given.\"\nSinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a \"brooding melancholy\", such as \"I'm a Fool to Want You\", \"Don't Worry 'Bout Me\", \"My One and Only Love\" and \"There Will Never Be Another You\", which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. \nLahr comments that the new Sinatra was \"not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt\". Author Granata considered Sinatra a \"master of the art of recording\", noting that his work in the studio \"set him apart from other gifted vocalists.\" During his career, he made over 1000 recordings. Recording sessions would typically last three hours. However, Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound. \nDuring his Columbia years, Sinatra used an RCA Type 44 microphone, which Granata describes as \"the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s\". At Capitol, he used a Neumann U 47, an \"ultra-sensitive\" microphone that better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.\nIn the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. Up to sixteen songs could now be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track into a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme\". Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, \"Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art\".\nFilm career.\n1941\u20131952: Debut, musical films, and career slump.\nSinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic about his own acting, once remarking that \"pictures stink\". Sinatra made his film debut performing in an uncredited sequence in \"Las Vegas Nights\" (1941), singing \"I'll Never Smile Again\" with Tommy Dorsey's Pied Pipers. He had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's \"Reveille with Beverly\" (1943), making a brief appearance singing \"Night and Day\". Next, he was given leading roles in \"Higher and Higher\" and \"Step Lively\" (both 1944) for RKO.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical \"Anchors Aweigh\" (1945), in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song \"I Fall in Love Too Easily\", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. He briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful \"Till the Clouds Roll By\" (1946), a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang \"Ol' Man River\".\nSinatra co-starred again with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" (1949), in which they play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in \"On the Town\" (1949), playing a sailor on leave in New York City. The film remains rated very highly by critics, and in 2006, it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both \"Double Dynamite\" (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's \"Meet Danny Wilson\" (1952) failed to make an impression.\n1953\u20131959: Career comeback and prime.\nFred Zinnemann's \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953) deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role that would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \"Maggio\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture. The \"Los Angeles Examiner\" wrote that Sinatra is \"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\", commenting that his death scene is \"one of the best ever photographed\".\nSinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film \"Young at Heart\" (1954), and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir \"Suddenly\" (1954).\nSinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1955). After roles in \"Guys and Dolls\", and \"The Tender Trap\" (both 1955), Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a medical student in Stanley Kramer's directorial d\u00e9but, \"Not as a Stranger\" (1955). During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed at the time never to hire Sinatra again and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in \"The Pride and the Passion\" (1957).\nSinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in \"High Society\" (1956) for MGM, earning a reported $250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over $13million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of its year. He starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's \"Pal Joey\" (1957), for which Sinatra won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \"The Lady Is a Tramp\" to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in \"The Joker Is Wild\" (1957); the song \"All the Way\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958, Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's \"Some Came Running\" and \"Kings Go Forth\" (both 1958) with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \"High Hopes\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, \"A Hole in the Head\" (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks.\n1960\u20131980: Later career.\nDue to an obligation, he owed to 20th Century Fox for walking off the set of Henry King's \"Carousel\" (1956), Sinatra starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan in \"Can-Can\" (1960). He earned $200,000 and 25% of the profits for the performance. Around the same time, he starred in the Las Vegas-set \"Ocean's 11\" (1960), the first film to feature the Rat Pack together and the start of a \"new era of screen cool\" for Santopietro. Sinatra personally financed the film and paid Martin and Davis fees of $150,000 and $125,000, respectively, sums considered exorbitant for the period. He had a leading role opposite Laurence Harvey in \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962), which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high point of his film career. Vincent Canby, writing for the magazine \"Variety\", found the portrayal of Sinatra's character to be \"a wide-awake pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity.\" He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western \"Sergeants 3\" (1962), and again in the 1964 gangster-oriented musical \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\". For his performance in \"Come Blow Your Horn\" (1963), adapted from the Neil Simon play, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\nSinatra directed \"None but the Brave\" (1965), and \"Von Ryan's Express\" (1965) was a major success. In the late 1960s, Sinatra became known for playing detectives, including Tony Rome in \"Tony Rome\" (1967) and its sequel \"Lady in Cement\" (1968). He played a similar role in \"The Detective\" (1968). As \"Die Hard\" was based on the novel sequel to \"The Detective\", the studio was contractually obliged to offer Sinatra the role. Sinatra, who was 70 at the time, declined.\nSinatra starred opposite George Kennedy in the western \"Dirty Dingus Magee\" (1970), an \"abysmal\" affair according to Santopietro, which was panned by the critics. The following year, Sinatra received a Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award and had intended to play Detective Harry Callahan in \"Dirty Harry\" (1971), but had to turn down the role due to developing Dupuytren's contracture in his hand. Sinatra's last major film role was opposite Faye Dunaway in Brian G. Hutton's \"The First Deadly Sin\" (1980). Santopietro said that as a troubled New York City homicide cop, Sinatra gave an \"extraordinarily rich\", heavily layered characterization, one which \"made for one terrific farewell\" to his film career.\nTelevision and radio career.\nAfter beginning on the \"Major Bowes Amateur Hour\" radio show with the Hoboken Four in 1935, and later WNEW and WAAT in Jersey City, Sinatra became the star of radio shows of his own on NBC and CBS from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s. In 1942, Sinatra hired arranger Axel Stordahl away from Tommy Dorsey before he began his first radio program that year, keeping Stordahl with him for all of his radio work.. By the end of 1942, he was named the \"Most Popular Male Vocalist on Radio\" in a \"DownBeat\" poll. Early on he frequently worked with The Andrews Sisters on radio. They would appear as guests on each other's shows, as well as on many USO shows broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). He appeared as a special guest in the sisters' ABC \"Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch\" series, while the trio in turn guested on his \"Songs by Sinatra\" series on CBS. Sinatra had two stints as a regular member of the cast of \"Your Hit Parade\"; his first was from 1943 to 1945, and second was from 1946 to May 28, 1949, during which he was paired with the then-new girl singer, Doris Day. Starting in September 1949, the BBD&amp;O advertising agency produced a radio series starring Sinatra for Lucky Strike called \"Light Up Time\"\u2013 some 176 15-minute shows that featured him and Dorothy Kirsten singing\u2013 which lasted through to May 1950.\nIn October 1951, the second season of \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" began on CBS Television. Ultimately, Sinatra did not find the success on television for which he had hoped. Santopietro writes that Sinatra \"never appeared fully at ease on his own television series.\" In 1953 and 1954, Sinatra starred in the NBC radio program \"Rocky Fortune\", portraying Rocco Fortunato (a.k.a. Rocky Fortune).\nIn 1957, Sinatra formed a three-year $3million contract with ABC to launch \"The Frank Sinatra Show\", featuring himself and guests in 36 half-hour shows. ABC agreed to allow Sinatra's Hobart Productions to keep 60% of the residuals and bought stock in Sinatra's film production unit, Kent Productions, guaranteeing him $7million. Though an initial critical success upon its debut on October 18, 1957, it soon attracted negative reviews from \"Variety\" and \"The New Republic\", and \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" thought that Sinatra and frequent guest Dean Martin \"performed like a pair of adult delinquents\", \"sharing the same cigarette and leering at girls.\" In return, Sinatra later made numerous appearances on \"The Dean Martin Show\" and Martin's TV specials.\nSinatra's fourth and final Timex TV special, ', was broadcast in March 1960, earning massive viewing figures. During the show, he performed a duet with Presley, who sang Sinatra's 1957 hit \"Witchcraft\" with the host performing the 1956 Presley classic \"Love Me Tender\". Sinatra had previously been highly critical of Elvis Presley and rock and roll in the 1950s, describing it as a \"deplorable, a rancid smelling aphrodisiac\" that \"fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people.\" A CBS News special about Sinatra's 50th birthday, ', was broadcast on November 16, 1965, and received an Emmy award and a Peabody Award.\nContinuing his musical collaboration with Jobim and Ella Fitzgerald in 1967, Sinatra appeared in the TV special, \"A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim\", which was broadcast on CBS on November 13. When Sinatra came out of retirement in 1973, he appeared in a TV special that shared its title with his contemporaneously released album, \"Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back\". In the late 1970s, John Denver appeared as a guest in the \"Sinatra and Friends\" ABC-TV Special, singing \"September Song\" as a duet.\nSinatra starred as a detective in \"Contract on Cherry Street\" (1977), cited as his \"one starring role in a dramatic television film\". Ten years later, he made a guest appearance opposite Tom Selleck in \"Magnum, P.I.\". Shot in January 1987, the episode aired on CBS on February 25.\nPersonal life.\nSinatra was married to Nancy Sinatra (n\u00e9e Barbato) from 1939 to 1951. The couple had three children, Nancy (born 1940), Frank Jr. (1944\u20132016), and Tina (born 1948).\nSinatra met Barbato in Long Branch, New Jersey, in the summer of 1934 while working as a lifeguard. He agreed to marry her after an incident at \"The Rustic Cabin\" that led to his arrest. Sinatra had numerous extramarital affairs, and gossip magazines published details of affairs with women including Marilyn Maxwell, Lana Turner, Joi Lansing, and Marilyn Monroe.\nSinatra was married to Hollywood actress Ava Gardner from 1951 to 1957. It was a turbulent marriage with many well-publicized fights and altercations. The couple formally announced their separation on October 29, 1953, through MGM. Gardner filed for divorce in June 1954, at a time when she was dating matador Luis Miguel Domingu\u00edn, but the divorce was not settled until 1957. Sinatra continued to feel very strongly for her, and they remained friends for life.\nSinatra reportedly broke off engagements to Lauren Bacall in 1958 and Juliet Prowse in 1962. He was romantically linked to Pat Sheehan, Vikki Dougan, and Kipp Hamilton. Sinatra and Mia Farrow were married on July 19, 1966, and the couple divorced in August 1968. They remained close friends for life, and in a 2013 interview, Farrow said that Sinatra might be the father of her son, Ronan Farrow (born 1987). In a 2015 \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview, Nancy Sinatra dismissed the claim as \"nonsense\". She said that her father had a vasectomy years before Farrow's birth.\nSinatra was married to Barbara Marx from 1976 until his death. The couple married on July 11, 1976, at Sunnylands, in Rancho Mirage, California, the estate of media magnate Walter Annenberg.\nSinatra was close friends with Jilly Rizzo, songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen, golfer Ken Venturi, comedian Pat Henry, baseball manager Leo Durocher, and president John F. Kennedy (for whom he organized an inaugural ball with Peter Lawford). In his spare time, he enjoyed listening to classical music. He swam daily in the Pacific Ocean. He often played golf with Venturi at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived in the house \"Twin Palms\" he had commissioned from E. Stewart Williams in 1947 He liked painting, reading, and building model railways.\nThough Sinatra was critical of the church on numerous occasions and had a pantheistic, Einstein-like view of God in his earlier life, he was inducted into the Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1976, and he turned to Catholicism for healing after his mother died in a plane crash in 1977. He died as a practicing Catholic and had a Catholic burial.\nStyle and personality.\nSinatra was known for his immaculate sense of style. He spent lavishly on expensive custom-tailored tuxedos and stylish pin-striped suits, which made him feel wealthy and important and that he was giving his very best to the audience. He was also obsessed with cleanliness\u2014while with the Tommy Dorsey band, he developed the nickname \"Lady Macbeth\" because of frequent showering and switching his outfits. His deep blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\".\nFor Santopietro, Sinatra was the personification of America in the 1950s: \"cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full of the sense of possibility.\" Barbara Sinatra wrote, \"A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor.\" Cary Grant, a friend of Sinatra, stated that Sinatra was the \"most honest person he'd ever met\", who spoke \"a simple truth, without artifice which scared people\", and was often moved to tears by his performances. Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed \"great inner strength\" and that his energy and drive were \"enormous.\" A workaholic, he reportedly only slept four hours a night on average. Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, stating to an interviewer in the 1950s that \"I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation.\" Barbara Sinatra stated that he would \"snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor\", while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk, it was \"best to disappear.\"\nSinatra's mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists, and photographers. According to Rojek, he was \"capable of deeply offensive behavior that smacked of a persecution complex.\" He received negative press for fights with Lee Mortimer in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser in Houston in 1950, Judy Garland's publicist Jim Byron on the Sunset Strip in 1954, and for a confrontation with \"Washington Post\" journalist Maxine Cheshire in 1973, in which he implied that she was a cheap prostitute. His feud with then-\"Chicago Sun Times\" columnist Mike Royko began when Royko wrote a column questioning why Chicago police offered free protection to Sinatra when he had his own security. Sinatra wrote an angry letter in response, calling Royko a \"pimp\" and threatening to \"punch you in the mouth\" for speculating that he wore a toup\u00e9e.\nSinatra was also known for his generosity, particularly after his comeback. Kelley notes that when Lee J. Cobb nearly died from a heart attack in June 1955, Sinatra flooded him with \"books, flowers, delicacies\", paid his hospital bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his \"finest acting\" was yet to come.\nAlleged organized-crime links and Cal Neva Lodge.\nSinatra became the stereotype of the \"tough working-class Italian American\", something which he embraced. He said that if it had not been for his interest in music, he would have likely ended up in a life of crime. Willie Moretti was Sinatra's godfather and the notorious underboss of the Genovese crime family, and he helped Sinatra in exchange for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing Sinatra from his contract with Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra was present at the Mafia Havana Conference in 1946, and the press learned of his being there with Lucky Luciano. One newspaper published the headline \"Shame, Sinatra\". He was reported to be a good friend of mobster Sam Giancana, Kelley quoted Jo-Carrol Silvers that Sinatra \"adored\" Bugsy Siegel and boasted to friends about him and how many people Siegel had killed. Kelley says that Sinatra and mobster Joseph Fischetti had been good friends from 1938 onward and acted like \"Sicilian brothers\". She also states that Sinatra and Hank Sanicola were financial partners with Mickey Cohen in the gossip magazine \"Hollywood Night Life\".\nThe FBI kept records amounting to 2,403 pages on Sinatra, who was a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, his ardent New Deal politics, and his friendship with John F. Kennedy. The FBI kept him under surveillance for almost five decades beginning in the 1940s. The documents include accounts of Sinatra as the target of death threats and extortion schemes. The FBI documented that Sinatra was losing esteem with the Mafia as he grew closer to President Kennedy, whose younger brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was leading a crackdown on organized crime. Sinatra said he was not involved: \"Any report that I fraternized with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie.\"\nIn 1960, Sinatra bought a share in the Cal Neva Lodge &amp; Casino, a casino hotel on the south shore of Lake Tahoe. Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted his show business friends Red Skelton, Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet Prowse, the McGuire Sisters, and others. By 1962, he reportedly held a 50-percent share in the hotel. Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily suspended by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on the premises. Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission on mobster control of casinos, Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands. That year, his son Frank Jr. was kidnapped but was eventually released unharmed. Sinatra's gambling license was restored in February 1981, following support from Ronald Reagan.\nPolitical views and activism.\nSinatra held varied political views throughout his life. His mother, Dolly, was a Democratic Party ward leader. After meeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, he subsequently heavily campaigned for the Democrats in the 1944 presidential election. According to Jo Carroll Silvers, in his younger years, Sinatra had \"ardent liberal\" sympathies and was \"so concerned about poor people that he was always quoting Henry Wallace.\" He was outspoken against racism, particularly toward black people and Italians, from a young age. In the early 1950s, he was among those who campaigned to combine the racially segregated musicians' unions in Los Angeles. In November 1945, Sinatra was invited by the mayor of Gary, Indiana, to try to settle a strike by white students of Froebel High School against the \"Pro-Negro\" policies of the new principal. His comments, while praised by liberal publications, led to accusations by some that he was a communist, which he denied. In the 1948 presidential election, Sinatra actively campaigned for President Harry S. Truman. In 1952 and 1956, he campaigned for Adlai Stevenson.\nOf all the U.S. presidents he associated with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy. Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, and the two would womanize and enjoy parties together. In January 1961, Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office. After taking office, Kennedy distanced himself from Sinatra due partly to Sinatra's ties with the Mafia. In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by the President as, during his visit to his Palm Springs, Kennedy stayed with the Republican Bing Crosby instead of Sinatra, citing FBI concerns about the latter's alleged connections to organized crime. Sinatra had spared no expense upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he smashed with a sledgehammer after the rejection. Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days. Sinatra worked with Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, and remained a supporter of the Democratic Party until the early 1970s. Although still a registered Democrat, Sinatra endorsed Republican Ronald Reagan for a second term as Governor of California in 1970. He officially changed allegiance in July 1972 when he supported Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election.\nIn the 1980 presidential election, Sinatra donated $4million to Ronald Reagan's campaign. Sinatra arranged Reagan's Presidential gala, as he had done for Kennedy. In 1985, Reagan presented Sinatra with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, remarking, \"His love of country, his generosity for those less fortunate... make him one of our most remarkable and distinguished Americans.\"\nIn June 1984, Sinatra performed at the State Dinner in the White House honoring Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayawardena at the invitation of Reagan.\nSantopietro notes that Sinatra was a \"lifelong sympathizer with Jewish causes.\" He was awarded the Hollzer Memorial Award by the Los Angeles Jewish Community in 1949. He gave a series of concerts in Israel in 1962 and donated his entire $50,000 fee for appearing in a cameo role in \"Cast a Giant Shadow\" (1966) to the Youth Center in Jerusalem. On November 1, 1972, he raised $6.5million in bond pledges for Israel, and was given the Medallion of Valor for his efforts. The Frank Sinatra Student Center at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was dedicated in his name in 1978.\nFrom his youth, Sinatra displayed sympathy for black Americans and worked both publicly and privately all his life to help the struggle for equal rights. He blamed racial prejudice on the parents of children. Sinatra played a major role in the desegregation of Nevada hotels and casinos in the 1950s and 1960s. On January 27, 1961, Sinatra played a benefit show at Carnegie Hall for Martin Luther King Jr. and led his fellow Rat Pack members and Reprise label mates in boycotting hotels and casinos that refused entry to black patrons and performers. According to his son, Frank Jr., King sat weeping in the audience at one of his father's concerts in 1963 as Sinatra sang \"Ol' Man River\", a song from the musical \"Show Boat\" that is sung by a black American stevedore. When he changed his political affiliations in 1970, Sinatra became less outspoken on racial issues. Though he did much towards civil rights causes, it did not stop the occasional racial jibe from him and the other Rat Pack members toward Davis at concerts.\nDeath and funeral.\nDuring the final years of his life, Sinatra was in ill health and was frequently hospitalized for heart and breathing problems, high blood pressure, pneumonia, and bladder cancer. He made no public appearances following a heart attack in February 1997. On the night of May 14, 1998, Sinatra died of another heart attack at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, with his wife Barbara at his side; he was 82. Barbara encouraged Sinatra to \"fight\" while attempts were made to stabilize him, and reported that his final words were, \"I'm losing.\" Sinatra's daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her siblings had not been notified of their father's final hospitalization, and it was her belief that \"the omission was deliberate. Barbara would be the grieving widow \"alone\" at her husband's side.\" The night after Sinatra's death, the lights on the Empire State Building were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for one minute. Significant increases in recording sales worldwide were reported by \"Billboard\" in the month of his death.\nSinatra's funeral was held at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, California, on May 20, 1998, with 400 mourners in attendance and thousands of fans outside. Gregory Peck, Tony Bennett, and Sinatra's son, Frank Jr., addressed the mourners, who included many people from entertainment.\nSinatra was buried in a blue business suit; his grave, adorned with mementos from family members, was next to his parents in Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California. The phrases \"The Best Is Yet to Come\", and \"Beloved Husband &amp; Father\" were placed on Sinatra's modest grave marker. Sinatra's gravestone was changed to read \"Sleep Warm, Poppa\", due to damage caused to the original gravestone under mysterious circumstances, according to the magazine \"Palm Springs Life\".\nLegacy and honors.\nRobert Christgau referred to Sinatra as \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\". His popularity is matched only by Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson. For Santopietro, Sinatra was the \"greatest male pop singer in the history of America\", who amassed \"unprecedented power onscreen and off\", and \"seemed to exemplify the common man, an ethnic twentieth-century American male who reached the 'top of the heap', yet never forgot his roots.\" Santopietro argues that Sinatra created his world, which he was able to dominate\u2014his career was centered around power, perfecting the ability to capture an audience.\nGus Levene commented that Sinatra's strength was that when it came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a \"genius\" ability and feeling, which with the \"rare combination of voice and showmanship\" made him the \"original singer\" which others who followed most tried to emulate. George Roberts, a trombonist in Sinatra's band, remarked that Sinatra had a \"charisma, or whatever it is about him, that no one else had.\" Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that \"If Las Vegas had not existed, Sinatra could have invented it.\" He quoted reporter James Bacon in saying that Sinatra was the \"swinging image on which the town is built\", adding that no other entertainer quite \"embodied the glamour\" associated with Las Vegas. Sinatra is seen as one of the icons of the 20th century, and has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in film and music.\nIn Sinatra's native Hoboken, he was awarded the Key to the City by Mayor Fred M. De Sapio on October 30, 1947. In 2003, the city's main post office was rededicated in his honor. A bronze plaque, placed two years before Sinatra's death in 1998, marks the site of the house where he was born. There is also a marker in front of Hoboken Historical Museum, which has artifacts from his life and conducts Sinatra walking tours. Frank Sinatra Drive runs parallel to the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. On the waterfront is Frank Sinatra Park, where a bronze plaque was placed in 1989 upon its opening. In the Frank Sinatra Park, a tall bronze statue of Sinatra was dedicated in 2021 on December 12, Sinatra's birthday. A residence hall at Montclair State University in New Jersey was named in his honor. Other buildings named for Sinatra include the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens, the Frank Sinatra International Student Center at Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem dedicated in 1978, and the Frank Sinatra Hall at the USC School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles, California, dedicated in 2002. Wynn Resorts' Encore Las Vegas resort features a restaurant dedicated to Sinatra which opened in 2008. There are several streets and roads named in honor of Frank Sinatra in several states of the U.S.\nVarious items of memorabilia from Sinatra's life and career, such as Frank Sinatra's awards, gold records, and various personal items, are displayed at USC's Frank Sinatra Hall in Los Angeles and at Wynn Resort's Sinatra restaurant in Las Vegas.\nThe United States Postal Service issued a 42-cent stamp in honor of Sinatra in May 2008, commemorating the tenth anniversary of his death.\nThe United States Congress passed a resolution on May 20, 2008, designating May 13 as Frank Sinatra Day.\nSinatra received three Honorary Degrees during his lifetime. In May 1976, he was invited to speak at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas graduation commencement held at Sam Boyd Stadium. It was at this commencement that he was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate litterarum humanarum by the university. During his speech, Sinatra stated that his education had come from \"the school of hard knocks\" and that \"this is the first educational degree I have ever held in my hand. I will never forget what you have done for me today\". In 1984 and 1985, Sinatra received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Loyola Marymount University and an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology.\nIn 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Sinatra at No. 19 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\nIn 2024, a new road in North Bristol was named \"Sinatra Way\", to commemorate Sinatra's 1953 visit to Frenchay Hospital, which used to sit at the site of a new housing development.\nFilm, television and stage portrayals.\nA television miniseries based on Sinatra's life, titled \"Sinatra\", was aired by CBS in 1992. The series was directed by James Steven Sadwith, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Directing for a Miniseries or a Special and starred Philip Casnoff as Sinatra. \"Sinatra\" was written by Abby Mann and Philip Mastrosimone and produced by Sinatra's daughter, Tina.\nSinatra has subsequently been portrayed on screen by Ray Liotta (\"The Rat Pack\", 1998), James Russo (\"Stealing Sinatra\", 2003), Dennis Hopper (\"The Night We Called It a Day\", 2003), and Robert Knepper (\"My Way\", 2012), and spoofed by Joe Piscopo and Phil Hartman on \"Saturday Night Live\". A biographical film directed by Martin Scorsese has long been planned. A 1998 episode of the BBC documentary series \"Arena\", \"The Voice of the Century\", focused on Sinatra. Alex Gibney directed a four-part biographical series on Sinatra, \"All or Nothing at All\", for HBO in 2015. A musical tribute was aired on CBS television in December 2015 to mark Sinatra's centenary. Sinatra was also portrayed by Rico Simonini in the 2018 feature film \"Frank &amp; Ava\", which is based on a play by Willard Manus. Creed singer Scott Stapp also portrayed Sinatra in the 2024 feature film \"Reagan\", a biopic of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Martin Scorsese planned to make a film on Sinatra and his second wife Ava Gardner.\nSinatra believed that Johnny Fontane, a mob-associated singer in Mario Puzo's novel \"The Godfather\" (1969), was based on him. Puzo wrote in 1972 that when the author and singer met in Chasen's, Sinatra \"started to shout abuse\", calling Puzo a \"pimp\" and threatening violence. Francis Ford Coppola, director of the film adaptation, said in the audio commentary that \"Obviously Johnny Fontane was inspired by a kind of Frank Sinatra character\".\nIn 2023, a biopic jukebox stage musical titled \"\" by Joe DiPietro premiered at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre starring Tony Award-winning actor Matt Doyle as Sinatra.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nCollaboration albums"}
{"id": "11182", "revid": "869314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11182", "title": "Funeral", "text": "A funeral is a ceremony connected with the final disposition of a corpse, such as a burial or cremation, with the attendant observances. Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember and respect the dead, from interment, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honour. Customs vary between cultures and religious groups. Funerals have both normative and legal components. Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation.\nThe funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final disposition. Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by cremation, sky burial, decomposition, disintegration or dissolution) or its preservation (for example, by mummification). Differing beliefs about cleanliness and the relationship between body and soul are reflected in funerary practices. A memorial service (service of remembrance or celebration of life) is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person. In both a closed casket funeral and a memorial service, photos of the deceased representing stages of life would be displayed on an altar. Relatives or friends would give out eulogies in both services as well.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"funeral\" comes from the Latin \"funus\", which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. Funerary art is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of tombs, and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a corpse.\nOverview.\nFuneral rites pre-date modern \"Homo sapiens\" and dated to at least 300,000 years ago. For example, in the Shanidar Cave in Iraq, in Pontnewydd Cave in Wales and at other sites across Europe and the Near East, Archaeologists have discovered Neanderthal skeletons with a characteristic layer of flower pollen. This deliberate burial and reverence given to the dead has been interpreted as suggesting that Neanderthals had religious beliefs, although the evidence is not unequivocal \u2013 while the dead were apparently buried deliberately, burrowing rodents could have introduced the flowers.\nSubstantial cross-cultural and historical research document funeral customs as a highly predictable, stable force in communities. Funeral customs tend to be characterized by five \"anchors\": significant symbols, gathered community, ritual action, cultural heritage, and transition of the dead body (corpse).\nReligious funerals.\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\nFunerals in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith are characterized by not embalming, a prohibition against cremation, using a chrysolite or hardwood casket, wrapping the body in silk or cotton, burial not farther than an hour (including flights) from the place of death, and placing a ring on the deceased's finger stating, \"I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\" The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed funeral service also contains the only prayer that is permitted to be read as a group \u2013 congregational prayer, although most of the prayer is read by one person in the gathering. The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed decedent often controls some aspects of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed funeral service, since leaving a will and testament is a requirement for Bah\u00e1'\u00eds. Since there are no Bah\u00e1'\u00ed clergy, services are usually conducted under the guise, or with the assistance of, a Local Spiritual Assembly.\nBuddhist.\nA Buddhist funeral marks the transition from one life to the next for the deceased. It also reminds the living of their own mortality. Cremation is the preferred choice, although burial is also allowed. Buddhists in Tibet perform sky burials where the body is exposed to be eaten by vultures. The body is dissected with a blade on the mountain top before the exposure. Crying and wailing is discouraged and the (body breakers who perform the ritual) laugh as if they are doing farm work. Tibetan Buddhists believe that a lighthearted atmosphere during the funeral helps the soul of the dead to get a better afterlife. After the vultures consume all the flesh the smash the bones into pieces and mix them with tsampa to feed to the vultures.\nChristian.\nCongregations of varied denominations perform different funeral ceremonies, but most involve offering prayers, scripture reading from the Bible, a sermon, homily, or eulogy, and music. One issue of concern as the 21st century began was with the use of secular music at Christian funerals, a custom generally forbidden by the Catholic Church.\nChristian burials have traditionally occurred on consecrated ground such as in churchyards. There are many funeral norms in Christianity. Burial, rather than a destructive process such as cremation, was the traditional practice amongst Christians, because of the belief in the resurrection of the body. Cremations later came into widespread use, although some denominations forbid them. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops said \"The Church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the deceased be observed; nevertheless, the Church does not prohibit cremation unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine\" (canon 1176.3).\nHindu.\nAntyesti, literally 'last rites' or 'last sacrifice', refers to the rite-of-passage rituals associated with a funeral in Hinduism. It is sometimes referred to as , or .\nA dead adult Hindu is cremated, while a dead child is typically buried. The rite of passage is said to be performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe. The soul (Atman, Brahman) is believed to be the immortal essence that is released at the ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements: air, water, fire, earth and space. The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins. The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of Rigveda in section 10.16, as follows:\nThe final rites of a burial, in case of untimely death of a child, is rooted in Rigveda's section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to \"neither harm our girls nor our boys\", and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.\nAmong Hindus, the dead body is usually cremated within a day of death. The body is washed, wrapped in white cloth for a man or a widow, red for a married woman, the two toes tied together with a string, a (red mark) placed on the forehead. The dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south. The eldest son, or a male mourner, or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function. He circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body, says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases, places sesame seed in the dead person's mouth, sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee (clarified butter), then draws three lines signifying (deity of the dead), (time, deity of cremation) and the dead. The pyre is then set ablaze, while the mourners mourn. The ash from the cremation is consecrated to the nearest river or sea. After the cremation, a period of mourning is observed for 10 to 12 days after which the immediate male relatives or the sons of the deceased shave their head, trim their nails, recites prayers with the help of priest or Brahmin and invite all relatives, kins, friends and neighbours to eat a simple meal together in remembrance of the deceased. This day, in some communities, also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead. In most Hindu communities the last day of the mourning is called as Terahveen (the thirteenth day), and on this day items of basic needs along with some favourite items of the deceased are donated to the priests. Also on the same day the eldest son of the family is ceremonially crowned (called \"Pagdi Rasm\") for he is now the head of the family. A feast is also organised for Brahmins,family members, and friends. \nZoroastrianism.\nThe belief that bodies are infested by Nasu upon death greatly influenced Zoroastrian burial ceremonies and funeral rites. Burial and cremation of corpses was prohibited, as such acts would defile the sacred creations of earth and fire respectively. Burial of corpses was so looked down upon that the exhumation of \"buried corpses was regarded as meritorious.\" For these reasons, \"Towers of Silence\" were developed\u2014open air, amphitheater like structures in which corpses were placed so carrion-eating birds could feed on them.\nSagd\u012bd, meaning 'seen by a dog,' is a ritual that must be performed as promptly after death as possible. The dog is able to calculate the degree of evil within the corpse, and entraps the contamination so it may not spread further, expelling Nasu from the body. Nasu remains within the corpse until it has been seen by a dog, or until it has been consumed by a dog or a carrion-eating bird. According to chapter 31 of the Denkard, the reasoning for the required consumption of corpses is that the evil influences of Nasu are contained within the corpse until, upon being digested, the body is changed from the form of nasa into nourishment for animals. The corpse is thereby delivered over to the animals, changing from the state of corrupted nasa to that of hixr, which is \"dry dead matter,\" considered to be less polluting.\nA path through which a funeral procession has traveled must not be passed again, as Nasu haunts the area thereafter, until the proper rites of banishment are performed. Nasu is expelled from the area only after \"a yellow dog with four eyes, or a white dog with yellow ears\" is walked through the path three times. If the dog goes unwillingly down the path, it must be walked back and forth up to nine times to ensure that Nasu has been driven off.\nZoroastrian ritual exposure of the dead is first known of from the writings of the mid-5th century BCE Herodotus, who observed the custom amongst Iranian expatriates in Asia Minor. In Herodotus' account (Histories i.140), the rites are said to have been \"secret\", but were first performed after the body had been dragged around by a bird or dog. The corpse was then embalmed with wax and laid in a trench.\nWhile the discovery of ossuaries in both eastern and western Iran dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BCE indicates that bones were isolated, that this separation occurred through ritual exposure cannot be assumed: burial mounds, where the bodies were wrapped in wax, have also been discovered. The tombs of the Achaemenid emperors at Naqsh-e Rustam and Pasargadae likewise suggest non-exposure, at least until the bones could be collected. According to legend (incorporated by Ferdowsi into his Shahnameh), Zoroaster is himself interred in a tomb at Balkh (in present-day Afghanistan).\nWriting on the culture of the Persians, Herodotus reports on the Persian burial customs performed by the Magi, which are kept secret. However, he writes that he knows they expose the body of male dead to dogs and birds of prey, then they cover the corpse in wax, and then it is buried. The Achaemenid custom is recorded for the dead in the regions of Bactria, Sogdia, and Hyrcania, but not in Western Iran.\nThe Byzantine historian Agathias has described the burial of the Sasanian general Mihr-Mihroe: \"the attendants of Mermeroes took up his body and removed it to a place outside the city and laid it there as it was, alone and uncovered according to their traditional custom, as refuse for dogs and horrible carrion\".\nTowers are a much later invention and are first documented in the early 9th century CE. The ritual customs surrounding that practice appear to date to the Sassanid era (3rd\u20137th century CE). They are known in detail from the supplement to the \"Sh\u0101yest n\u0113 Sh\u0101yest\", the two \"Revayats\" collections, and the two Saddars.\nIslamic.\nFunerals in Islam (called in Arabic) follow fairly specific rites. In all cases, however, sharia (Islamic religious law) calls for burial of the body, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by (prayer).\nBurial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include:\nThe mourning period is 40 days long.\nJewish.\nIn Judaism, funerals follow fairly specific rites, though they are subject to variation in custom. Halakha calls for preparatory rituals involving bathing and shrouding the body accompanied by prayers and readings from the Hebrew Bible, and then a funeral service marked by eulogies and brief prayers, and then the lowering of the body into the grave and the filling of the grave. Traditional law and practice forbid cremation of the body; the Reform Jewish movement generally discourages cremation but does not outright forbid it.\nBurial rites should normally take place as soon as possible and include:\nSikh.\nIn Sikhism death is not considered a natural process, an event that has absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of God's Will or Hukam. In Sikhism, birth and death are closely associated, as they are part of the cycle of human life of \"coming and going\" () which is seen as a transient stage towards Liberation (), understood as completely in unity with God. Sikhs believe in reincarnation.\nDeath is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life a Sikh is expected to constantly remember death so that they may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.\nThe public display of grief by wailing or crying out loud at the funeral (called ) is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum. Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, burial and burial at sea are also allowed if by necessity or by the will of the person. Markers such as gravestones, monuments, etc. are not allowed, because the body is considered to be just the shell and the person's soul is their real self.\nOn the day of the cremation, the body is washed and dressed and then taken to the Gurdwara or home where hymns (Shabadads) from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh Scriptures are recited by the congregation. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite \"Waheguru\" sitting near the coffin. This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an Ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site.\nAt the point of cremation, a few more Shabadads may be sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. The eldest son or a close relative generally lights the fire. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes. The ashes are later collected and disposed of by immersing them in a river, preferably one of the five rivers in the state of Punjab, India.\nThe ceremony in which the Sidharan Paath is begun after the cremation ceremony, may be held when convenient, wherever the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is present.\nHymns are sung from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji; the first five and final verses of \"Anand Sahib,\" the \"Song of Bliss,\" are recited or sung. The first five verses of Sikhism's morning prayer, \"Japji Sahib\", are read aloud to begin the Sidharan paath. A hukam, or random verse, is then read from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Ardas, a prayer, is offered, and Prashad, a sacred sweet, is distributed. Langar, a meal, is then served to guests.\nWhile the Sidharan paath is being read, the family may also sing hymns daily. Reading may take as long as needed to complete the paath.\nThis ceremony is followed by Sahaj Paath Bhog, Kirtan Sohila, night time prayer is recited for one week, and finally Ardas called the \"Antim Ardas\" (\"Final Prayer\") is offered the last week.\nCeltic.\nIt was custom for an officiant to walk in front of the coffin with a horse's skull; this tradition was still observed by Welsh peasants up until the 19th century.\nWestern funerals.\nClassical antiquity.\nAncient Greece.\nThe Greek word for funeral \u2013 \"k\u0113de\u00eda\" (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) \u2013 derives from the verb \"k\u0113domai\" (\u03ba\u03ae\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9), that means attend to, take care of someone. Derivative words are also \"k\u0113dem\u00f3n\" (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd, \"guardian\") and \"k\u0113demon\u00eda\" (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, \"guardianship\"). From the Cycladic civilization in 3000 BCE until the Hypo-Mycenaean era in 1200\u20131100 BCE the main practice of burial is interment. The cremation of the dead that appears around the 11th century BCE constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from the East. Until the Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area.\nThe ancient Greek funeral since the Homeric era included the \"pr\u00f3thesis\" (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), the \"ekphor\u00e1\" (\u1f10\u03ba\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac), the burial and the \"per\u00eddeipnon\" (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd). In most cases, this process is followed faithfully in Greece until today.\n\"Pr\u00f3thesis\" is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funeral bed and the threnody of his relatives. Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek tradition is the \"epicedium\", the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still.\n\"Ekphor\u00e1\" is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to \"go along with him\". In certain regions, coins to pay Charon, who ferries the dead to the underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed.\nThe Roman orator Cicero describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a custom that is maintained until today. After the ceremony, the mourners return to the house of the deceased for the \"per\u00eddeipnon\", the dinner after the burial. According to archaeological findings \u2013 traces of ash, bones of animals, shards of crockery, dishes and basins \u2013 the dinner during the classical era was also organized at the burial spot. Taking into consideration the written sources, however, the dinner could also be served in the houses.\nThe \"Necrodeipnon\" (\u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd) was the funeral banquet which was given at the house of the nearest relative.\nTwo days after the burial, a ceremony called \"the thirds\" was held. Eight days after the burial the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled at the burial spot, where \"the ninths\" would take place, a custom still kept. In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband.\n\"Nekysia\" (\u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1), meaning the day of the dead, and \"Genesia\" (\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1), meaning the day of the forefathers (ancestors), were yearly feasts in honour of the dead.\n\"Nemesia\" (\u039d\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1) or \"Nemeseia\" (N\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) was also a yearly feast in honour of the dead, most probably intended for averting the anger of the dead.\nAncient Rome.\nIn ancient Rome, the eldest surviving male of the household, the \"pater familias\", was summoned to the death-bed, where he attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent.\nFunerals of the socially prominent usually were undertaken by professional undertakers called \"libitinarii\". No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated. The surviving relations bore masks bearing the images of the family's deceased ancestors. The right to carry the masks in public eventually was restricted to families prominent enough to have held \"curule magistracies\". Mimes, dancers, and musicians hired by the undertakers, and professional female mourners, took part in these processions. Less well-to-do Romans could join benevolent funerary societies (\"collegia funeraticia\") that undertook these rites on their behalf.\nNine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or cremation, a feast was given (\"cena novendialis\") and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a \"columbarium\" (literally, \"dovecote\"). During this nine-day period, the house was considered to be tainted, \"funesta\", and was hung with Taxus baccata or Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death.\nSeveral Roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors, including the \"Parentalia\", held February 13 through 21, to honor the family's ancestors; and the Feast of the Lemures, held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which ghosts (\"larvae\") were feared to be active, and the \"pater familias\" sought to appease them with offerings of beans.\nThe Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city \"(pomerium)\", for both religious and civil reasons, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires.\nRestrictions on the length, ostentation, expense of, and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of lawmakers. Often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set. For instance, under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes.\nThe Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich usually were constructed of marble, the ground enclosed with walls, and planted around with trees. But common sepulchres usually were built below ground, and called hypogea. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called columbaria.\nNorth American funerals.\nWithin the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts: visitation, funeral, and the burial service. A home funeral (services prepared and conducted by the family, with little or no involvement from professionals) is legal in nearly every part of North America, but in the 21st century, they are uncommon in the US.\nVisitation.\nAt the \"visitation\" (also called a \"viewing\", \"wake\" or \"calling hours\"), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets). The viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent's home or that of a relative for viewing. This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes. In recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in \u2013 some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces, brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased prior to burial or be buried with the deceased. Jewelry has to be removed before cremation in order to prevent damage to the crematory. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial.\nThe most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended. In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show \"happy times\"), prized possessions and other items representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments. A more recent trend is to create a DVD with pictures and video of the deceased, accompanied by music, and play this DVD continuously during the visitation.\nThe viewing is either \"open casket\", in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display; or \"closed casket\", in which the coffin is closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness, if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse, or if the deceased did not wish to be viewed. In cases such as these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the casket.\nHowever, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed. Torah law forbids embalming. Traditionally flowers (and music) are not sent to a grieving Jewish family as it is a reminder of the life that is now lost. The Jewish shiva tradition discourages family members from cooking, so food is brought by friends and neighbors. (\"See also Jewish bereavement.\")\nThe decedent's closest friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the viewing, with the exception of a Jewish funeral, where flowers would not be appropriate (donations are often given to a charity instead).\nObituaries sometimes contain a request that attendees do not send flowers (e.g. \"In lieu of flowers\"). The use of these phrases has been on the rise for the past century. In the US in 1927, only 6% of the obituaries included the directive, with only 2% of those mentioned charitable contributions instead. By the middle of the century, they had grown to 15%, with over 54% of those noting a charitable contribution as the preferred method of expressing sympathy.\nFuneral.\nThe deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cort\u00e8ge), with the hearse, funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions \u2013 such as requiring most other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs. After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there. If the deceased is to be cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium.\nFuneral customs vary from country to country. In the United States, any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is considered disrespectful.\nA burial tends to cost more than a cremation.\nBurial service.\nAt a religious burial service, conducted at the side of the grave, tomb, mausoleum or cremation, the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion.\nSometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a funeral procession travels from the site of the funeral to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time, when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of winter.\nIf the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, military rites are often accorded at the burial service.\nIn many religious traditions, pallbearers, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service.\nMost religions expect coffins to be kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells. Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it.\nMorticians may ensure that all jewelry, including wristwatch, that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed. Custom requires that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish services. Jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased.\nIn the case of cremation such items are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation \u2013 if left in they could explode.\nIndigenous Americans.\nFunerals for indigenous people, like many other cultures, are a method to remember, commemorate and respect the dead through their own cultural practices and traditions.\nCalifornia.\nIn the past, there has been scrutiny when the topic of indigenous funeral sites was approached. Thus the federal government deemed it necessary to include a series of acts that would protect and accurately affiliate some of these burials with their correct native individuals or groups. This was enacted through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Furthermore, in 2001 California created the California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act that would \"require all state agencies and museums that receive state funding and that have possession or control over collections of humans remains or cultural items to provide a process for identification and repatriates of these items to appropriate tribes.\" In 2020, it was amended to include tribes that were beyond State and Federal knowledge.\nWestern Yuman region.\nIn the Ipai, Tipai, Paipai, and Kiliwa regions funeral practices are similar in their social and power dynamics. The way that these funeral sites were created was based on previous habitation. Meaning, these were sites were their peoples may have died or if they had been a temporary home for some of these groups. Additionally, these individual burials were characterized by grave markers and/or grave offerings. The markers included inverted metates, fractured pieces of metates as well as cairns. As for offerings, food, shell and stone beads were often found in burial mounds along with portions human remains.\nThe state of the human remains found at the site can vary, data suggests that cremations are recent in prehistory compared to just burials. Ranging from the middle Holocene era to the Late Prehistoric Period. Additionally, the position these people were placed in plays a role in how the afterlife was viewed. With recent ethnographic evidence coming from the Yuman people, it is believed that the spirits of the dead could potentially harm the living. so, they would often layer the markers or offerings above the body so that they would be unable to \"leave\" their graves and enact harm.\nTongva.\nIn the Los Angeles Basin, researchers discovered communal mourning features at West Bluffs and Landing Hill. These communal mourning rituals were estimated to have taken place during the Intermediate Period (3,000-1,000 B.P.). Archaeologists have found fragmented pieces of a large schist pestle which was deliberately broken in a methodical way. Other fragmented vessels show signs of uneven burning on the interior surface presumed to have been caused by burning combustible material.\nIn the West Bluffs and Landing Hill assemblages there are many instances of artifacts that were dyed in red ochre pigment after being broken. The tradition of intentionally breaking objects has been a custom in the region for thousands of years for the purpose of releasing the spirit within the object, reducing harm to the community, or as an expression of grief. Pigmentation of grave goods also has many interpretations, the Chumash associate the color red with both earth and fire. While some researchers consider the usage of the red pigment as an important transitional moment in the adult life cycle.\nMemorial services.\nA memorial service is one given for the deceased, often without the body present. The service takes place \"after\" cremation or burial at sea, after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, or after the ashes have been scattered. It is also significant when the person is missing and presumed dead, or known to be deceased though the body is not recoverable. These services often take place at a funeral home; however, they can be held in a home, university, town hall, workplace, church or other location of some significance. A memorial service may include speeches (eulogies), prayers, poems, or songs to commemorate the deceased. Pictures of the deceased and flowers are usually placed where the coffin would normally be placed.\nAfter the sudden deaths of important public officials, public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial services were held after the assassinations of US presidents James A. Garfield and William McKinley.\nEuropean funerals.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, funerals are commonly held at a church, crematorium or cemetery chapel. Historically, it was customary to bury the dead, but since the 1960s, cremation has been more common.\nWhile there is no visitation ceremony like in North America, relatives may view the body beforehand at the funeral home. A room for viewing is usually called a \"chapel of rest\". Funerals typically last about half an hour. They are sometimes split into two ceremonies: a main funeral and a shorter \"committal\" ceremony. In the latter, the coffin is either handed over to a crematorium or buried in a cemetery. This allows the funeral to be held at a place without cremation or burial facilities. Alternatively, the entire funeral may be held in the chapel of the crematorium or cemetery. It is not customary to view a cremation; instead, the coffin may be removed from the chapel or hidden with curtains towards the end of the funeral.\nAfter the funeral, it is common for the mourners to gather for refreshments. This is sometimes called a wake, though this is different from how the term is used in other countries, where a wake is a ceremony before the funeral.\nFinland.\nIn Finland, religious funerals (\"hautajaiset\") are quite ascetic and typically follow Lutheran traditions. The local priest or minister says prayers and blesses the deceased in their house. The mourners (\"saattov\u00e4ki\") traditionally bring food to the mourners' house. Common current practice has the deceased placed into the coffin in the place where they died. The undertaker will pick up the coffin and place it in the hearse and drive it to the funeral home, while the closest relatives or friends of the deceased will follow the hearse in a funeral procession in their own cars. The coffin will be held at the funeral home until the day of the funeral. The funeral services may be divided into two parts. First is the church service (\"siunaustilaisuus\") in a cemetery chapel or local church, then the burial.\nItaly.\nThe majority of Italians are Roman Catholic and follow Catholic funeral traditions. Historically, mourners would walk in a funeral procession to the gravesite; today vehicles are used.\nGreece.\nGreek funerals are generally held in churches, including a Trisagion service. There is usually a 40-day mourning period, and the end of which, a memorial service is held. Every year following, a similar service takes place, to mark the anniversary of the death.\nPoland.\nIn Poland, in urban areas, there are usually two, or just one \"stop\". The body, brought by a hearse from the mortuary, may be taken to a church or to a cemetery chapel. There is then a funeral mass or service at the cemetery chapel. Following the mass or Service the casket is carried in procession (usually on foot) by hearse to the grave. Once at the grave-site, the priest will commence the graveside committal service and the casket is lowered. The mass or service usually takes place at the cemetery.\nIn some traditional rural areas, the wake (\"czuwanie\") takes place in the house of the deceased or their relatives. The body lies in state for three days in the house. The funeral usually takes place on the third day. Family, neighbors and friends gather and pray during the day and night on those three days and nights. There are usually three stages in the funeral ceremony (\"ceremonia pogrzebowa\", \"pogrzeb\"): the wake (\"czuwanie\"), then the body is carried by procession (usually on foot) or people drive in their own cars to the church or cemetery chapel for mass, and another procession by foot to the gravesite.\nAfter the funeral, families gather for a post-funeral get-together (\"stypa\"). It can be at the family home, or at a function hall. In Poland cremation is less popular because the Catholic Church in Poland prefers traditional burials (though cremation is allowed). Cremation is more popular among non-religious people and Protestants in Poland.\nScotland.\nAn old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands involved burying the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. On the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as \"earth laid upon a corpse\". This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse.\nSpain.\nIn Spain, a burial or cremation may occur very soon after a death. Most Spaniards are Roman Catholics and follow Catholic funeral traditions. First, family and friends sit with the deceased during the wake until the burial. Wakes are a social event and a time to laugh and honor the dead. Following the wake comes the funeral mass (Tanatorio) at the church or cemetery chapel. Following the mass is the burial. The coffin is then moved from the church to the local cemetery, often with a procession of locals walking behind the hearse.\nSweden.\nThe first Swedish evangelical order of burial was given in Olaus Petri's handbook of 1529. From the medieval order, it had only kept burial and cremation. The funeral where the priest blessed the recently deceased, which after the Reformation came to be called a reading, was forbidden in the church order of 1686, but was taken over by lay people instead. It was then followed by the wake, which was banned by the church law in 1686, when it was often considered degenerate to do dancing and games where beer and brandy were served. It came however, to live on in the custom of \"singing out corpses\". In older times, the grave was often shoveled closed during the hymn singing. During the 17th century, homilies became common, they were later replaced by grift speeches, which, however, never became mandatory. In 1686, it was decided that those who had lived a Christian life should be \"honestly and properly buried in a grave\". It also determined that the burial would be performed by a priest in the Church of Sweden (later some religious communities were given the right to bury their dead themselves). Burial could only take place at a burial site intended for the purpose. Loss of honorable burial became a punishment. A distinction was made between silent burial (for some serious criminals) and quiet burial without singing and bell ringing and with abbreviated ritual (for some criminals, unbaptized children and for those who committed suicide). Church burial was compulsory for members of the Church of Sweden until 1926, when the possibility was opened for civil burial.\nWales.\nTraditionally, a good funeral (as they were called) had one draw the curtains for a period of time; at the wake, when new visitors arrived, they would enter from the front door and leave through the back door. The women stayed at home whilst the men attended the funeral, the village priest would then visit the family at their home to talk about the deceased and to console them.\nThe first child of William Price, a Welsh Neo-Druidic priest, died in 1884. Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, and thereby pollute the earth, Price decided to cremate his son's body, a practice which had been common in Celtic societies.\nThe police arrested him for the illegal disposal of a corpse. Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that, together with the activities of the newly founded Cremation Society of Great Britain, led to the \"Cremation Act 1902\". The Act imposed procedural requirements before a cremation could occur and restricted the practice to authorised places.\nOther types of funerals.\nCelebration of life.\nA growing number of families choose to hold a life celebration or celebration of life event for the deceased in addition to or instead of a traditional funeral. A coffin would remain closed during this ceremony. Unlike funerals, the focus of the ceremony is on the life that was lived. Such ceremonies may be held outside the funeral home or place of worship; restaurants, parks, pubs and sporting facilities are popular choices based on the specific interests of the deceased. Celebrations of life focus on a life that was lived, including the person's best qualities, interests, achievements and impact, rather than mourning a death. Some events are portrayed as joyous parties, instead of a traditional somber funeral. Taking on happy and hopeful tones, celebrations of life discourage wearing black and focus on the deceased's individuality. An extreme example might have \"a fully stocked open bar, catered food, and even favors.\" Notable recent celebrations of life ceremonies include those for Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil and Maya Angelou.\nJazz funeral.\nOriginating in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., alongside the emergence of jazz music in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the jazz funeral is a traditionally African-American burial ceremony and celebration of life unique to New Orleans that involves a parading funeral procession accompanied by a brass band playing somber hymns followed by upbeat jazz music. Traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director, family, friends, and the brass band, i.e., the \"main line\", who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow dirges and Christian hymns. After the body is buried, or \"cut loose\", the band begins to play up-tempo, joyful jazz numbers, as the main line parades through the streets and crowds of \"second liners\" join in and begin dancing and marching along, transforming the funeral into a street festival.\nGreen.\nThe terms \"green burial\" and \"natural burial\", used interchangeably, apply to ceremonies that aim to return the body with the earth with little to no use of artificial, non-biodegradable materials. As a concept, the idea of uniting an individual with the natural world after they die appears as old as human death itself, being widespread before the rise of the funeral industry. Holding environmentally-friendly ceremonies as a modern concept first attracted widespread attention in the 1990s. In terms of North America, the opening of the first explicitly \"green\" burial cemetery in the U.S. took place in the state of South Carolina. However, the Green Burial Council, which came into being in 2005, has based its operations out of California. The institution works to officially certify burial practices for funeral homes and cemeteries, making sure that appropriate materials are used.\nReligiously, some adherents of the Roman Catholic Church often have particular interest in \"green\" funerals given the faith's preference to full burial of the body as well as the theological commitments to care for the environment stated in Catholic social teaching.\nThose with concerns about the effects on the environment of traditional burial or cremation may be placed into a natural bio-degradable green burial shroud. That, in turn, sometimes gets placed into a simple coffin made of cardboard or other easily biodegradable material. Furthermore, individuals may choose their final resting place to be in a specially designed park or woodland, sometimes known as an \"ecocemetery\", and may have a tree or other item of greenery planted over their grave both as a contribution to the environment and a symbol of remembrance.\nHumanist and otherwise not religiously affiliated.\nHumanists UK organises a network of humanist funeral celebrants or officiants across England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands and a similar network is organised by the Humanist Society Scotland. Humanist officiants are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable ceremonies for non-religious individuals. Humanist funerals recognise no \"afterlife\", but celebrate the life of the person who has died. In the twenty-first century, humanist funerals were held for well-known people including Claire Rayner, Keith Floyd, Linda Smith, and Ronnie Barker.\nIn areas outside of the United Kingdom, Ireland has featured an increasing number of non-religious funeral arrangements according to publications such as \"Dublin Live\". This has occurred in parallel with a trend of increasing numbers of people carefully scripting their own funerals before they die, writing the details of their own ceremonies. The Irish Association of Funeral Directors has reported that funerals without a religious focus occur mainly in more urbanized areas in contrast to rural territories. Notably, humanist funerals have started to become more prominent in other nations such as the Republic of Malta, in which civil rights activist and humanist Ramon Casha had a large scale event at the Radisson Blu Golden Sands resort devoted to laying him to rest. Although such non-religious ceremonies are \"a rare scene in Maltese society\" due to the large role of the Roman Catholic Church within that country's culture, according to \"Lovin Malta\", \"more and more Maltese people want to know about alternative forms of burial... without any religion being involved\".\nActual events during non-religious funerals vary, but they frequently reflect upon the interests and personality of the deceased. For example, the humanist ceremony for the aforementioned Keith Floyd, a restaurateur and television personality, included a reading of Rudyard Kipling's poetic work \"If\u2014\" and a performance by musician Bill Padley. Organizations such as the Irish Institute of Celebrants have stated that more and more regular individuals request training for administering funeral ceremonies, instead of leaving things to other individuals.\nMore recently, some commercial organisations offer \"civil funerals\" that can integrate traditionally religious content.\nPolice/fire services.\nFunerals specifically for fallen members of fire or police services are common in United States and Canada. These funerals involve honour guards from police forces and/or fire services from across the country and sometimes from overseas. A parade of officers often precedes or follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade. A traditional fire department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders. The firefighters travel under the aerials on their ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero's funeral. Also a \"Last Alarm Bell\" is rung. A portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony.\nMasonic.\nA Masonic funeral is held at the request of a departed Mason or family member. The service may be held in any of the usual places or a Lodge room with committal at graveside, or the complete service can be performed at any of the aforementioned places without a separate committal. Freemasonry does not require a Masonic funeral.\nThere is no single convention for a Masonic funeral service. Some Grand Lodges have a prescribed service (as it is a worldwide organisation). Some of the customs include the presiding officer wearing a hat while doing his part in the service, the Lodge members placing sprigs of evergreen on the casket, and a small white leather apron may being placed in or on the casket. The hat may be worn because it is Masonic custom (in some places in the world) for the presiding officer to have his head covered while officiating. To Masons, the sprig of evergreen is a symbol of immortality. A Mason wears a white leather apron, called a \"lambskin\", on becoming a Mason, and he may continue to wear it even in death.\nAsian funerals.\nIn most East Asian, South Asian and many Southeast Asian cultures, the wearing of white is symbolic of death. In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony. In Chinese culture, red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness. Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached an advanced age such as 85, in which case the funeral is considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable. Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe.\nContemporary South Korean funerals typically mix western culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave. The ashes of the cremated corpse are commonly stored in columbaria.\nIn Japan.\nMost Japanese funerals are conducted with Buddhist and/or Shinto rites. Many ritually bestow a new name on the deceased; funerary names typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words, to avoid the likelihood of the name being used in ordinary speech or writing. The new names are typically chosen by a Buddhist priest, after consulting the family of the deceased.\nReligious thought among the Japanese people is generally a blend of Shint\u014d and Buddhist beliefs. In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual's passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90% Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner[?]. Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death.\nAccording to an estimate in 2005, 99% of all deceased Japanese are cremated. In most cases the cremated remains are placed in an urn and then deposited in a family grave. In recent years however, alternative methods of disposal have become more popular, including scattering of the ashes, burial in outer space, and conversion of the cremated remains into a diamond that can be set in jewelry.\nIn the Philippines.\nFuneral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of personal, cultural, and traditional beliefs and practices which Filipinos observe in relation to death, bereavement, and the proper honoring, interment, and remembrance of the dead. These practices have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex history.\nMost if not all present-day Filipinos, like their ancestors, believe in some form of an afterlife and give considerable attention to honouring the dead. Except amongst Filipino Muslims (who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death), a wake is generally held from three days to a week. Wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home, while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home. Friends and neighbors bring food to the family, such as \"pancit\" noodles and \"bibingka\" cake\";\" any leftovers are never taken home by guests, because of a superstition against it. Apart from spreading the news about someone's death verbally, obituaries are also published in newspapers. Although the majority of the Filipino people are Christians, they have retained some traditional indigenous beliefs concerning death.\nIn Korea.\nIn Korea, funerals are typically held for three days and different things are done in each day.\nThe first day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. They prepare clothes for the body and put them into a chapel of rest. Then food is prepared for the deceased. It is made up of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dishes. Also, there has to be three coins and three straw shoes. This can be cancelled if the family of the dead person have a particular religion.\nOn the second day the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done. Then, a family member of the dead person puts uncooked rice in the mouth of the body. This step does not have to be done if the family has a certain religion. After putting the rice in the mouth, the body is moved into a coffin. Family members, including close relatives, of the dead person will wear mourning clothing. Typically, mourning for a woman includes Korean traditional clothes, Hanbok, and mourning for man includes a suit. The color has to be black. The ritual ceremony begins when they are done with changing clothes and preparing foods for the dead person. The ritual ceremony is different depending on their religion. After the ritual ceremony family members will start to greet guests.\nOn the third day, the family decides whether to bury the body in the ground or cremate the body. In the case of burial, three family members sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. In the case of cremation, there is no specific ritual; the only requirement is a jar to store burned bones and a place to keep the jar.\nOther than these facts, in Korea, people who come to the funeral bring condolence money. Also, a food called Yukgaejang is served to guests, oftentimes with the Korean distilled drink called soju.\nIn Mongolia.\nIn Mongolia, like many other cultures, funeral practices are the most important rituals that they follow. They have mixed their rituals with Buddhists due to creating a new, unique way of death.\nFor Mongolians who are very strict about tradition, families choose from three different ways of burial: open-air burial which is most common, cremation, and embalming. Many factors go into deciding which funeral practice to do. These consisted of the family's social standing, the cause of death, and the place of death. Embalming was mainly chosen by members of the Lamaistic Church; by choosing this practice, they are usually buried in a sitting position. This would show that they would always be in the position of prayer. Also, more important people such as nobles would be buried with weapons, horses and food in their coffins to help them prepare for the next world.\nThe coffin is designed and built by three to four relatives, mainly men. The builders bring planks to the hut where the dead is located and put together the box and the lid. The same people who build the coffin also decorate the funeral. Most of this work is done after dusk. With specific instruction, they work on decorations inside the youngest daughter's house. The reason for this is so the deceased is not disturbed at night.\nIn Vietnam.\nIn Vietnam, Buddhism is the most commonly practiced religion, however, most burial methods do not coincide with the Buddhist belief of cremation.\nThe body of the deceased is moved to a loved one's house and placed in an expensive coffin. The body usually stays there for about three days, allowing time for people to visit and place gifts in the mouth. This stems from the Vietnamese belief that the dead should be surrounded by their family. This belief goes so far as to include superstition as well. If somebody is dying in Vietnamese culture, they are rushed home from the hospital so they can die there, because if they die away from home it is believed to be bad luck to take a corpse home.\nMany services are also held in the Vietnamese burial practices. One is held before moving the coffin from the home and the other is held at the burial site. After the burial of the loved one, incense is burned at the gravesite and respect is paid to all the nearby graves. Following this, the family and friends return to the home and enjoy a feast to celebrate the life of the recently departed. Even after the deceased has been buried, the respect and honor continues. For the first 49 days after the burying, the family holds a memorial service every 7 days, where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life of their loved one. After this, they meet again on the 100th day after the death, then 265 days after the death, and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death of their loved one, a whole year later, to continue to celebrate the glorious life of their recently departed.\nThe Vietnamese funeral, or \u0111\u00e1m gi\u1ed7, is a less somber occasion than most traditional Western funerals. The \u0111\u00e1m gi\u1ed7 is a celebration of the deceased's life and is centered around the deceased's family.\nFamily members might wear a traditional garment called a mourning headband to signify their relationship with the deceased. Typical mourning headbands are thin strips of fabric that are wrapped around the wearer's head. Traditionally, the deceased's closest family members, such as children, siblings, spouses, and parents will wear white mourning headbands. More distant family members' headband colors may vary. In some cultures, the deceased's nieces, nephews, or grandchildren may be required to wear white headbands with red dots. Other societies may encourage grandchildren to wear white headbands with blue dots. Fourth generation grandchildren often wear yellow mourning headbands.\nThe use of mourning headbands emphasizes the importance of personal and familial roles in Vietnamese society. It also allows funeral attendants to carefully choose their interactions and offer condolences to those closest to the deceased.\nTraditionally, attendants of a Vietnamese funeral service are encouraged to wear the color white. In many East Asian cultures, white is viewed as a sign of loss and mourning. In Vietnam, members of the Caodaist faith believe that white represents purity and the ability to communicate beyond spiritual worlds.\nAfrican funerals.\nWest African.\nAfrican funerals are usually open to many visitors. The custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses has been to some degree prevalent on the Gold Coast of Africa. The ceremony depends on the traditions of the ethnicity the deceased belonged to. The funeral may last for as much as a week. Another custom, a kind of memorial, frequently takes place seven years after the person's death. These funerals and especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question. Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, may be offered and then consumed.\nThe Ashanti and Akan ethnic groups in Ghana typically wear red and black during funerals. For special family members, there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased. Afterwards, the Akan hold a sombre funeral procession and burial with intense displays of sorrow. Other funerals in Ghana are held with the deceased put in elaborate Fantasy coffins colored and shaped after a certain object, such as a fish, crab, boat, and even airplanes. The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop in Teshie, named after Seth Kane Kwei who invented this new style of coffin, has become an international reference for this form of art.\nEast African.\nEvidence of Africa's earliest funeral was found in Kenya in 2021. A 78,000 year old Middle Stone Age grave of a three-year-old child was discovered in Panga ya Saidi cave complex, Kenya. Researchers said the child's head appeared to have been laid on a pillow. The body had been laid in a fetal position.\nIn Kenya funerals are an expensive undertaking. Keeping bodies in morgues to allow for fund raising is a common occurrence more so in urban areas. Some families opt to bury their dead in the countryside homes instead of urban cemeteries, thus spending more money on transporting the dead.\nHistorical mausoleums.\nChina.\nMausoleum of the First Qin Emperor.\nThe first emperor of the Qin dynasty, Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum is located in the Lintong District of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. Qin Shi Huang's tomb is one of the World Heritage sites in China. Its remarkable feature and size have been known as one of the most important historical sites in China. Qin Shi Huang is the first emperor who united China for the first time. The mausoleum was built in 247 BCE after he became the emperor of the Qin dynasty.\nAncient Chinese mausoleums have unique characteristics compared to other cultures[citation?]. Ancient Chinese thought that the soul remains even after death, (immortal soul) regarded funeral practices as an important tradition. From their long history, the construction of mausoleums has developed over time, creating monumental and massive ancient emperor's tomb.\nArcheologists have found more than 8,000 life-sized figures resembling an army surrounding the emperor's tomb. The primary purpose of the placement of Terracotta Army is to protect the emperor's tomb. The figures were composed of clay and fragments of pottery. The Terracotta Army represents soldiers, horses, government officials, and even musicians. The arrangement and the weapons they are carrying accurately represent the real formations and weapons of the time. Furthermore, facial features aren't identical, each sculpture bearing a unique look.\nImperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.\nThe Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties are included as World Heritage Sites. The three Imperial Tombs of the Qin dynasty were added in 2000 and 2003. The three tombs were all built in the 17th century. The tombs have been constructed to memorialize the emperors of the Qing dynasty and their ancestors. In tradition, Chinese have followed Feng Shui to build and decorate the interior. All of the tombs are strictly made following the superstition of Feng Shui.\nThe Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties clearly show the cultural and architectural tradition that has existed in the area for more than 500 years[citation?]. In Chinese culture, the tombs were considered as a portal between the world of the living and the dead[citation?]. Chinese believed that the portal would divide the soul into two parts. The half of the soul would go to heaven, and the other half would remain within the physical body.\nMutes and professional mourners.\nFrom about 1600 to 1914 Europe had two professions that have almost entirely disappeared. The mute appears in art quite frequently, but in literature is probably best known from Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\" (1837\u20131839). Oliver is working for Mr Sowerberry when characterised thus: \"There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear... which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love.\" And in \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" (1842\u20131844), Moult, the undertaker, states: \"This promises to be one of the most impressive funerals...no limitation of expense...I have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes, and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff\".\nThe main function of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves.\nThe professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep. Records document forms of professional mourning from Ancient Greece. The 2003 award-winning Philippine comedy \"Crying Ladies\" revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in Manila's Chinatown. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well-loved by many.\nState funeral.\nHigh-ranking national figures such as heads of state, prominent politicians, military figures, national heroes and eminent cultural figures may be offered state funerals.\nFinal disposition.\nCommon methods of disposal are:\nSelf-planned funerals.\nSome people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent's remains (including funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes; in other states, the law allows the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account.\nThe decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to the funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out, with alternative gifts if they are not followed. This requires the will to become available in time; aspects of the disposition of the remains of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which were found in a safe that was not opened until after the funeral.\nOrgan donation and body donation.\nSome people donate their bodies to a medical school for use in research or education. Medical students frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research. Some medical conditions, such as amputations or various surgeries can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes; in other cases the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. Many medical schools rely on the donation of cadavers for the teaching of anatomy. It is also possible to arrange for donate organs and tissue after death for treating the sick, or even whole cadavers for forensic research at body farms."}

{"id": "11185", "revid": "23471211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11185", "title": "Feminism", "text": "Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism holds the position that modern societies are patriarchal\u2014they prioritize the male point of view\u2014and that women are treated unjustly in these societies. Efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes and improving educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women.\nOriginating in late 18th-century Europe, feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to vote, run for public office, work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter into contracts, have equal rights within marriage, and maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception, legal abortions, and social integration; and to protect women and girls from sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for women have also been part of feminist movements.\nMany scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender-neutral language, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles. Feminist theory, which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experiences. Feminist theorists have developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.\nNumerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years, representing different viewpoints and political aims. Traditionally, since the 19th century, first-wave liberal feminism, which sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework, was contrasted with labour-based proletarian women's movements that over time developed into socialist and Marxist feminism based on class struggle theory. Since the 1960s, both of these traditions are also contrasted with the radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate patriarchy. Liberal, socialist, and radical feminism are sometimes referred to as the \"Big Three\" schools of feminist thought.\nSince the late 20th century, many newer forms of feminism have emerged. Some forms, such as white feminism and gender-critical feminism, have been criticized as taking into account only white, middle class, college-educated, heterosexual, or cisgender perspectives. These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, such as black feminism and intersectional feminism.\nHistory.\nTerminology.\nMary Wollstonecraft is seen by many as a founder of feminism due to her 1792 book titled \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" in which she argues that class and private property are the basis of discrimination against women, and that women as much as men needed equal rights. Charles Fourier, a utopian socialist and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word \"f\u00e9minisme\" in 1837, but no trace of the word have been found in his works. The word \"f\u00e9minisme\" (\"feminism\") first appeared in France in 1871 in a medicine thesis about men suffering from tuberculosis and having developed, according to the author Ferdinand-Val\u00e8re Faneau de la Cour, feminine traits. The word \"f\u00e9ministe\" (\"feminist\"), inspired by its medical use, was coined by Alexandre Dumas fils in a 1872 essay, referring to men who supported women rights. In both cases, the use of the word was very negative and reflected a criticism of a so-called \"confusion of the sexes\" by women who refused to abide by the sexual division of society and challenged the inequalities between sexes.\nThe concepts appeared in the Netherlands in 1872, Great Britain in the 1890s, and the United States in 1910. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" dates the first appearance in English in this meaning back to 1895. Depending on the historical moment, culture and country, feminists around the world have had different causes and goals. Most western feminist historians contend that all movements working to obtain women's rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves. Other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants. Those historians use the label \"protofeminist\" to describe earlier movements.\nWaves.\nThe history of the modern western feminist movement is divided into multiple \"waves\". The first comprised women's suffrage movements of the 19th and early-20th centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The second wave, the women's liberation movement, began in the 1960s and campaigned for legal and social equality for women. In or around 1992, a third wave was identified, characterized by a focus on individuality and diversity. Additionally, some have argued for the existence of a fourth wave, starting around 2012, which has used social media to combat sexual harassment, violence against women and rape culture; it is best known for the Me Too movement.\n19th and early 20th centuries.\nFirst-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th and early-20th centuries. In the UK and US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. New legislation included the Custody of Infants Act 1839 in the UK, which introduced the tender years doctrine for child custody and gave women the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation, such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, became models for similar legislation in other British territories. Victoria passed legislation in 1884 and New South Wales in 1889; the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. With the turn of the 19th century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights too.\nWomen's suffrage (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's Australasian colonies at the end of the 19th century, with the self-governing colony of New Zealand granting women the right to vote in 1893; South Australia followed suit with the Constitutional Amendment (Adult Suffrage) Act 1894 in 1894. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.\nIn Britain, the suffragettes and suffragists campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the Representation of the People Act was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property. In 1928, this was extended to all women over 21. Emmeline Pankhurst was the most notable activist in England. \"Time\" named her one of the , stating: \"she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back.\" In the US, notable leaders of this movement included Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery before championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the Quaker theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God. They were also influenced by earlier American feminist thought leaders Judith Sargent Murray, John Neal, Sarah Moore Grimk\u00e9, and Margaret Fuller. In the US, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states. The term \"first wave\" was coined retroactively when the term \"second-wave feminism\" came into use.\nIn Germany, feminists like Clara Zetkin was very interested in women's politics, including the fight for equal opportunities and women's suffrage, through socialism. She helped to develop the social-democratic women's movement in Germany. From 1891 to 1917, she edited the SPD women's newspaper \"Die Gleichheit\" (Equality). In 1907 she became the leader of the newly founded \"Women's Office\" at the SPD. She also contributed to International Women's Day (IWD).\nDuring the late Qing period and reform movements such as the Hundred Days' Reform, Chinese feminists called for women's liberation from traditional roles and Neo-Confucian gender segregation. Later, the Chinese Communist Party created projects aimed at integrating women into the workforce, and claimed that the revolution had successfully achieved women's liberation.\nAccording to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with Arab nationalism. In 1899, Qasim Amin, considered the \"father\" of Arab feminism, wrote \"The Liberation of Women\", which argued for legal and social reforms for women. He drew links between women's position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement. In 1923 Hoda Shaarawi founded the Egyptian Feminist Union, became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement.\nThe Iranian Constitutional Revolution in 1905 triggered the Iranian women's movement, which aimed to achieve women's equality in education, marriage, careers, and legal rights. However, during the Iranian revolution of 1979, many of the rights that women had gained from the women's movement were systematically abolished, such as the Family Protection Law.\nMid-20th century.\nBy the mid-20th century, women still lacked significant rights. In France, women obtained the right to vote only with the Provisional Government of the French Republic of 21 April 1944. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by Fernard Grenier, they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the November 1946 elections, the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the \"gender gap\", stating in \"Le Populaire\" that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the baby boom period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.\nIn Switzerland, women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.\nFeminists continued to campaign for the reform of family laws which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century coverture had been abolished in the UK and US, married women in many continental European countries still had very few rights. For instance, in France, married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965. Feminists have also worked to abolish the \"marital exemption\" in rape laws which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives. Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as Voltairine de Cleyre, Victoria Woodhull and Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme-Elmy to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.\nFrench philosopher Simone de Beauvoir provided a Marxist solution and an existentialist view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of \"The Second Sex\" in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination. \nSecond-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author Carol Hanisch coined the slogan \"The Personal is Political\", which became synonymous with the second wave.\nSecond- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.\nIn 1956, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt initiated \"state feminism\", which outlawed discrimination based on gender and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders. During Sadat's presidency, his wife, Jehan Sadat, publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new Islamist movement and growing conservatism. However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, Islamic feminism, which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.\nIn Latin America, revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as Nicaragua, where feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.\nIn 1963, Betty Friedan's book \"The Feminine Mystique\" helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States. Within ten years, women made up over half the First World workforce. In 1970, Australian writer Germaine Greer published \"The Female Eunuch\", which became a worldwide bestseller, reportedly driving up divorce rates.\nLate 20th and early 21st centuries.\nThird-wave feminism.\nThird-wave feminism is traced to the emergence of the riot grrrl feminist punk subculture in Olympia, Washington, in the early 1990s, and to Anita Hill's televised testimony in 1991\u2014to an all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee\u2014that Clarence Thomas, nominated for the Supreme Court of the United States, had sexually harassed her. The term \"third wave\" is credited to Rebecca Walker, who responded to Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in \"Ms.\" magazine, \"Becoming the Third Wave\" (1992). She wrote:\nThird-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's essentialist definitions of femininity, which, third-wave feminists argued, overemphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on \"micro-politics\" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as Gloria Anzald\u00faa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherr\u00ede Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities. Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between difference feminists, who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to social conditioning.\nStandpoint theory.\nStandpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view stating that a person's social position influences their knowledge. This perspective argues that research and theory treat women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased. Since the 1980s, standpoint feminists have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues (such as rape, incest, and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as female genital mutilation in some parts of Africa and Arab societies, as well as glass ceiling practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, homophobia, classism, and colonization in a \"matrix of domination\".\nFourth-wave feminism.\nFourth-wave feminism is a proposed extension of third-wave feminism which corresponds to a resurgence in interest in feminism beginning around 2012 and associated with the use of social media. According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to sexual harassment and violence against women. Its essence, she writes, is \"incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist\".\nFourth-wave feminism is \"defined by technology\", according to Kira Cochrane, and is characterized particularly by the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, and blogs such as Feministing to challenge misogyny and further gender equality.\nIssues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include street and workplace harassment, campus sexual assault, and rape culture. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the 2012 Delhi gang rape, 2012 Jimmy Savile allegations, the Bill Cosby allegations, 2014 Isla Vista killings, 2016 trial of Jian Ghomeshi, 2017 Harvey Weinstein allegations, and subsequent Weinstein effect, and the 2017 Westminster sexual scandals.\nExamples of fourth-wave feminist campaigns include the Everyday Sexism Project, No More Page 3, Stop Bild Sexism, \"Mattress Performance\", \"10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman\", #YesAllWomen, Free the Nipple, One Billion Rising, the 2017 Women's March, the 2018 Women's March, and the #MeToo movement. In December 2017, \"Time\" magazine chose several prominent female activists involved in the #MeToo movement, dubbed \"the silence breakers\", as Person of the Year.\nDecolonial feminism.\nDecolonial feminism reformulates the coloniality of gender by critiquing the very formation of gender and its subsequent formations of patriarchy and the gender binary, not as universal constants across cultures, but as structures that have been instituted by and for the benefit of European colonialism. Mar\u00eca Lugones proposes that decolonial feminism speaks to how \"the colonial imposition of gender cuts across questions of ecology, economics, government, relations with the spirit world, and knowledge, as well as across everyday practices that either habituate us to take care of the world or to destroy it.\" Decolonial feminists like Karla Jessen Williamson and Rauna Kuokkanen have examined colonialism as a force that has imposed gender hierarchies on Indigenous women that have disempowered and fractured Indigenous communities and ways of life.\nPostfeminism.\nThe term postfeminism is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being \"anti-feminist\", postfeminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third- and fourth-wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas. Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society. Amelia Jones has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity. Dorothy Chunn describes a \"blaming narrative\" under the postfeminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for gender equality in a \"post-feminist\" society, where \"gender equality has (already) been achieved\". According to Chunn, \"many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them\".\nTheory.\nFeminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.\nIn the field of literary criticism, Elaine Showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls \"feminist critique\", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls \"gynocriticism\", in which the \"woman is producer of textual meaning\". The last phase she calls \"gender theory\", in which the \"ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored\".\nThis was paralleled in the 1970s by French feminists, who developed the concept of \"\u00e9criture f\u00e9minine\" (which translates as \"female or feminine writing\"). H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous argues that writing and philosophy are \"\" and along with other French feminists such as Luce Irigaray emphasize \"writing from the body\" as a subversive exercise. The work of Julia Kristeva, a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and Bracha Ettinger, artist and psychoanalyst, has influenced feminist theory in general and feminist literary criticism in particular. However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, \"none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the Anglophone world\".\nMovements and ideologies.\nMany overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years. Feminism is often divided into three main traditions called liberal, radical, and socialist/Marxist feminism, sometimes known as the \"Big Three\" schools of feminist thought. Since the late 20th century, newer forms of feminisms have also emerged. Some branches of feminism track the political leanings of the larger society to a greater or lesser degree, or focus on specific topics, such as the environment.\nLiberal feminism.\nLiberal feminism, also known under other names such as reformist, mainstream, or historically as bourgeois feminism, arose from 19th-century first-wave feminism, and was historically linked to 19th-century liberalism and progressivism, while 19th-century conservatives tended to oppose feminism as such. Liberal feminism seeks equality of men and women through political and legal reform within a liberal democratic framework, without radically altering the structure of society; liberal feminism \"works within the structure of mainstream society to integrate women into that structure\". During the 19th and early 20th centuries liberal feminism focused especially on women's suffrage and access to education. Former Norwegian supreme court justice and former president of the liberal Norwegian Association for Women's Rights, Karin Maria Bruzelius, has described liberal feminism as \"a realistic, sober, practical feminism\".\nSusan Wendell argues that \"liberal feminism is an historical tradition that grew out of liberalism, as can be seen very clearly in the work of such feminists as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill, but feminists who took principles from that tradition have developed analyses and goals that go far beyond those of 18th and 19th century liberal feminists, and many feminists who have goals and strategies identified as liberal feminist\u00a0... reject major components of liberalism\" in a modern or party-political sense; she highlights \"equality of opportunity\" as a defining feature of liberal feminism.\nLiberal feminism is a very broad term that encompasses many, often diverging modern branches and a variety of feminist and general political perspectives; some historically liberal branches are equality feminism, social feminism, equity feminism, difference feminism, individualist/libertarian feminism, and some forms of state feminism, particularly the state feminism of the Nordic countries. The broad field of liberal feminism is sometimes confused with the more recent and smaller branch known as libertarian feminism, which tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism. For example, \"libertarian feminism does not require social measures to reduce material inequality; in fact, it opposes such measures\u00a0... in contrast, liberal feminism may support such requirements and egalitarian versions of feminism insist on them.\"\nCatherine Rottenberg notes that the raison d'\u00eatre of classic liberal feminism was \"to pose an immanent critique of liberalism, revealing the gendered exclusions within liberal democracy's proclamation of universal equality, particularly with respect to the law, institutional access, and the full incorporation of women into the public sphere.\" Rottenberg contrasts classic liberal feminism with modern neoliberal feminism, which \"seems perfectly in sync with the evolving neoliberal order.\" According to Zhang and Rios, \"liberal feminism tends to be adopted by 'mainstream' (i.e., middle-class) women who do not disagree with the current social structure.\" They found that liberal feminism with its focus on equality is viewed as the dominant and \"default\" form of feminism.\nSome modern forms of feminism that historically grew out of the broader liberal tradition have more recently also been described as conservative in relative terms. This is particularly the case for libertarian feminism which conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.\nRadical feminism.\nRadical feminism arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy. It considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.\nMaterialist ideologies.\nRosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.\nOther modern feminisms.\nEcofeminism.\nEcofeminists see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment. Ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.\nBlack and postcolonial ideologies.\nSara Ahmed argues that Black and postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge \"to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought\". During much of its history, feminist movements and theoretical developments were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America. However, women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms. This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the end of Western European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of color or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms. Womanism emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class. Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless. Third-world feminism and indigenous feminism are closely related to postcolonial feminism. These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism, Stiwanism, negofeminism, femalism, transnational feminism, and Africana womanism.\nSocial constructionist ideologies.\nIn the late 20th century various feminists began to argue that gender roles are socially constructed, and that it is impossible to generalize women's experiences across cultures and histories. Post-structural feminism draws on the philosophies of post-structuralism and deconstruction in order to argue that the concept of gender is created socially and culturally through discourse. Postmodern feminists also emphasize the social construction of gender and the discursive nature of reality; however, as Pamela Abbott et al. write, a postmodern approach to feminism highlights \"the existence of multiple truths (rather than simply men and women's standpoints)\".\nTransgender people.\nThird-wave feminists tend to view the struggle for trans rights as an integral part of intersectional feminism. Fourth-wave feminists also tend to be trans-inclusive. The American National Organization for Women (NOW) president Terry O'Neill said the struggle against transphobia is a feminist issue and NOW has affirmed that \"trans women are women, trans girls are girls.\" Several studies have found that people who identify as feminists tend to be more accepting of trans people than those who do not.\nAn ideology variously known as trans-exclusionary radical feminism (or its acronym, TERF) or gender-critical feminism is critical of concepts of gender identity and transgender rights, holding that biological sex characteristics are an immutable determination of gender or supersede the importance of gender identity, that trans women are not women, and that trans men are not men. These views have been described as transphobic by many other feminists.\nCultural movements.\nRiot grrrls took an anti-corporate stance of self-sufficiency and self-reliance. Riot grrrl's emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave. The movement encouraged and made \"adolescent girls' standpoints central\", allowing them to express themselves fully. Lipstick feminism is a cultural feminist movement that attempts to respond to the backlash of second-wave radical feminism of the 1960s and 1970s by reclaiming symbols of \"feminine\" identity such as make-up, suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure as valid and empowering personal choices.\nDemographics.\nAccording to 2014 Ipsos poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87 percent agreed that \"women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender\". However, only 55 percent of women agreed that they have \"full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations\". Taken together, these studies reflect the importance differentiating between claiming a \"feminist identity\" and holding \"feminist attitudes or beliefs\".\nAccording to a 2015 poll, 18 percent of Americans use the label of \"feminist\" to describe themselves, while 85 percent are feminists in practice as they reported they believe in \"equality for women\". The poll found that 52 percent did not identify as feminist, 26 percent were unsure, and 4 percent provided no response.\nSociological research shows that, in the US, increased educational attainment is associated with greater support for feminist issues. In addition, politically liberal people are more likely to support feminist ideals compared to those who are conservative.\nAccording to a 2016 Survation poll for the Fawcett Society, 7 percent of Britons use the label of \"feminist\" to describe themselves, while 83 percent say they support equality of opportunity for women \u2013 this included higher support from men (86%) than women (81%).\nSexuality.\nFeminist views on sexuality vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.\nSex industry.\nOpinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists who are critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and reflect a woman's right to control and define her own sexuality.\nFeminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression and a legitimate career. Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.\nAffirming female sexual autonomy.\nFor feminists, a woman's right to control her own sexuality is a key issue and one that is heavily contested between different branches of feminism. Radical feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Radical feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. Some radical feminists have argued that women should not engage in heterosexual sex, and choose lesbianism as a lifestyle and political choice, a view that has fallen out of favor, as sexuality is seen as largely biologically influenced rather than a choice one can make for political reasons.\nSome radical feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that deny women's right to sexual expression, because men under a patriarchy define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In some conservative and religious cultures marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.\nIn 1968, radical feminist Anne Koedt argued in her essay \"The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm\" that women's biology and the clitoral orgasm had not been properly analyzed and popularized, because men \"have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina\" and not the clitoral area.\nOther branches of feminism such as individualist feminism consider themselves sex-positive, and see women's expression of their own sexuality as a right. In this view, what is or is not \"degrading\" is subjective, and each person has a right to decide for themselves what sexual acts they find degrading and if they want to participate in them or not. Individualist feminist, Wendy McElroy wrote in her book, XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography, \"let's examine [...] the idea that pornography is degrading to women. Degrading is a subjective term. Personally, I find detergent commercials in which women become orgasmic over soapsuds to be tremendously degrading to women. I find movies in which prostitutes are treated like ignorant drug addicts to be slander against women. Every woman has the right\u2014the need!\u2014to define degradation for herself.\"\nAccording to this view, part of sexual autonomy is the right to define one's boundaries, desires and limits around their sexuality rather than accept a narrative in which all women are victims of men during a sex act.\nScience.\nSandra Harding says that the \"moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds.\" Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, \"I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore.\"\nLynn Hankinson Nelson writes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women and to \"uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them\" to account for a range of human experience. Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions. Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.\nOne criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings. Susan Haack also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); Meera Nanda further cautions that this may in fact trap women within \"traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy\".\nBiology and gender.\nModern feminism challenges the essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, \"Myths of Gender\", explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In \"Delusions of Gender\", Cordelia Fine disputes scientific evidence that suggests that there is an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.\nFeminist psychology.\nFeminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates in psychology, women and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.\nCulture.\nDesign.\nThere is a long history of feminist activity in design disciplines like industrial design, graphic design, and fashion design. This work has explored topics like beauty, DIY, feminine approaches to design and community-based projects. Some iconic writing includes Cheryl Buckley's essays on design and patriarchy and Joan Rothschild's \"Design and Feminism: Re-Visioning Spaces, Places, and Everyday Things\". More recently, Isabel Prochner's research explored how feminist perspectives can support positive change in industrial design, helping to identify systemic social problems and inequities in design and guiding socially sustainable and grassroots design solutions.\nBusinesses.\nFeminist activists have established a range of feminist businesses, including feminist bookstores, credit unions, presses, mail-order catalogs, and restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the second and third waves of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\nVisual arts.\nCorresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s. Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as \"the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period\", and Peggy Phelan says that it \"brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades\". Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created \"The Dinner Party\", a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the 1970s, said in 2009 to \"ARTnews\", \"There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are trying to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's art is not an exception\u2014it's a normal part of art history.\" A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn, giving voice to the ways \"contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment\".\nLiterature.\nThe feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest. There has also been a close link between feminist literature and activism, with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.\nMuch of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like Dale Spender's \"\" (1986) and Jane Spencer's \"The Rise of the Woman Novelist\" (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.\nCommensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th- and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s, Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women. More recently, Broadview Press continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early women's novels.\nParticular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792) by Mary Wollstonecraft, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929) by Virginia Woolf, is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.\nThe widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the literary canon. Interest in post-colonial literatures, gay and lesbian literature, writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered \"literature\", and genres hitherto not regarded as \"literary\", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest. Most genres and subgenres have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies have entered new territories such as the \"female gothic\" or women's science fiction.\nAccording to Elyce Rae Helford, \"Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice.\" Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender. Notable texts of this kind are Ursula K. Le Guin's \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" (1969), Joanna Russ' \"The Female Man\" (1970), Octavia Butler's \"Kindred\" (1979) and Margaret Atwood's \"Handmaid's Tale\" (1985).\nFeminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.\nIn addition, many feminist movements have embraced poetry as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.\nMoreover, historical pieces of writing by women have been used by feminists to speak about what women's lives were like in the past while demonstrating the power that they held and the impact they had in their communities. An important figure in the history of women's literature is Hrotsvitha (\u2013973), a canoness who was an early female poet in the German lands. As a historian, Hrotsvitha is one of the few writers to address women's lives from a woman's perspective during the Middle Ages. Hrotsvitha's six short dramas are considered to be her magnum opus. She has been called \"the most remarkable woman of her time\" and an important figure in the history of women.\nMusic.\nWomen's music (or womyn's music or wimmin's music) is the music by women, for women, and about women. The genre emerged as a musical expression of the second-wave feminist movement as well as the labour, civil rights, and peace movements. The movement was started by lesbians such as Cris Williamson, Meg Christian, and Margie Adam, African-American women activists such as Bernice Johnson Reagon and her group Sweet Honey in the Rock, and peace activist Holly Near. Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include studio musicians, producers, sound engineers, technicians, cover artists, distributors, promoters, and festival organizers who are also women.\nFeminism became a principal concern of musicologists in the 1980s as part of the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre, and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron, and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.\nWhile the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.\nCinema.\nFeminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of feminist film theory in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, \"Women &amp; Film\". Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women's Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.\nIt has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language. Bracha L. Ettinger invented a field of notions and concepts that serve the research of cinema from feminine perspective: The Matrixial Gaze. Ettinger's language include original concepts to discover feminine perspectives. Many writers in the fields of film theory and contemporary art are using the Ettingerian matrixial sphere (matricial sphere).\nDuring the 1930s\u20131950s heyday of the big Hollywood studios, the status of women in the industry was abysmal. Since then female directors such as Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion have made art movies, and directors like Kathryn Bigelow and Patty Jenkins have had mainstream success. This progress stagnated in the 1990s, and men outnumber women five to one in behind the camera roles.\nPolitics.\nFeminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the 20th century.\nSocialism.\nSince the late 19th century, some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. August Bebel, an early activist of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), published his work \"Die Frau und der Sozialismus\", juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an International Conference of Socialist Women in Stuttgart where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. Clara Zetkin of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a \"socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question\".\nIn Britain, the women's movement was allied with the Labour party. In the U.S., Betty Friedan emerged from a radical background to take leadership. Radical Women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active. During the Spanish Civil War, Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri (\"La Pasionaria\") led the Communist Party of Spain. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the anarcha-feminist Mujeres Libres.\nFeminists in Ireland in the early 20th century included the revolutionary Irish Republican, suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz, who in 1918 was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn F\u00e9in abstentionist policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected to the Second D\u00e1il in the elections of 1921. She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army, which was led by the socialist and self-described feminist Irish leader James Connolly, during the 1916 Easter Rising.\nFascism.\nFascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the Fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the \"fasci femminilli\" and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator Benito Mussolini's more conservative coalition partners.\nCyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of Adolf Hitler, feminism has a complicated relationship with the Nazi movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment. However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism, and after the rise of Nazism in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s. Georges Duby et al. write that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position. Blamires also writes that neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept \"their traditional roles\".\nCivil rights movement and anti-racism.\nThe civil rights movement has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many American feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tensions arose during the late 1960s and the 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white, straight, and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with issues of race and sexuality. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist and homophobic elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about identity politics and the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism; they also generated new feminisms such as black feminism and Chicana feminism in addition to making large contributions to lesbian feminism and other integrations of queer of color identity.\nNeoliberalism.\nNeoliberalism has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south. Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking. Women's experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.\nProponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have stated that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations. Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labor, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace. The \"feminization of employment\" refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labor conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe, and secure. Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labor and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages. Social constructs about feminized labor have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as \"secondary\" income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.\nSocietal impact.\nThe feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more equal payment to men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.\nCivil rights.\nFrom the 1960s on, the campaign for women's rights was met with mixed results in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the EEC agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.\nSome feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to child sexual abuse. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.\nIn the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which did not pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in \"Roe\" v. \"Wade\" enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term.\nThe division of labor within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework, although Cathy Young responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting. Judith K. Brown writes, \"Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted.\"\nIn international law, the \"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\" (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and described as an international bill of rights for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.\nJurisprudence.\nFeminist jurisprudence is a branch of jurisprudence that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.\nFeminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see the law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.\nLanguage.\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society. According to \"The Handbook of English Linguistics\", generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances \"where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species.\"\nMerriam-Webster chose \"feminism\" as its 2017 Word of the Year, noting that \"Word of the Year is a quantitative measure of interest in a particular word.\"\nTheology.\nFeminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.\nChristian feminism is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance, and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.\nIslamic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, \"hadith\" (sayings of Muhammad), and \"sharia\" (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also used secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.\nBuddhist feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Buddhism. It is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist Rita Gross describes Buddhist feminism as \"the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men\".\nJewish feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or \"minyan\", the exemption from positive time-bound \"mitzvot\", and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.\nSecular or atheist feminists have engaged in feminist criticism of religion, arguing that many religions have oppressive rules towards women and misogynistic themes and elements in religious texts.\nPatriarchy.\nPatriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system, fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and is dependent on female subordination. Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. Carole Pateman argues that the patriarchal distinction \"between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection.\" In feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations. Some radical feminists have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, separatism is the only viable solution. Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.\nMen and masculinity.\nFeminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations. Patriarchal cultures are criticized for \"limiting forms of masculinity\" available to men and thus narrowing their life choices. Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.\nMale participation in feminism is generally encouraged by feminists and is seen as an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that men and women should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism.\nReactions.\nDifferent groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist. The US media tends to portray feminism negatively and feminists \"are less often associated with day-to-day work/leisure activities of regular women\". However, as recent research has demonstrated, as people are exposed to self-identified feminists and to discussions relating to various forms of feminism, their own self-identification with feminism increases.\nPro-feminism.\nPro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.\nAnti-feminism and criticism of feminism.\nAnti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.\nIn the 19th century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.\nSome people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. Some anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained. Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.\nWriters such as Camille Paglia, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women. Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge argue that the term \"anti-feminist\" is used to silence academic debate about feminism. A meta-analysis in 2023 published in the journal \"Psychology of Women Quarterly\" investigated the stereotype of feminists' attitudes to men and concluded that feminist views of men were no different to that of non-feminists or men towards men and titled the phenomenon the misandry myth, based on \"evidence that it is false and widespread\".\nSecular humanism.\nSecular humanism is an ethical framework that attempts to dispense with any unreasoned dogma, pseudoscience, and superstition. Critics of feminism sometimes ask \"Why feminism and not humanism?\". Some humanists argue, however, that the goals of feminists and humanists largely overlap, and the distinction is only in motivation. For example, a humanist may consider abortion in terms of a utilitarian ethical framework, rather than considering the motivation of any particular woman in getting an abortion. In this respect, it is possible to be a humanist without being a feminist, but this does not preclude the existence of feminist humanism. Humanism played a significant role in protofeminism during the Renaissance period in such that humanists made educated women popular figures despite the challenge of the patriarchal organization of society."}

Its powers include air traffic control, certification of personnel and aircraft, setting standards for airports, and protection of U.S. assets during the launch or re-entry of commercial space vehicles. Powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the FAA by authority of the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nThe FAA was created in as the Federal Aviation Agency, replacing the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA). In 1967, the FAA became part of the newly formed U.S. Department of Transportation and was renamed the Federal Aviation Administration.\nMajor functions.\nThe FAA's roles include:\nOrganizations.\nThe FAA operates five \"lines of business\". Their functions are:\nRegions and Aeronautical Center operations.\nThe FAA is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and also operates the William J. Hughes Technical Center near Atlantic City, New Jersey, for support and research, and the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for training. The FAA has nine regional administrative offices:\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Air Commerce Act of May 20, 1926, is the cornerstone of the U.S. federal government's regulation of civil aviation. This landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry, whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards. The Act charged the Secretary of Commerce with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules, licensing pilots, certifying aircraft, establishing airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation. The newly created Aeronautics Branch, operating under the Department of Commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight.\nIn fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the U.S. Department of Commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft. It took over the building and operation of the nation's system of lighted airways, a task initiated by the Post Office Department. The Department of Commerce improved aeronautical radio communications\u2014before the founding of the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, which handles most such matters today\u2014and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation.\nThe Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department. As commercial flying increased, the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control (ATC) along the airways. In 1936, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system. The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities.\nIn 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the Commerce Department to a new independent agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The legislation also expanded the government's role by giving the CAA the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve.\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940: the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). CAA was responsible for ATC, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. CAB was entrusted with safety regulation, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. The CAA was part of the Department of Commerce. The CAB was an independent federal agency.\nOn the eve of America's entry into World War II, CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports. This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war. The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. In 1946, meanwhile, Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation's civil airports.\nFormation.\nThe approaching era of jet travel (and a series of midair collisions\u2014most notably the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision) prompted passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. This legislation passed the CAA's functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency. The act also transferred air safety regulation from the CAB to the FAA, and gave it sole responsibility for a joint civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. The FAA's first administrator, Elwood R. Quesada, was a former Air Force general and adviser to President Eisenhower.\nThe same year witnessed the birth of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which was created in response to the Soviet Union (USSR) launch of the first manmade satellite. NASA assumed NACA's aeronautical research role.\n1960s reorganization.\nIn 1967, a new U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport. The Federal Aviation Agency's name changed to the Federal Aviation Administration as it became one of several agencies (e.g., Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, the Coast Guard, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Commission) within DOT. The FAA administrator no longer reported directly to the president, but instead to the Secretary of Transportation. New programs and budget requests would have to be approved by DOT, which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president.\nAt the same time, a new National Transportation Safety Board took over the Civil Aeronautics Board's (CAB) role of investigating and determining the causes of transportation accidents and making recommendations to the secretary of transportation. CAB was merged into DOT with its responsibilities limited to the regulation of commercial airline routes and fares.\nThe FAA gradually assumed additional functions. The hijacking epidemic of the 1960s had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security. In response to the hijackings on September 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the Department of Homeland Security. The FAA became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968 when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards. Legislation in 1970 gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety. During the 1960s and 1970s, the FAA also started to regulate high altitude (over 500 feet) kite and balloon flying.\n1970s and deregulation.\nBy the mid-1970s, the agency had achieved a semi-automated air traffic control system using both radar and computer technology. This system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth, however, especially after the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 phased out the CAB's economic regulation of the airlines. A nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in 1981 forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. During the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing. In 1994, the FAA shifted to a more step-by-step approach that has provided controllers with advanced equipment.\nIn 1979, Congress authorized the FAA to work with major commercial airports to define noise pollution contours and investigate the feasibility of noise mitigation by residential retrofit programs. Throughout the 1980s, these charters were implemented.\nIn the 1990s, satellite technology received increased emphasis in the FAA's development programs as a means to improvements in communications, navigation, and airspace management. In 1995, the agency assumed responsibility for safety oversight of commercial space transportation, a function begun eleven years before by an office within DOT headquarters. The agency was responsible for the decision to ground flights after the September 11 attacks.\n21st century.\nIn December 2000, an organization within the FAA called the Air Traffic Organization, (ATO) was set up by presidential executive order. This became the air navigation service provider for the airspace of the United States and for the New York (Atlantic) and Oakland (Pacific) oceanic areas. It is a full member of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation.\nThe FAA issues a number of awards to holders of its certificates. Among these are demonstrated proficiencies as an aviation mechanic (the AMT Awards), a flight instructor (Gold Seal certification), a 50-year aviator (Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award), a 50-year mechanic (Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award) or as a proficient pilot. The latter, the FAA \"WINGS Program\", provides a lifetime series of grouped proficiency activities at three levels (Basic, Advanced, and Master) for pilots who have undergone several hours of ground and flight training since their last WINGS award, or \"Phase\". The FAA encourages volunteerism in the promotion of aviation safety. The FAA Safety Team, or FAASTeam, works with Volunteers at several levels and promotes safety education and outreach nationwide.\nOn March 18, 2008, the FAA ordered its inspectors to reconfirm that airlines are complying with federal rules after revelations that Southwest Airlines flew dozens of aircraft without certain mandatory inspections. The FAA exercises surprise Red Team drills on national airports annually.\nOn October 31, 2013, after outcry from media outlets, including heavy criticism from Nick Bilton of \"The New York Times\", the FAA announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight, but mobile phone calls would still be prohibited (and use of cellular networks during any point when aircraft doors are closed remains prohibited to-date). Implementation initially varied among airlines. The FAA expected many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of 2013. Devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. Mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to Federal Communications Commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones. From a technological standpoint, cellular service would not work in-flight because of the rapid speed of the airborne aircraft: mobile phones cannot switch fast enough between cellular towers at an aircraft's high speed. However, the ban is due to potential radio interference with aircraft avionics. If an air carrier provides Wi-Fi service during flight, passengers may use it. Short-range Bluetooth accessories, like wireless keyboards, can also be used.\nIn July 2014, in the wake of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the FAA suspended flights by U.S. airlines to Ben Gurion Airport during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict for 24 hours. The ban was extended for a further 24 hours but was lifted about six hours later.\nThe FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 gives the FAA one year to establish minimum pitch, width and length for airplane seats, to ensure they are safe for passengers.\nAs of 2018,\nthe FAA plans to replace the \"FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure\" (FTI) program with the \"FAA Enterprise Network Services\" (FENS) program.\nThe first FAA licensed orbital human space flight took place on November 15, 2020, carried out by SpaceX on behalf of NASA.\nHistory of FAA Administrators.\nThe administrator is appointed for a five-year term.\nOn March 19, 2019, President Donald Trump announced he would nominate Stephen Dickson, a former executive and pilot at Delta Air Lines, to be the next FAA Administrator. On July 24, 2019, the Senate confirmed Dickson by a vote of 52\u201340. He was sworn in as Administrator by Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on August 12, 2019. On February 16, 2022, Dickson announced his resignation as FAA Administrator, effective March 31, 2022. In September 2023, President Joe Biden announced that he would be nominating Mike Whitaker to lead the FAA. Whitaker previously served as deputy administrator of the FAA under President Barack Obama.\nCriticism.\nConflicting roles.\nThe FAA has been cited as an example of regulatory capture, \"in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules, arranging for not only beneficial regulation, but placing key people to head these regulators.\" Retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz, who used to be a Special Agent with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation and with FAA Security, is one of the most outspoken critics of FAA. Rather than commend the agency for proposing a $10.2 million fine against Southwest Airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008, he was quoted as saying the following in an Associated Press story: \"Penalties against airlines that violate FAA directives should be stiffer. At $25,000 per violation, Gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.\" Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate. The dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory. For example, to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an FAA regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel.\nOn July 22, 2008, in the aftermath of the Southwest Airlines inspection scandal, a bill was unanimously approved in the House to tighten regulations concerning airplane maintenance procedures, including the establishment of a whistleblower office and a two-year \"cooling off\" period that FAA inspectors or supervisors of inspectors must wait before they can work for those they regulated. The bill also required rotation of principal maintenance inspectors and stipulated that the word \"customer\" properly applies to the flying public, not those entities regulated by the FAA. The bill died in a Senate committee that year.\nIn September 2009, the FAA administrator issued a directive mandating that the agency use the term \"customers\" to refer to only the flying public.\nLax regulatory oversight.\nIn 2007, two FAA whistleblowers, inspectors Charalambe \"Bobby\" Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage of an aircraft, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee, said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a \"culture of coziness\" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and \"a systematic breakdown\" in the FAA's culture that resulted in \"malfeasance, bordering on corruption\". In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks,&lt;ref name=\"ap-mailtrib/msnbc\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.\nChanges to air traffic controller application process.\nIn 2014, the FAA modified its approach to air traffic control hiring. It launched more \"off the street bids\", allowing anyone with either a four-year degree or five years of full-time work experience to apply, rather than the closed college program or Veterans Recruitment Appointment bids, something that had last been done in 2008. Thousands were hired, including veterans, Collegiate Training Initiative graduates, and people who are true \"off the street\" hires. The move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a CTI program. Before the change, candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be \"fast-tracked\" for consideration. However, the CTI program had no guarantee of a job offer, nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic. The goal of the program was to prepare people for the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, OK. Having a CTI certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the Air Traffic Basics part of the academy, about a 30- to 45-day course, and go right into Initial Qualification Training (IQT). All prospective controllers, CTI or not, have had to pass the FAA Academy in order to be hired as a controller. Failure at the academy means FAA employment is terminated. In January 2015 they launched another pipeline, a \"prior experience\" bid, where anyone with an FAA Control Tower Operator certificate (CTO) and 52 weeks of experience could apply. This was a revolving bid, every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out, and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities, bypassing the FAA academy entirely.\nIn the process of promoting diversity, the FAA revised its hiring process. The FAA later issued a report that the \"bio-data\" was not a reliable test for future performance. However, the \"Bio-Q\" was not the determining factor for hiring, it was merely a screening tool to determine who would take a revised Air Traffic Standardized Aptitude Test (ATSAT). Due to cost and time, it was not practical to give all 30,000 some applicants the revised ATSAT, which has since been validated. In 2015 Fox News levied criticism that the FAA discriminated against qualified candidates.\nIn December 2015, a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed against the FAA seeking class-action status for the thousands of men and women who spent up to $40,000 getting trained under FAA rules before they were abruptly changed. The prospects of the lawsuit are unknown, as the FAA is a self-governing entity and therefore can alter and experiment with its hiring practices, and there was never any guarantee of a job in the CTI program.\nClose Calls.\nIn August 2023 \"The New York Times\" published an investigative report that showed overworked air traffic controllers at understaffed facilities making errors that resulted in 46 near collisions in the air and on the ground in the month of July alone.\nNext Generation Air Transportation System.\nA May 2017 letter from staff of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to members of the same committee sent before a meeting to discuss air traffic control privatization noted a 35-year legacy of failed air traffic control modernization management, including NextGen. The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the National Research Council noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).\nMore precise Performance Based Navigation can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths. A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes. The result of this change is that many localities experience huge increases in air traffic over previously quiet areas. Complaints have risen with the added traffic and multiple municipalities have filed suit.\nBoeing 737 MAX controversy.\nAs a result of the March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash and the Lion Air Flight 610 crash five months earlier, most airlines and countries began grounding the Boeing 737 MAX 8 (and in many cases all MAX variants) due to safety concerns, but the FAA declined to ground MAX 8 aircraft operating in the U.S. On March 12, the FAA said that its ongoing review showed \"no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.\" Some U.S. Senators called for the FAA to ground the aircraft until an investigation into the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash was complete. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that \"If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.\" The FAA resisted grounding the aircraft until March 13, 2019, when it received evidence of similarities in the two accidents. By then, 51 other regulators had already grounded the plane, and by March 18, 2019, all 387 aircraft in service were grounded. Three major U.S. airlines--Southwest, United, and American Airlines\u2014were affected by this decision.\nFurther investigations also revealed that the FAA and Boeing had colluded on recertification test flights, attempted to cover up important information and that the FAA had retaliated against whistleblowers.\nRegulatory process.\nDesignated Engineering Representative.\nA Designated Engineering Representative (DER) is an engineer who is appointed under 14 CFR section 183.29 to act on behalf of a company or as an independent consultant (IC). The DER system enables the FAA to delegate certain involvement in airworthiness exams, tests, and inspections to qualified technical people outside of the FAA. Qualifications and policies for appointment of Designated Airworthiness Representatives are established in FAA Order 8100.8, \"Designee Management Handbook\". Working procedures for DERs are prescribed in FAA Order 8110.37, \"Designated Engineering Representative (DER) Handbook\".\nNeither type of DER is an employee of either the FAA or the United States government. While a DER represents the FAA when acting under the authority of a DER appointment; a DER has no federal protection for work done or the decisions made as a DER. Neither does the FAA provide any indemnification for a DER from general tort law. \"The FAA cannot shelter or protect DERs from the consequences of their findings.\"\nDesignated Airworthiness Representative (DAR).\nA DAR is an individual appointed in accordance with 14 CFR 183.33 who may perform examination, inspection, and testing services necessary to the issuance of certificates. There are two types of DARs: manufacturing, and maintenance.\nSpecialized Experience\u00a0\u2013 Amateur-Built and Light-Sport Aircraft DARs Both Manufacturing DARs and Maintenance DARs may be authorized to perform airworthiness certification of light-sport aircraft. DAR qualification criteria and selection procedures for amateur-built and light-sport aircraft airworthiness functions are provided in Order 8100.8.\nContinued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC).\nA Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (commonly abbreviated as CANIC) is a notification from the FAA to civil airworthiness authorities of foreign countries of pending significant safety actions.\nThe FAA Airworthiness Directives Manual, states the following:\n8. Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC).\nNotable CANICs.\nThe FAA issued a CANIC to state the continued airworthiness of the Boeing 737 MAX, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\nAnother CANIC notified the ungrounding of the MAX, ending a 20-month grounding.\nProposed regulatory reforms.\nFAA reauthorization and air traffic control reform.\nU.S. law requires that the FAA's budget and mandate be reauthorized on a regular basis. On July 18, 2016, President Obama signed a second short-term extension of the FAA authorization, replacing a previous extension that was due to expire that day.\nThe 2016 extension (set to expire itself in September 2017) left out a provision pushed by Republican House leadership, including House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&amp;I) Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA). The provision would have moved authority over air traffic control from the FAA to a non-profit corporation, as many other nations, such as Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, have done. Shuster's bill, the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act, expired in the House at the end of the 114th Congress.\nThe House T&amp;I Committee began the new reauthorization process for the FAA in February 2017. It is expected that the committee will again urge Congress to consider and adopt air traffic control reform as part of the reauthorization package. Shuster has additional support from President Trump, who, in a meeting with aviation industry executives in early 2017 said the U.S. air control system is \"...totally out of whack.\""}

{"id": "11188", "revid": "41376680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11188", "title": "French Revolution", "text": "The French Revolution ( ) was a period of political and societal change in France which began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799. Many of the revolution's ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy, and its values remain central to modern French political discourse.\nThe causes of the revolution were a combination of social, political, and economic factors which the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\" (\"old regime\") proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789, its first meeting since 1614. The representatives of the Third Estate broke away and re-constituted themselves as a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille in Paris on 14 July was followed by radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church, and a declaration of rights. The next three years were dominated by a struggle for political control. King Louis XVI's attempted flight to Varennes in June 1791 further discredited the monarchy, and military defeats after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 led to an armed insurrection on 10 August 1792. The monarchy was replaced by the French First Republic in September, and Louis XVI was executed in January 1793.\nAfter another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended, and political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety, dominated by radical Jacobins led by Maximilien Robespierre. About 16,000 people were sentenced by the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed in the Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794 with the Thermidorian Reaction. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Committee of Public Safety was replaced in November 1795 by the Directory. Its instability ended in the coup of 18 Brumaire and the establishment of the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul.\nCauses.\nThe Revolution resulted from multiple long-term and short-term factors, culminating in a social, economic, financial and political crisis in the late 1780s. Combined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his ministers, the result was a crisis the state was unable to manage.\nBetween 1715 and 1789, the French population grew from 21 to 28 million, 20% of whom lived in towns or cities, Paris alone having over 600,000 inhabitants. This was accompanied by a tripling in the size of the middle class, which comprised almost 10% of the population by 1789. Despite increases in overall prosperity, its benefits were largely restricted to the rentier and mercantile classes, while the living standards fell for wage labourers and peasant farmers who rented their land. Economic recession from 1785, combined with bad harvests in 1787 and 1788, led to high unemployment and food prices, causing a financial and political crisis.\nWhile the state also experienced a debt crisis, the level of debt itself was not high compared with Britain's. A significant problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another, were often different from the official amounts, and were collected inconsistently. Its complexity meant uncertainty over the amount contributed by any authorised tax caused resentment among all taxpayers. Attempts to simplify the system were blocked by the regional \"Parlements\" which approved financial policy. The resulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates General of 1789, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances.\nLouis XVI was willing to consider reforms, but he often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility. Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely discussed among the educated French elite. At the same time, the American Revolution and the European revolts of the 1780s inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism, liberty, equality, and democracy. These shaped the response of the educated public to the crisis, while scandals such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace fuelled widespread anger at the court, nobility, and church officials.\nCrisis of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\".\nFinancial and political crisis.\nFrance faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure. Although the economy grew solidly, the increase was not reflected in a proportional growth in taxes, their collection being contracted to tax farmers who kept much of it as personal profit. As the nobility and Church benefited from many exemptions, the tax burden fell mainly on peasants. Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to be registered with regional judicial bodies or \"parlements\" that were able to block them. The king could impose laws by decree, but this risked open conflict with the \"parlements\", the nobility, and those subject to new taxes.\nFrance primarily funded the Anglo-French War of 1778\u20131783 through loans. Following the peace, the monarchy borrowed heavily, culminating in a debt crisis. By 1788, half of state revenue was required to service its debt. In 1786, the French finance minister, Calonne, proposed a package of reforms including a universal land tax, the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs, and new provincial assemblies appointed by the king. The new taxes were rejected, first by a hand-picked Assembly of Notables dominated by the nobility, then by the \"parlements\" when submitted by Calonne's successor Brienne. The notables and \"parlements\" argued that the proposed taxes could only be approved by an Estates-General, a representative body that had last met in 1614.\nThe conflict between the Crown and the \"parlements\" became a national political crisis. Both sides issued a series of public statements, the government arguing that it was combating privilege and the \"parlement\" defending the ancient rights of the nation. Public opinion was firmly on the side of the \"parlements\", and riots broke out in several towns. Brienne's attempts to raise new loans failed, and on 8 August 1788, he announced that the king would summon an Estates-General to convene the following May. Brienne resigned and was replaced by Jacques Necker.\nIn September 1788, the Parlement of Paris ruled that the Estates-General should convene in the same form as in 1614, meaning that the three estates (the clergy, nobility, and Third Estate or \"commons\") would meet and vote separately, with votes counted by estate rather than by head. As a result, the clergy and nobility could combine to outvote the Third Estate despite representing less than 5% of the population.\nFollowing the relaxation of censorship and laws against political clubs, a group of liberal nobles and middle class activists known as the Society of Thirty launched a campaign for the doubling of Third Estate representation and individual voting. The public debate sparked an average of 25 new political pamphlets published each week from 25 September 1788. The Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s issued influential pamphlets titled \"What Is the Third Estate?\" denouncing the privilege of the clergy and nobility, and arguing the Third Estate represented the nation and should sit alone as a National Assembly. Activists such as Jean Joseph Mounier, Antoine Barnave and Maximilien Robespierre organised regional meetings, petitions and literature in support of these demands. In December, the king agreed to double the representation of the Third Estate but left the question of counting votes for the Estates-General to decide.\nEstates-General of 1789.\nThe Estates-General contained three separate bodies, the First Estate representing 100,000 clergy, the Second the nobility, and the Third the \"commons\". Since each met separately, and any proposals had to be approved by at least two, the First and Second Estates could outvote the Third despite representing less than 5% of the population.\nAlthough the Catholic Church in France owned nearly 10% of all land, as well as receiving annual tithes paid by peasants, three-quarters of the 303 clergy elected were parish priests, many of whom earned less than unskilled labourers and had more in common with their poor parishioners than with the bishops of the first estate. The Second Estate elected 322 deputies, representing about 400,000 men and women, who owned about 25% of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their tenants. Most delegates were town-dwelling members of the \"noblesse d'\u00e9p\u00e9e\", or traditional aristocracy. Courtiers and representatives of the (those who derived rank from judicial or administrative posts) were underrepresented. Of the 610 deputies of the Third Estate, about two-thirds held legal qualifications and almost half were venal office holders. Less than 100 were in trade or industry, and none were peasants or artisans. To assist delegates, each region completed a list of grievances, known as \"Cahiers de dol\u00e9ances\". Tax inequality and seigneurial dues (feudal payments owed to landowners) headed the grievances in the \"cahiers de doleances\" for the estate.\nOn 5 May 1789 the Estates-General convened at Versailles. Necker outlined the state budget and reiterated the king's decision that each estate should decide on which matters it would agree to meet and vote in common with the other estates. On the following day, each estate was to separately verify the credentials of their representatives. The Third Estate, however, voted to invite the other estates to join them in verifying all the representatives of the Estates-General in common and to agree that votes should be counted by head. Fruitless negotiations lasted to 12 June when the Third Estate began verifying its own members. On 17 June, the Third Estate declared itself to be the National Assembly of France and that all existing taxes were illegal. Within two days, more than 100 members of the clergy had joined them.\nShaken by this challenge to his authority, the king agreed to a reform package that he would announce at a royal session of the Estates-General. The \"Salle des \u00c9tats\" was closed to prepare for the joint session, but the members of the Estates-General were not informed in advance. On 20 June, when the members of the Third Estate found their meeting place closed, they moved to a nearby tennis court and swore not to disperse until a new constitution had been agreed.\nAt the royal session the king announced a series of tax and other reforms and stated that no new taxes or loans would be implemented without the consent of the Estates-General. However, he stated that the three estates were sacrosanct and it was up to each estate to agree to end their privileges and decide on which matters they would vote in common with the other estates. At the end of the session the Third Estate refused to leave the hall and reiterated their oath not to disperse until a constitution had been agreed. Over the next days more members of the clergy joined the National Assembly. On 27 June, faced with popular demonstrations and mutinies in his French Guards, Louis XVI capitulated. He commanded the members of the first and second estates to join the third in the National Assembly.\nConstitutional monarchy (July 1789 \u2013 September 1792).\nAbolition of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\".\nEven the limited reforms the king had announced went too far for Marie Antoinette and Louis' younger brother the Comte d'Artois. On their advice, Louis dismissed Necker again as chief minister on 11 July. On 12 July, the Assembly went into a non-stop session following rumours that the king was planning to use the Swiss Guards to force it to close. The news brought crowds of protestors into the streets, and soldiers of the elite refused to disperse them.\nOn 14 July many of these soldiers joined a crowd attacking the Bastille, a royal fortress with large stores of arms and ammunition. Its governor, Bernard-Ren\u00e9 de Launay, surrendered after several hours of fighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers. Launay was taken to the , where he was killed and his head placed on a pike and paraded around the city. Although rumoured to hold many prisoners, the Bastille held only seven: four forgers, a lunatic, a failed assassin, and a deviant nobleman. Nevertheless, it was a potent symbol of the and it was demolished in the following weeks. Bastille Day has become the French national holiday.\nAlarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital, Louis appointed the Marquis de Lafayette commander of the National Guard, with Jean-Sylvain Bailly as head of a new administrative structure known as the Commune. On 17 July, Louis visited Paris accompanied by 100 deputies, where he was greeted by Bailly and accepted a tricolore cockade to loud cheers. However, it was clear power had shifted from his court; he was welcomed as 'Louis XVI, father of the French and king of a free people.'\nThe short-lived unity enforced on the Assembly by a common threat quickly dissipated. Deputies argued over constitutional forms, while civil authority rapidly deteriorated. On 22 July, former Finance Minister Joseph Foullon and his son were lynched by a Parisian mob, and neither Bailly nor Lafayette could prevent it. In rural areas, wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of militia and an agrarian insurrection known as the Great Fear. The breakdown of law and order and frequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad. These \"\u00e9migr\u00e9s\" funded reactionary forces within France and urged foreign monarchs to back a counter-revolution.\nIn response, the Assembly published the August Decrees which abolished feudalism. Over 25% of French farmland was subject to feudal dues, providing the nobility with most of their income; these were now cancelled, along with church tithes. While their former tenants were supposed to pay them compensation, collecting it proved impossible, and the obligation was annulled in 1793. Other decrees included equality before the law, opening public office to all, freedom of worship, and cancellation of special privileges held by provinces and towns.\nWith the suspension of the 13 regional in November, the key institutional pillars of the old regime had all been abolished in less than four months. From its early stages, the Revolution therefore displayed signs of its radical nature; what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning intentions into practical applications.\nCreating a new constitution.\nOn 9 July, the National Assembly declared itself the National Constituent Assembly and appointed a committee to draft a constitution and statement of rights. Twenty drafts were submitted, which were used by a sub-committee to create a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, with Mirabeau being the most prominent member. The declaration was approved by the Assembly and published on 26 August as a statement of principle.\nThe Assembly now concentrated on the constitution. Mounier and his monarchist supporters advocated a bicameral system, with an upper house appointed by the king, who would also have the right to appoint ministers and veto legislation. On 10 September, the majority of the Assembly, led by Siey\u00e8s and Talleyrand, voted in favour of a single body, and the following day approved a \"suspensive veto\" for the king, meaning Louis could delay implementation of a law but not block it indefinitely. In October, the Assembly voted to restrict political rights, including voting rights, to \"active citizens\", defined as French males over the age of 25 who paid direct taxes equal to three days' labour. The remainder were designated \"passive citizens\", restricted to \"civil rights\", a distinction opposed by a significant minority, including the Jacobin clubs. By mid-1790, the main elements of a constitutional monarchy were in place, although the constitution was not accepted by Louis until 1791.\nFood shortages and the worsening economy caused frustration at the lack of progress and led to popular unrest in Paris. This came to a head in late September 1789, when the Flanders Regiment arrived in Versailles to reinforce the royal bodyguard and were welcomed with a formal banquet as was common practice. The radical press described this as a 'gluttonous orgy' and claimed the tricolour cockade had been abused, while the Assembly viewed their arrival as an attempt to intimidate them.\nOn 5 October, crowds of women assembled outside the \"H\u00f4tel de Ville\", agitating against high food prices and shortages. These protests quickly turned political, and after seizing weapons stored at the \"H\u00f4tel de Ville,\" some 7,000 of them marched on Versailles, where they entered the Assembly to present their demands. They were followed to Versailles by 15,000 members of the National Guard under Lafayette, who was virtually \"a prisoner of his own troops\".\nWhen the National Guard arrived later that evening, Lafayette persuaded Louis the safety of his family required their relocation to Paris. Next morning, some of the protestors broke into the royal apartments, searching for Marie Antoinette, who had escaped. They ransacked the palace, killing several guards. Order was eventually restored, and the royal family and Assembly left for Paris, escorted by the National Guard. Louis had announced his acceptance of the August Decrees and the declaration, and his official title changed from 'King of France' to 'King of the French'.\nCatholic Church.\nHistorian John McManners argues \"in eighteenth-century France, throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence.\" One suggestion is that after a century of persecution, some French Protestants actively supported an anti-Catholic regime, a resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, considered a philosophical founder of the revolution, wrote it was \"manifestly contrary to the law of nature... that a handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities, while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities.\"\nThe Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Catholic Church to the state; although the extent of religious belief has been questioned, elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant by 1789 being French also meant being Catholic. The church was the largest individual landowner in France, controlling nearly 10% of all estates and levied tithes, effectively a 10% tax on income, collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops. In return, it provided a minimal level of social support.\nThe August Decrees abolished tithes, and on 2 November the Assembly confiscated all church property, the value of which was used to back a new paper currency known as . In return, the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned. On 13 February 1790, religious orders and monasteries were dissolved, while monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life.\nThe Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 12 July 1790 made them employees of the state, established rates of pay, and developed a system for electing priests and bishops. Pope Pius VI and many French Catholics objected to this since it denied the authority of the Pope over the French church. In October, 30 bishops wrote a declaration denouncing the law, further fuelling opposition. When clergy were required to swear loyalty to the Civil Constitution in November, it split the church between the 24% who complied and the majority who refused. This stiffened popular resistance against state interference, especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as Normandy, Brittany and the Vend\u00e9e, where only a few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution. The result was state-led persecution of \"refractory clergy\", many of whom were forced into exile, deported, or executed.\nPolitical divisions.\nThe period from October 1789 to spring 1791 is usually seen as one of relative tranquility, when some of the most important legislative reforms were enacted. However, conflict over the source of legitimate authority was more apparent in the provinces, where officers of the had been swept away but not yet replaced by new structures. This was less obvious in Paris, since the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe, but disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly.\nCentrists led by Siey\u00e8s, Lafayette, Mirabeau and Bailly created a majority by forging consensus with like Mounier, and independents including Adrien Duport, Barnave and Alexandre Lameth. At one end of the political spectrum, reactionaries like Cazal\u00e8s and Maury denounced the Revolution in all its forms, with radicals like Maximilien Robespierre at the other. He and Jean-Paul Marat opposed the criteria for \"active citizens\", gaining them substantial support among the Parisian proletariat, many of whom had been disenfranchised by the measure.\nOn 14 July 1790, celebrations were held throughout France commemorating the fall of the Bastille, with participants swearing an oath of fidelity to \"the nation, the law and the king.\" The in Paris was attended by the royal family, with Talleyrand performing a mass. Despite this show of unity, the Assembly was increasingly divided, while external players like the Paris Commune and National Guard competed for power. One of the most significant was the Jacobin club; originally a forum for general debate, by August 1790 it had over 150 members, split into different factions.\nThe Assembly continued to develop new institutions; in September 1790, the regional were abolished and their legal functions replaced by a new independent judiciary, with jury trials for criminal cases. However, moderate deputies were uneasy at popular demands for universal suffrage, labour unions and cheap bread, and over the winter of 1790 and 1791, they passed a series of measures intended to disarm popular radicalism. These included exclusion of poorer citizens from the National Guard, limits on use of petitions and posters, and the June 1791 Le Chapelier Law suppressing trade guilds and any form of worker organisation.\nThe traditional force for preserving law and order was the army, which was increasingly divided between officers, who largely came from the nobility, and ordinary soldiers. In August 1790, the loyalist General Bouill\u00e9 suppressed a serious mutiny at Nancy; although congratulated by the Assembly, he was criticised by Jacobin radicals for the severity of his actions. Growing disorder meant many professional officers either left or became \u00e9migr\u00e9s, further destabilising the institution.\nVarennes and after.\nHeld in the Tuileries Palace under virtual house arrest, Louis XVI was urged by his brother and wife to re-assert his independence by taking refuge with Bouill\u00e9, who was based at Montm\u00e9dy with 10,000 soldiers considered loyal to the Crown. The royal family left the palace in disguise on the night of 20 June 1791; late the next day, Louis was recognised as he passed through Varennes, arrested and taken back to Paris. The attempted escape had a profound impact on public opinion; since it was clear Louis had been seeking refuge in Austria, the Assembly now demanded oaths of loyalty to the regime and began preparing for war, while fear of 'spies and traitors' became pervasive.\nDespite calls to replace the monarchy with a republic, Louis retained his position but was generally regarded with acute suspicion and forced to swear allegiance to the constitution. A new decree stated retracting this oath, making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would be considered abdication. However, radicals led by Jacques Pierre Brissot prepared a petition demanding his deposition, and on 17 July, an immense crowd gathered in the Champ de Mars to sign. Led by Lafayette, the National Guard was ordered to \"preserve public order\" and responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd, killing between 13 and 50 people.\nThe massacre badly damaged Lafayette's reputation; the authorities responded by closing radical clubs and newspapers, while their leaders went into exile or hiding, including Marat. On 27 August, Emperor Leopold II and King Frederick William II of Prussia issued the Declaration of Pillnitz declaring their support for Louis and hinting at an invasion of France on his behalf. In reality, the meeting between Leopold and Frederick was primarily to discuss the partitions of Poland; the declaration was intended to satisfy Comte d'Artois and other French \u00e9migr\u00e9s, but the threat rallied popular support behind the regime.\nBased on a motion proposed by Robespierre, existing deputies were barred from elections held in September for the French Legislative Assembly. Although Robespierre was one of those excluded, his support in the clubs gave him a political power base not available to Lafayette and Bailly, who resigned respectively as head of the National Guard and the Paris Commune. The new laws were gathered together in the 1791 Constitution, and submitted to Louis XVI, who pledged to defend it \"from enemies at home and abroad\". On 30 September, the Constituent Assembly was dissolved, and the Legislative Assembly convened the next day.\nFall of the monarchy.\nThe Legislative Assembly is often dismissed by historians as an ineffective body, compromised by divisions over the role of the monarchy, an issue exacerbated when Louis attempted to prevent or reverse limitations on his powers. At the same time, restricting the vote to those who paid a minimal amount of tax disenfranchised a significant proportion of the 6\u00a0million Frenchmen over 25, while only 10% of those able to vote actually did so. Finally, poor harvests and rising food prices led to unrest among the urban class known as \"sans-culottes\", who saw the new regime as failing to meet their demands for bread and work.\nThis meant the new constitution was opposed by significant elements inside and outside the Assembly, itself split into three main groups. 264 members were affiliated with Barnave's , constitutional monarchists who considered the Revolution had gone far enough, while another 136 were Jacobin leftists who supported a republic, led by Brissot and usually referred to as . The remaining 345 belonged to , a centrist faction who switched votes depending on the issue, but many of whom shared doubts as to whether Louis was committed to the Revolution. After he officially accepted the new Constitution, one recorded response was \"\", or \"Long live the king \u2013 if he keeps his word\".\nAlthough a minority in the Assembly, control of key committees allowed the to provoke Louis into using his veto. They first managed to pass decrees confiscating \u00e9migr\u00e9 property and threatening them with the death penalty. This was followed by measures against non-juring priests, whose opposition to the Civil Constitution led to a state of near civil war in southern France, which Barnave tried to defuse by relaxing the more punitive provisions. On 29 November, the Assembly approved a decree giving refractory clergy eight days to comply, or face charges of 'conspiracy against the nation', an act opposed even by Robespierre. When Louis vetoed both, his opponents were able to portray him as opposed to reform in general.\nBrissot accompanied this with a campaign for war against Austria and Prussia, often interpreted as a mixture of calculation and idealism. While exploiting popular anti-Austrianism, it reflected a genuine belief in exporting the values of political liberty and popular sovereignty. Simultaneously, conservatives headed by Marie Antoinette also favoured war, seeing it as a way to regain control of the military, and restore royal authority. In December 1791, Louis made a speech in the Assembly giving foreign powers a month to disband the \u00e9migr\u00e9s or face war, an act greeted with enthusiasm by supporters, but suspicion from opponents.\nBarnave's inability to build a consensus in the Assembly resulted in the appointment of a new government, chiefly composed of . On 20 April 1792, the French Revolutionary Wars began when French armies attacked Austrian and Prussian forces along their borders, before suffering a series of disastrous defeats. In an effort to mobilise popular support, the government ordered non-juring priests to swear the oath or be deported, dissolved the Constitutional Guard and replaced it with 20,000 ; Louis agreed to disband the Guard, but vetoed the other two proposals, while Lafayette called on the Assembly to suppress the clubs.\nPopular anger increased when details of the Brunswick Manifesto reached Paris on 1 August, threatening 'unforgettable vengeance' should any oppose the Allies in seeking to restore the power of the monarchy. On the morning of 10 August, a combined force of the Paris National Guard and provincial f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s attacked the Tuileries Palace, killing many of the Swiss Guards protecting it. Louis and his family took refuge with the Assembly and shortly after 11:00 am, the deputies present voted to 'temporarily relieve the king', effectively suspending the monarchy.\nFirst Republic (1792\u20131795).\nProclamation of the First Republic.\nIn late August, elections were held for the National Convention. Restrictions on the franchise meant the number of votes cast fell to 3.3\u00a0million, versus 4\u00a0million in 1791, while intimidation was widespread. The \"Brissotins\" split between moderate \"Girondins\" led by Brissot, and radical \"Montagnards\", headed by Robespierre, Georges Danton and Jean-Paul Marat. While loyalties constantly shifted, voting patterns suggest roughly 160 of the 749 deputies can generally be categorised as \"Girondists\", with another 200 \"Montagnards\". The remainder were part of a centrist faction known as \"La Plaine\", headed by Bertrand Bar\u00e8re, Pierre Joseph Cambon and Lazare Carnot.\nIn the September Massacres, between 1,100 and 1,600 prisoners held in Parisian jails were summarily executed, the vast majority being common criminals. A response to the capture of Longwy and Verdun by Prussia, the perpetrators were largely National Guard members and \"f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s\" on their way to the front. While responsibility is still disputed, even moderates expressed sympathy for the action, which soon spread to the provinces. One suggestion is that the killings stemmed from concern over growing lawlessness, rather than political ideology.\nOn 20 September, the French defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Valmy, in what was the first major victory by the army of France during the Revolutionary Wars. Emboldened by this, on 22 September the Convention replaced the monarchy with the French First Republic and introduced a new calendar, with 1792 becoming \"Year One\". The next few months were taken up with the trial of \"Citoyen Louis Capet\", formerly Louis XVI. While evenly divided on the question of his guilt, members of the convention were increasingly influenced by radicals based within the Jacobin clubs and Paris Commune. The Brunswick Manifesto made it easy to portray Louis as a threat to the Revolution, especially when extracts from his personal correspondence showed him conspiring with Royalist exiles.\nOn 17 January 1793, Louis was sentenced to death for \"conspiracy against public liberty and general safety\". 361 deputies were in favour, 288 against, while another 72 voted to execute him, subject to delaying conditions. The sentence was carried out on 21 January on the \"Place de la R\u00e9volution\", now the Place de la Concorde. Conservatives across Europe called for the destruction of revolutionary France, and in February the Convention responded by declaring war on Britain and the Dutch Republic. Together with Austria and Prussia, these two countries were later joined by Spain, Portugal, Naples, and Tuscany in the War of the First Coalition.\nPolitical crisis and fall of the Girondins.\nThe Girondins hoped war would unite the people behind the government and provide an excuse for rising prices and food shortages, but they found themselves the target of popular anger. Many left for the provinces. The first conscription measure or \"lev\u00e9e en masse\" on 24 February sparked riots in Paris and other regional centres. Already unsettled by changes imposed on the church, in March the traditionally conservative and royalist Vend\u00e9e rose in revolt. On 18th, General Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez was defeated at Neerwinden and defected to the Austrians. Uprisings followed in Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulon, Marseille and Caen. The Republic seemed on the verge of collapse.\nThe crisis led to the creation on 6 April 1793 of the Committee of Public Safety, an executive committee accountable to the convention. The Girondins made a fatal political error by indicting Marat before the Revolutionary Tribunal for allegedly directing the September massacres; he was quickly acquitted, further isolating the Girondins from the \"sans-culottes\". When Jacques H\u00e9bert called for a popular revolt against the \"henchmen of Louis Capet\" on 24 May, he was arrested by the Commission of Twelve, a Girondin-dominated tribunal set up to expose 'plots'. In response to protests by the Commune, the Commission warned \"if by your incessant rebellions something befalls the representatives of the nation, Paris will be obliterated\".\nGrowing discontent allowed the clubs to mobilise against the Girondins. Backed by the Commune and elements of the National Guard, on 31 May they attempted to seize power in a coup. Although the coup failed, on 2 June the convention was surrounded by a crowd of up to 80,000, demanding cheap bread, unemployment pay and political reforms, including restriction of the vote to the \"sans-culottes\", and the right to remove deputies at will. Ten members of the commission and another twenty-nine members of the Girondin faction were arrested, and on 10 June, the Montagnards took over the Committee of Public Safety.\nMeanwhile, a committee led by Robespierre's close ally Louis Antoine de Saint-Just was tasked with preparing a new constitution. Completed in only eight days, it was ratified by the convention on 24 June and contained radical reforms, including universal male suffrage. However, normal legal processes were suspended following the assassination of Marat on 13 July by the Girondist Charlotte Corday, which the Committee of Public Safety used as an excuse to take control. The 1793 Constitution was suspended indefinitely in October.\nKey areas of focus for the new government included creating a new state ideology, economic regulation and winning the war. They were helped by divisions among their internal opponents; while areas like the Vend\u00e9e and Brittany wanted to restore the monarchy, most supported the Republic but opposed the regime in Paris. On 17 August, the Convention voted a second \"lev\u00e9e en masse\"; despite initial problems in equipping and supplying such large numbers, by mid-October Republican forces had re-taken Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux, while defeating Coalition armies at Hondschoote and Wattignies. The new class of military leaders included a young colonel named Napoleon Bonaparte, who was appointed commander of artillery at the siege of Toulon thanks to his friendship with Augustin Robespierre. His success in that role resulted in promotion to the Army of Italy in April 1794, and the beginning of his rise to military and political power.\nReign of Terror.\nAlthough intended to bolster revolutionary fervour, the Reign of Terror rapidly degenerated into the settlement of personal grievances. At the end of July, the Convention set price controls on a wide range of goods, with the death penalty for hoarders. On 9 September, 'revolutionary groups' were established to enforce these controls, while the Law of Suspects on 17 September approved the arrest of suspected \"enemies of freedom\". This initiated what has become known as the \"Terror\". From September 1793 to July 1794, around 300,000 were arrested, with some 16,600 people executed on charges of counter-revolutionary activity, while another 40,000 may have been summarily executed, or died awaiting trial.\nPrice controls made farmers reluctant to sell their produce in Parisian markets, and by early September the city was suffering acute food shortages. At the same time, the war increased public debt, which the Assembly tried to finance by selling confiscated property. However, few would buy assets that might be repossessed by their former owners, a concern that could only be achieved by military victory. This meant the financial position worsened as threats to the Republic increased, while printing \"assignats\" to deal with the deficit further increased inflation.\nOn 10 October, the Convention recognised the Committee of Public Safety as the supreme Revolutionary Government and suspended the constitution until peace was achieved. In mid-October, Marie Antoinette was convicted of a long list of crimes and guillotined; two weeks later, the Girondist leaders arrested in June were also executed, along with Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9. The \"Terror\" was not confined to Paris, with over 2,000 killed in Lyons after its recapture.\nAt Cholet on 17 October, the Republican army won a decisive victory over the Vend\u00e9e rebels, and the survivors escaped into Brittany. A defeat at Le Mans on 23 December ended the rebellion as a major threat, although the insurgency continued until 1796. The extent of the repression that followed has been debated by French historians since the mid-19th century. Between November 1793 and February 1794, over 4,000 were drowned in the Loire at Nantes under the supervision of Jean-Baptiste Carrier. Historian Reynald Secher claims that as many as 117,000 died between 1793 and 1796. Although those numbers have been challenged, Fran\u00e7ois Furet concludes it \"not only revealed massacre and destruction on an unprecedented scale, but a zeal so violent that it has bestowed as its legacy much of the region's identity.\" \nAt the height of the Terror, not even its supporters were immune from suspicion, leading to divisions within the \"Montagnard\" faction between radical \"H\u00e9bertists\" and moderates led by Danton. Robespierre saw their dispute as de-stabilising the regime, and, as a deist, objected to the anti-religious policies advocated by the atheist H\u00e9bert, who was arrested and executed on 24 March with 19 of his colleagues, including Carrier. To retain the loyalty of the remaining H\u00e9bertists, Danton was arrested and executed on 5 April with Camille Desmoulins, after a show trial that arguably did more damage to Robespierre than any other act in this period.\nThe Law of 22 Prairial (10 June) denied \"enemies of the people\" the right to defend themselves. Those arrested in the provinces were sent to Paris for judgment; from March to July, executions in Paris increased from 5 to 26 per day. Many Jacobins ridiculed the festival of the Cult of the Supreme Being on 8 June, a lavish and expensive ceremony led by Robespierre, who was also accused of circulating claims he was a second Messiah. Relaxation of price controls and rampant inflation caused increasing unrest among the \"sans-culottes\", but the improved military situation reduced fears the Republic was in danger. Fearing their own survival depended on Robespierre's removal, on 29 June three members of the Committee of Public Safety openly accused him of being a dictator. Robespierre responded by refusing to attend Committee meetings, allowing his opponents to build a coalition against him. In a speech made to the convention on 26 July, he claimed certain members were conspiring against the Republic, an almost certain death sentence if confirmed. When he refused to provide names, the session broke up in confusion. That evening he repeated these claims at the Jacobins club, where it was greeted with demands for execution of the 'traitors'. Fearing the consequences if they did not act first, his opponents attacked Robespierre and his allies in the Convention next day. When Robespierre attempted to speak, his voice failed, one deputy crying \"The blood of Danton chokes him!\"\nAfter the Convention authorised his arrest, he and his supporters took refuge in the \"Hotel de Ville\", which was defended by elements of the National Guard. Other units loyal to the Convention stormed the building that evening and detained Robespierre, who severely injured himself attempting suicide. He was executed on 28 July with 19 colleagues, including Saint-Just and Georges Couthon, followed by 83 members of the Commune. The Law of 22 Prairial was repealed, any surviving Girondists reinstated as deputies, and the Jacobin Club was closed and banned.\nThere are various interpretations of the Terror and the violence with which it was conducted. Furet argues that the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries and their utopian goals required the extermination of any opposition. A middle position suggests violence was not inevitable but the product of a series of complex internal events, exacerbated by war.\nThermidorian reaction.\nThe bloodshed did not end with the death of Robespierre; southern France saw a wave of revenge killings, directed against alleged Jacobins, Republican officials and Protestants. Although the victors of Thermidor asserted control over the Commune by executing their leaders, some of those closely involved in the \"Terror\" retained their positions. They included Paul Barras, later chief executive of the French Directory, and Joseph Fouch\u00e9, director of the killings in Lyon who served as Minister of Police under the Directory, the Consulate and Empire. Despite his links to Augustin Robespierre, military success in Italy meant Bonaparte escaped censure.\nThe December 1794 Treaty of La Jaunaye ended the Chouannerie in western France by allowing freedom of worship and the return of non-juring priests. This was accompanied by military success; in January 1795, French forces helped the Dutch Patriots set up the Batavian Republic, securing their northern border. The war with Prussia was concluded in favour of France by the Peace of Basel in April 1795, while Spain made peace shortly thereafter.\nHowever, the Republic still faced a crisis at home. Food shortages arising from a poor 1794 harvest were exacerbated in northern France by the need to supply the army in Flanders, while the winter was the worst since 1709. By April 1795, people were starving, and the \"assignat\" was worth only 8% of its face value; in desperation, the Parisian poor rose again. They were quickly dispersed and the main impact was another round of arrests, while Jacobin prisoners in Lyon were summarily executed.\nA committee drafted the Constitution of the Year III, approved by plebiscite on 23 September 1795 and put into place on 27 September. Largely designed by Pierre Daunou and Boissy d'Anglas, it established a bicameral legislature, intended to slow down the legislative process, ending the wild swings of policy under the previous unicameral systems. The Council of 500 was responsible for drafting legislation, which was reviewed and approved by the Council of Ancients, an upper house containing 250 men over the age of 40. Executive power was in the hands of five directors, selected by the Council of Ancients from a list provided by the lower house, with a five-year mandate.\nDeputies were chosen by indirect election, a total franchise of around 5\u00a0million voting in primaries for 30,000 electors, or 0.6% of the population. Since they were also subject to stringent property qualification, it guaranteed the return of conservative or moderate deputies. In addition, rather than dissolving the previous legislature as in 1791 and 1792, the so-called 'law of two-thirds' ruled only 150 new deputies would be elected each year. The remaining 600 \"Conventionnels\" kept their seats, a move intended to ensure stability.\nFrench Directory (1795\u20131799).\nJacobin sympathisers viewed the French Directory as a betrayal of the Revolution, while Bonapartists later justified Napoleon's coup by emphasising its corruption. The regime also faced internal unrest, a weak economy, and an expensive war, while the Council of 500 could block legislation at will. Since the directors had no power to call new elections, the only way to break a deadlock was rule by decree or use force. As a result, the directory was characterised by \"chronic violence, ambivalent forms of justice, and repeated recourse to heavy-handed repression.\"\nRetention of the ensured the Thermidorians held a majority in the legislature and three of the five directors, but they were increasingly challenged by the right. On 5 October, Convention troops led by Napoleon put down a royalist rising in Paris; when the first legislative elections were held two weeks later, over 100 of the 150 new deputies were royalists of some sort. The power of the Parisian had been broken by the suppression of the May 1795 revolt; relieved of pressure from below, the Jacobin clubs became supporters of the directory, largely to prevent restoration of the monarchy.\nRemoval of price controls and a collapse in the value of the led to inflation and soaring food prices. By April 1796, over 500,000 Parisians were unemployed, resulting in the May insurrection known as the Conspiracy of the Equals. Led by the revolutionary Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf, their demands included immediate implementation of the 1793 Constitution, and a more equitable distribution of wealth. Despite support from sections of the military, the revolt was easily crushed, while Babeuf and other leaders were executed. Nevertheless, by 1799 the economy had been stabilised, and important reforms made allowing steady expansion of French industry. Many of these remained in place for much of the 19th century.\nPrior to 1797, three of the five directors were firmly Republican; Barras, R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell, as were around 40% of the legislature. The same percentage were broadly centrist or unaffiliated, along with two directors, \u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Letourneur and Lazare Carnot. Although only 20% were committed Royalists, many centrists supported the restoration of the exiled Louis XVIII in the belief this would bring peace. The elections of May 1797 resulted in significant gains for the right, with Royalists Jean-Charles Pichegru elected president of the Council of 500, and Barth\u00e9lemy appointed a director.\nWith Royalists apparently on the verge of power, Republicans attempted a pre-emptive coup on 4 September. Using troops from Napoleon's Army of Italy under Pierre Augereau, the Council of 500 was forced to approve the arrest of Barth\u00e9lemy, Pichegru and Carnot. The elections were annulled, 63 leading Royalists deported to French Guiana, and laws were passed against \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Royalists and ultra-Jacobins. The removal of his conservative opponents opened the way for direct conflict between Barras and those on the left.\nFighting continued despite general war weariness, and the 1798 elections resulted in a resurgence in Jacobin strength. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in July 1798 confirmed European fears of French expansionism, and the War of the Second Coalition began in November. Without a majority in the legislature, the directors relied on the army to enforce decrees and extract revenue from conquered territories. Generals like Napoleon and Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert became central to the political process, while both the army and directory became notorious for their corruption.\nIt has been suggested the directory collapsed because by 1799, many 'preferred the uncertainties of authoritarian rule to the continuing ambiguities of parliamentary politics'. The architect of its end was Siey\u00e8s, who when asked what he had done during the Terror allegedly answered \"I survived\". Nominated to the directory, his first action was to remove Barras, with the help of allies including Talleyrand, and Napoleon's brother Lucien, president of the Council of 500. On 9 November 1799, the coup of 18 Brumaire replaced the five directors with the French Consulate, which consisted of three members, Napoleon, Siey\u00e8s, and Roger Ducos. Most historians consider this the end point of the French Revolution.\nRole of ideology.\nThe role of ideology in the Revolution is controversial with Jonathan Israel stating that the \"radical Enlightenment\" was the primary driving force of the Revolution. Cobban, however, argues \"[t]he actions of the revolutionaries were most often prescribed by the need to find practical solutions to immediate problems, using the resources at hand, not by pre-conceived theories.\"\nThe identification of ideologies is complicated by the profusion of revolutionary clubs, factions and publications, absence of formal political parties, and individual flexibility in the face of changing circumstances. In addition, although the Declaration of the Rights of Man was a fundamental document for all revolutionary factions, its interpretation varied widely.\nWhile all revolutionaries professed their devotion to liberty in principle, \"it appeared to mean whatever those in power wanted.\" For example, the liberties specified in the Rights of Man were limited by law when they might \"cause harm to others, or be abused\". Prior to 1792, Jacobins and others frequently opposed press restrictions on the grounds these violated a basic right. However, the radical National Convention passed laws in September 1793 and July 1794 imposing the death penalty for offences such as \"disparaging the National Convention\", and \"misleading public opinion.\"\nWhile revolutionaries also endorsed the principle of equality, few advocated equality of wealth since property was also viewed as a right. The National Assembly opposed equal political rights for women, while the abolition of slavery in the colonies was delayed until February 1794 because it conflicted with the property rights of slave owners, and many feared it would disrupt trade. Political equality for male citizens was another divisive issue, with the 1791 constitution limiting the right to vote and stand for office to males over 25 who met a property qualification, so-called \"active citizens\". This restriction was opposed by many activists, including Robespierre, the Jacobins, and Cordeliers.\nThe principle that sovereignty resided in the nation was a key concept of the Revolution. However, Israel argues this obscures ideological differences over whether the will of the nation was best expressed through representative assemblies and constitutions, or direct action by revolutionary crowds, and popular assemblies such as the sections of the Paris commune. Many considered constitutional monarchy as incompatible with the principle of popular sovereignty, but prior to 1792, there was a strong bloc with an ideological commitment to such a system, based on the writings of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Montesquieu and Voltaire.\nIsrael argues the nationalisation of church property and the establishment of the Constitutional Church reflected an ideological commitment to secularism, and a determination to undermine a bastion of old regime privilege. While Cobban agrees the Constitutional Church was motivated by ideology, he sees its origins in the anti-clericalism of Voltaire and other Enlightenment figures.\nJacobins were hostile to formal political parties and factions which they saw as a threat to national unity and the general will, with \"political virtue\" and \"love of country\" key elements of their ideology. They viewed the ideal revolutionary as selfless, sincere, free of political ambition, and devoted to the nation. The disputes leading to the departure first of the \"Feuillants\", then later the \"Girondists\", were conducted in terms of the relative political virtue and patriotism of the disputants. In December 1793, all members of the Jacobin clubs were subject to a \"purifying scrutiny\", to determine whether they were \"men of virtue\".\nFrench Revolutionary Wars.\nThe Revolution initiated a series of conflicts that began in 1792 and ended with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815. In its early stages, this seemed unlikely; the 1791 Constitution specifically disavowed \"war for the purpose of conquest\", and although traditional tensions between France and Austria re-emerged in the 1780s, Emperor Joseph II cautiously welcomed the reforms. Austria was at war with the Ottomans, as were the Russians, while both were negotiating with Prussia over partitioning Poland. Most importantly, Britain preferred peace, and as Emperor Leopold II stated after the Declaration of Pillnitz, \"without England, there is no case\".\nIn late 1791, factions within the Assembly came to see war as a way to unite the country and secure the Revolution by eliminating hostile forces on its borders and establishing its \"natural frontiers\". France declared war on Austria in April 1792 and issued the first conscription orders, with recruits serving for twelve months. By the time peace finally came in 1815, the conflict had involved every major European power as well as the United States, redrawn the map of Europe and expanded into the Americas, the Middle East, and the Indian Ocean.\nFrom 1701 to 1801, the population of Europe grew from 118 to 187\u00a0million; combined with new mass production techniques, this allowed belligerents to support large armies, requiring the mobilisation of national resources. It was a different kind of war, fought by nations rather than kings, intended to destroy their opponents' ability to resist, but also to implement deep-ranging social change. While all wars are political to some degree, this period was remarkable for the emphasis placed on reshaping boundaries and the creation of entirely new European states.\nIn April 1792, French armies invaded the Austrian Netherlands but suffered a series of setbacks before victory over an Austrian-Prussian army at Valmy in September. After defeating a second Austrian army at Jemappes on 6 November, they occupied the Netherlands, areas of the Rhineland, Nice and Savoy. Emboldened by this success, in February 1793 France declared war on the Dutch Republic, Spain and Britain, beginning the War of the First Coalition. However, the expiration of the 12-month term for the 1792 recruits forced the French to relinquish their conquests. In August, new conscription measures were passed, and by May 1794 the French army had between 750,000 and 800,000 men. Despite high rates of desertion, this was large enough to manage multiple internal and external threats; for comparison, the combined Prussian-Austrian army was less than 90,000.\nBy February 1795, France had annexed the Austrian Netherlands, established their frontier on the left bank of the Rhine and replaced the Dutch Republic with the Batavian Republic, a satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the anti-French coalition; Prussia made peace in April 1795, followed soon after by Spain, leaving Britain and Austria as the only major powers still in the war. In October 1797, a series of defeats by Bonaparte in Italy led Austria to agree to the Treaty of Campo Formio, in which they formally ceded the Netherlands and recognised the Cisalpine Republic.\nFighting continued for two reasons; first, French state finances had come to rely on indemnities levied on their defeated opponents. Second, armies were primarily loyal to their generals, for whom the wealth achieved by victory and the status it conferred became objectives in themselves. Leading soldiers like Hoche, Pichegru and Carnot wielded significant political influence and often set policy; Campo Formio was approved by Bonaparte, not the Directory, which strongly objected to terms it considered too lenient.\nDespite these concerns, the Directory never developed a realistic peace programme, fearing the destabilising effects of peace and the consequent demobilisation of hundreds of thousands of young men. As long as the generals and their armies stayed away from Paris, they were happy to allow them to continue fighting, a key factor behind sanctioning Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt. This resulted in aggressive and opportunistic policies, leading to the War of the Second Coalition in November 1798.\nSlavery and the colonies.\nIn 1789, the most populous French colonies were Saint-Domingue (today Haiti), Martinique, Guadeloupe, the \u00cele Bourbon (R\u00e9union) and the \u00cele\u00a0de la France. These colonies produced commodities such as sugar, coffee and cotton for exclusive export to France. There were about 700,000 slaves in the colonies, of which about 500,000 were in Saint-Domingue. Colonial products accounted for about a third of France's exports.\nIn February 1788, the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs\" (Society of the Friends of Blacks) was formed in France with the aim of abolishing slavery in the empire. In August 1789, colonial slave owners and merchants formed the rival \"Club de Massiac\" to represent their interests. When the Constituent Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August 1789, delegates representing the colonial landowners successfully argued that the principles should not apply in the colonies as they would bring economic ruin and disrupt trade. Colonial landowners also gained control of the Colonial Committee of the Assembly from where they exerted a powerful influence against abolition.\nPeople of colour also faced social and legal discrimination in mainland France and its colonies, including a bar on their access to professions such as law, medicine and pharmacy. In 1789\u201390, a delegation of free coloureds, led by Vincent Og\u00e9 and Julien Raimond, unsuccessfully lobbied the Assembly to end discrimination against free coloureds. Og\u00e9 left for Saint-Domingue where an uprising against white landowners broke out in October 1790. The revolt failed, and Og\u00e9 was killed.\nIn May 1791, the National Assembly granted full political rights to coloureds born of two free parents but left the rights of freed slaves to be determined by the colonial assemblies. The assemblies refused to implement the decree and fighting broke out between the coloured population of Saint-Domingue and white colonists, each side recruiting slaves to their forces. A major slave revolt followed in August.\nIn March 1792, the Legislative Assembly responded to the revolt by granting citizenship to all free coloureds and sending two commissioners, L\u00e9ger-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Sonthonax and \u00c9tienne Polverel, and 6,000 troops to Saint-Domingue to enforce the decree. On arrival in September, the commissioners announced that slavery would remain in force. Over 72,000 slaves were still in revolt, mostly in the north.\nBrissot and his supporters envisaged an eventual abolition of slavery but their immediate concern was securing trade and the support of merchants for the revolutionary wars. After Brissot's fall, the new constitution of June 1793 included a new Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen but excluded the colonies from its provisions. In any event, the new constitution was suspended until France was at peace.\nIn early 1793, royalist planters from Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue formed an alliance with Britain. The Spanish supported insurgent slaves, led by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Papillon and Georges Biassou, in the north of Saint-Domingue. White planters loyal to the republic sent representatives to Paris to convince the Jacobin controlled Convention that those calling for the abolition of slavery were British agents and supporters of Brissot, hoping to disrupt trade.\nIn June, the commissioners in Saint-Domingue freed 10,000 slaves fighting for the republic. As the royalists and their British and Spanish supporters were also offering freedom for slaves willing to fight for their cause, the commissioners outbid them by abolishing slavery in the north in August, and throughout the colony in October. Representatives were sent to Paris to gain the approval of the convention for the decision.\nThe Convention voted for the abolition of slavery in the colonies on 4 February 1794 and decreed that all residents of the colonies had the full rights of French citizens irrespective of colour. An army of 1,000 sans-culottes led by Victor Hugues was sent to Guadeloupe to expel the British and enforce the decree. The army recruited former slaves and eventually numbered 11,000, capturing Guadeloupe and other smaller islands. Abolition was also proclaimed on Guyane. Martinique remained under British occupation, while colonial landowners in R\u00e9union and the \u00celes Mascareignes repulsed the republicans. Black armies drove the Spanish out of Saint-Domingue in 1795, and the last of the British withdrew in 1798.\nIn republican controlled areas from 1793 to 1799, freed slaves were required to work on their former plantations or for their former masters if they were in domestic service. They were paid a wage and gained property rights. Black and coloured generals were effectively in control of large areas of Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue, including Toussaint Louverture in the north of Saint-Domingue, and Andr\u00e9 Rigaud in the south. Historian Fr\u00e9deric R\u00e9gent states that the restrictions on the freedom of employment and movement of former slaves meant that, \"only whites, persons of color already freed before the decree, and former slaves in the army or on warships really benefited from general emancipation.\"\nMedia and symbolism.\nNewspapers.\nNewspapers and pamphlets played a central role in stimulating and defining the Revolution. Prior to 1789, there have been a small number of heavily censored newspapers that needed a royal licence to operate, but the Estates General created an enormous demand for news, and over 130 newspapers appeared by the end of the year. Among the most significant were Marat's \"L'Ami du peuple\" and Elys\u00e9e Loustallot's \". Over the next decade, more than 2,000 newspapers were founded, 500 in Paris alone. Most lasted only a matter of weeks but they became the main communication medium, combined with the very large pamphlet literature.\nNewspapers were read aloud in taverns and clubs and circulated hand to hand. There was a widespread assumption that writing was a vocation, not a business, and the role of the press was the advancement of civic republicanism. By 1793 the radicals were most active but initially the royalists flooded the country with their publication the \" (Friends of the King) until they were suppressed.\nRevolutionary symbols.\nTo illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbols. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.\nLa Marseillaise.\n\" () became the national anthem of France. The song was written and composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, and was originally titled \". The French National Convention adopted it as the First Republic's anthem in 1795. It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille marching on the capital.\nThe song is the first example of the \"European march\" anthemic style, while the evocative melody and lyrics led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music. De Lisle was instructed to 'produce a hymn which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'\nGuillotine.\nThe guillotine remains \"the principal symbol of the Terror in the French Revolution.\" Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker, more efficient and more distinctive form of execution, the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory. It was celebrated on the left as the people's avenger, for example in the revolutionary song \"La guillotine permanente\", and cursed as the symbol of the Terror by the right.\nIts operation became a popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators. Vendors sold programmes listing the names of those scheduled to die. Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women (\"tricoteuses\") formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd. Parents often brought their children. By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically. Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored.\nCockade, \"tricolore\", and liberty cap.\nCockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789. They pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\". Camille Desmoulins asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms. Cockades with various colour schemes were used during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.\nThe Liberty cap, also known as the Phrygian cap, or pileus, is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. It reflects Roman republicanism and liberty, alluding to the Roman ritual of manumission, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty.\nRole of women.\nDeprived of political rights by the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", the Revolution initially allowed women to participate, although only to a limited degree. Activists included Girondists like Olympe de Gouges, author of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, and Charlotte Corday, killer of Marat. Others like Th\u00e9roigne de M\u00e9ricourt, Pauline L\u00e9on and the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women supported the Jacobins, staged demonstrations in the National Assembly and took part in the October 1789 March to Versailles. Despite this, the 1791 and 1793 constitutions denied them political rights and democratic citizenship.\nIn 1793, the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women campaigned for strict price controls on bread, and a law that would compel all women to wear the tricolour cockade. Although both demands were successful, in October the male-dominated Jacobins who then controlled the government denounced the Society as dangerous rabble-rousers and made all women's clubs and associations illegal. Organised women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after 30 October 1793.\nAt the same time, especially in the provinces, women played a prominent role in resisting social changes introduced by the Revolution. This was particularly so in terms of the reduced role of the Catholic Church; for those living in rural areas, closing of the churches meant a loss of normality. This sparked a counter-revolutionary movement led by women; while supporting other political and social changes, they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and revolutionary cults like the Cult of the Supreme Being. Olwen Hufton argues some wanted to protect the Church from heretical changes enforced by revolutionaries, viewing themselves as \"defenders of faith\".\nProminent women.\nOlympe de Gouges was an author whose publications emphasised that while women and men were different, this should not prevent equality under the law. In her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen she insisted women deserved rights, especially in areas concerning them directly, such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children. Along with other Girondists, she was executed in November 1793 during the Terror.\nMadame Roland, also known as Manon or Marie Roland, was another important female activist whose political focus was not specifically women but other aspects of the government. A Girondist, her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy; in addition, she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins, a political group which allowed women to join. She too was executed in November 1793.\nEconomic policies.\nThe Revolution abolished many economic constraints imposed by the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", including church tithes and feudal dues although tenants often paid higher rents and taxes. All church lands were nationalised, along with those owned by Royalist exiles, which were used to back paper currency known as assignats, and the feudal guild system eliminated. It also abolished the highly inefficient system of tax farming, whereby private individuals would collect taxes for a hefty fee. The government seized the foundations that had been set up (starting in the 13th century) to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals, poor relief, and education. The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation's charitable and school systems were massively disrupted.\nBetween 1790 and 1796, industrial and agricultural output dropped, foreign trade plunged, and prices soared, forcing the government to finance expenditure by issuing ever increasing quantities \"assignats\". When this resulted in escalating inflation, the response was to impose price controls and persecute private speculators and traders, creating a black market. Between 1789 and 1793, the annual deficit increased from 10% to 64% of gross national product, while annual inflation reached 3,500% after a poor harvest in 1794 and the removal of price controls. The assignats were withdrawn in 1796 but inflation continued until the introduction of the gold-based \"Franc germinal\" in 1803.\nImpact.\nThe French Revolution had a major impact on western history by ending feudalism in France and creating a path for advances in individual freedoms throughout Europe. The revolution represented the most significant challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world. Its impact on French nationalism was profound, while also stimulating nationalist movements throughout Europe. Some modern historians argue the concept of the nation state was a direct consequence of the revolution. As such, the revolution is often seen as marking the start of modernity and the modern period.\nFrance.\nThe long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarising politics for more than a century. Historian Fran\u00e7ois Aulard writes:\"From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.\"The revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church, although the two institutions survived. Hanson suggests the French underwent a fundamental transformation in self-identity, evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by intrinsic human rights. After the collapse of the First French Empire in 1815, the French public lost many of the rights and privileges earned since the revolution, but remembered the participatory politics that characterised the period. According to Paul Hanson, \"Revolution became a tradition, and republicanism an enduring option.\"\nThe Revolution meant an end to arbitrary royal rule and held out the promise of rule by law under a constitutional order. Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system and the restored Bourbons were forced to retain one. After the abdication of Napoleon III in 1871, the French Third Republic was launched with a deep commitment to upholding the ideals of the Revolution. The Vichy regime (1940\u20131944) tried to undo the revolutionary heritage but retained the republic. However, there were no efforts by the Bourbons, Vichy or any other government to restore the privileges that had been stripped away from the nobility in 1789. France permanently became a society of equals under the law.\nAgriculture was transformed by the Revolution. With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands, rural France became more a land of small independent farms. Harvest taxes were ended, such as the tithe and seigneurial dues. Primogeniture was ended both for nobles and peasants, thereby weakening the family patriarch, and led to a fall in the birth rate since all children had a share in the family property. Cobban argues the Revolution bequeathed to the nation \"a ruling class of landowners.\"\nEconomic historians are divided on the economic impact of the Revolution. One suggestion is the resulting fragmentation of agricultural holdings had a significant negative impact in the early years of 19th century, then became positive in the second half of the century because it facilitated the rise in human capital investments. Others argue the redistribution of land had an immediate positive impact on agricultural productivity, before the scale of these gains gradually declined over the course of the 19th century.\nIn the cities, entrepreneurship on a small scale flourished, as restrictive monopolies, privileges, barriers, rules, taxes and guilds gave way. However, the British blockade virtually ended overseas and colonial trade, hurting the cities and their supply chains. Overall, the Revolution did not greatly change the French business system, and probably helped freeze in place the horizons of the small business owner. The typical businessman owned a small store, mill or shop, with family help and a few paid employees; large-scale industry was less common than in other industrialising nations.\nEurope outside France.\nHistorians often see the impact of the Revolution as through the institutions and ideas exported by Napoleon. Economic historians Dan Bogart, Mauricio Drelichman, Oscar Gelderblom, and Jean-Laurent Rosenthal describe Napoleon's codified law as the French Revolution's \"most significant export.\" According to Daron Acemoglu, Davide Cantoni, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson the French Revolution had long-term effects in Europe. They suggest that \"areas that were occupied by the French and that underwent radical institutional reform experienced more rapid urbanization and economic growth, especially after 1850. There is no evidence of a negative effect of French invasion.\"\nThe Revolution sparked intense debate in Britain. The Revolution Controversy was a \"pamphlet war\" set off by the publication of \"A Discourse on the Love of Our Country\", a speech given by Richard Price to the Revolution Society on 4 November 1789, supporting the French Revolution. Edmund Burke responded in November 1790 with his own pamphlet, \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\", attacking the French Revolution as a threat to the aristocracy of all countries. William Coxe opposed Price's premise that one's country is principles and people, not the State itself.\nConversely, two seminal political pieces of political history were written in Price's favour, supporting the general right of the French people to replace their State. One of the first of these \"pamphlets\" into print was \"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\" by Mary Wollstonecraft . Wollstonecraft's title was echoed by Thomas Paine's \"Rights of Man\", published a few months later. In 1792 Christopher Wyvill published \"Defence of Dr. Price and the Reformers of England\", a plea for reform and moderation. This exchange of ideas has been described as \"one of the great political debates in British history\".\nIn Ireland, the effect was to transform what had been an attempt by Protestant settlers to gain some autonomy into a mass movement led by the Society of United Irishmen involving Catholics and Protestants. It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland, especially in Ulster. The upshot was a revolt in 1798, led by Wolfe Tone, that was crushed by Britain. German reaction to the Revolution swung from favourable to antagonistic. At first it brought liberal and democratic ideas, the end of guilds, serfdom and the Jewish ghetto. It brought economic freedoms and agrarian and legal reform. Above all the antagonism helped stimulate and shape German nationalism.\nFrance invaded Switzerland and turned it into the \"Helvetic Republic\" (1798\u20131803), a French puppet state. French interference with localism and traditions was deeply resented in Switzerland, although some reforms took hold and survived in the later period of restoration. France invaded and occupied the region now known as Belgium between 1794 and 1814. The new government enforced reforms, incorporating the region into France. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions.\nThe Kingdom of Denmark adopted liberalising reforms in line with those of the French Revolution. Reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organised liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century. The Constitution of Norway of 1814 was inspired by the French Revolution and was considered to be one of the most liberal and democratic constitutions at the time.\nNorth America.\nInitially, most people in the Province of Quebec were favourable toward the revolutionaries' aims. The Revolution took place against the background of an ongoing campaign for constitutional reform in the colony by Loyalist emigrants from the United States. Public opinion began to shift against the Revolution after the Flight to Varennes and further soured after the September Massacres and the subsequent execution of Louis XVI. French migration to the Canadas experienced a substantial decline during and after the Revolution. Only a limited number of artisans, professionals, and religious emigres were allowed to settle in the region during this period. Most emigres settled in Montreal or Quebec City. The influx of religious emigres also revitalised the local Catholic Church, with exiled priests establishing a number of parishes across the Canadas.\nIn the United States, the French Revolution deeply polarised American politics, and this polarisation led to the creation of the First Party System. In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the Democratic-Republican Party led by former American minister to France Thomas Jefferson favored revolutionary France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. George Washington and his unanimous cabinet, including Jefferson, decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war. Washington proclaimed neutrality instead.\nHistoriography.\nThe first writings on the French revolution were near contemporaneous with events and mainly divided along ideological lines. These included Edmund Burke's conservative critique Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) and Thomas Paine's response Rights of Man (1791). From 1815, narrative histories dominated, often based on first-hand experience of the revolutionary years. By the mid-nineteenth century, more scholarly histories appeared, written by specialists and based on original documents and a more critical assessment of contemporary accounts.\nDupuy identifies three main strands in nineteenth century historiography of the Revolution. The first is represented by reactionary writers who rejected the revolutionary ideals of popular sovereignty, civil equality, and the promotion of rationality, progress and personal happiness over religious faith. The second stream is those writers who celebrated its democratic, and republican values. The third were liberals like Germaine de Sta\u00ebl and Guizot, who accepted the necessity of reforms establishing a constitution and the rights of man, but rejected state interference with private property and individual rights, even when supported by a democratic majority.\nJules Michelet was a leading 19th-century historian of the democratic republican strand, and Thiers, Mignet and Tocqueville were prominent in the liberal strand. Hippolyte Taine's \"Origins of Contemporary France\" (1875\u20131894) was modern in its use of departmental archives, but Dupuy sees him as reactionary, given his contempt for the crowd, and Revolutionary values.\nThe broad distinction between conservative, democratic-republican and liberal interpretations of the Revolution persisted in the 20th-century, although historiography became more nuanced, with greater attention to critical analysis of documentary evidence. Alphonse Aulard (1849\u20131928) was the first professional historian of the Revolution; he promoted graduate studies, scholarly editions, and learned journals. His major work, \"The French Revolution, a Political History, 1789\u20131804\" (1905), was a democratic and republican interpretation of the Revolution.\nSocio-economic analysis and a focus on the experiences of ordinary people dominated French studies of the Revolution from the 1930s. Georges Lefebvre elaborated a Marxist socio-economic analysis of the revolution with detailed studies of peasants, the rural panic of 1789, and the behaviour of revolutionary crowds. Albert Soboul, also writing in the Marxist-Republican tradition, published a major study of the \"sans-culottes\" in 1958.\nAlfred Cobban challenged Jacobin-Marxist social and economic explanations of the revolution in two important works, \"The Myth of the French Revolution\" (1955) and \"Social Interpretation of the French Revolution\" (1964). He argued the Revolution was primarily a political conflict, which ended in a victory for conservative property owners, a result which retarded economic development.\nIn their 1965 work, \"La Revolution fran\u00e7aise\", Fran\u00e7ois Furet and Denis Richet also argued for the primacy of political decisions, contrasting the reformist period of 1789 to 1790 with the following interventions of the urban masses which led to radicalisation and an ungovernable situation.\nFrom the 1990s, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations of the revolution in terms of bourgeoisie-proletarian class struggle as anachronistic. However, no new explanatory model has gained widespread support. The historiography of the Revolution has expanded into areas such as cultural and regional histories, visual representations, transnational interpretations, and decolonisation."}

In his subsequent book \"Trust: Social Virtues and Creation of Prosperity\" (1995), he modified his earlier position to acknowledge that culture cannot be cleanly separated from economics. Fukuyama is also associated with the rise of the neoconservative movement, from which he has since distanced himself.\nFukuyama has been a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies since July 2010 and the Mosbacher Director of the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at Stanford University. In August 2019, he was named director of the Ford Dorsey Master's in International Policy at Stanford.\nBefore that, he served as a professor and director of the International Development program at the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University. He had also been the Omer L. and Nancy Hirst Professor of Public Policy at the School of Public Policy at George Mason University.\nHe is a council member of the International Forum for Democratic Studies founded by the National Endowment for Democracy and was a member of the Political Science Department of the RAND Corporation. He is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders. In 2024, he received the Riggs Award for Lifetime Achievement in International and Comparative Public Administration.\nEarly life and education.\nFrancis Fukuyama was born in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois, United States. His paternal grandfather fled the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 and started a shop on the west coast before being incarcerated in the Second World War. His father, Yoshio Fukuyama, a second-generation Japanese American, was trained as a minister in the Congregational Church, received a doctorate in sociology from the University of Chicago, and taught religious studies. His mother, Toshiko Kawata Fukuyama (), was born in Kyoto, Japan, and was the daughter of , founder of the Economics Department of Kyoto University and first president of Osaka City University. Francis, whose Japanese name is Yoshihiro, grew up in Manhattan as an only child, had little contact with Japanese culture, and did not learn Japanese. His family moved to State College, Pennsylvania, in 1967.\nFukuyama received his Bachelor of Arts degree in classics from Cornell University, where he studied political philosophy under Allan Bloom. He initially pursued graduate studies in comparative literature at Yale University, going to Paris for six months to study under Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida but became disillusioned and switched to political science at Harvard University. There, he studied with Samuel P. Huntington and Harvey Mansfield, among others. He earned his Ph.D. in political science at Harvard for his thesis on Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East. In 1979, he joined the global policy think tank RAND Corporation.\nFukuyama lived at the Telluride House and has been affiliated with the Telluride Association since his undergraduate years at Cornell. Telluride is an education enterprise that has been home to other significant leaders and intellectuals, including Steven Weinberg, Paul Wolfowitz and Kathleen Sullivan.\nFukuyama was the Omer L. and Nancy Hirst Professor of Public Policy in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University from 1996 to 2000. Until July 10, 2010, he was the Bernard L. Schwartz Professor of International Political Economy and Director of the International Development Program at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. He is now Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow and resident in the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, and director of the Ford Dorsey Master's in International Policy at Stanford.\nScholarship.\n\"The End of History and the Last Man\".\nFukuyama is best known as the author of \"The End of History and the Last Man\", in which he argued that the progression of human history as a struggle between ideologies was largely at an end, with the world settling on liberal democracy after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The book was an expansion on ideas expressed in an earlier article, \"The End of History?\" published in \"The National Interest\". In the article, Fukuyama predicted the coming global triumph of political and economic liberalism:\nAuthors such as Ralf Dahrendorf and Luciano Canfora argued in 1990 that the essay gave Fukuyama his 15 minutes of fame, which a slide into obscurity would soon follow. However, Fukuyama remained a relevant and cited public intellectual, which led American communitarian Amitai Etzioni to declare him \"one of the few enduring public intellectuals. They are often media stars who are eaten up and spat out after their 15 minutes. But he has lasted.\" Bernard Crick in his book titled \"Democracy\" spoke of Fukayama's principle of \"the end of the world\" as being a poor misreading of the historical processes involved in the development of modern democracy.\nAccording to Fukuyama, one of the main critiques of \"The End of History\" was of his aggressive stance toward postmodernism. In Fukuyama's opinion, postmodern philosophy undermined the ideology behind liberal democracy, leaving the Western world in a potentially weaker position. The fact that Marxism and fascism had proven untenable for practical use while liberal democracy still thrived was reason enough to embrace the hopeful attitude of the Progressive Era, as this hope for the future was what made a society worth struggling to maintain. Postmodernism, which, by this time, had become embedded in the cultural consciousness, offered no hope and nothing to sustain a necessary sense of community, instead relying only on lofty intellectual premises.\n\"The Origins of Political Order\".\nIn the 2011 book, Fukuyama describes what makes a state stable, using comparative political history to develop a theory of the stability of a political system. According to Fukuyama, an ideal political order needs a modern and effective state, the rule of law governing the state, and accountability.\n\"Political Order and Political Decay\".\nThe 2014 book is his second book on political order, following the 2011 book \"The Origins of Political Order\". In this book, Fukuyama covers events since the French Revolution and sheds light on political institutions and their development in different regions.\nAfter tracing how a modern and effective government was developed in the U.S., Fukuyama asserts that the country is experiencing political decay. Fukuyama believes that political decay can be seen in the deterioration of bureaucracies, special interest groups capturing the legislature, and inevitable but cumbersome judicial processes challenging all types of government action.\nOther works.\nFukuyama has written a number of other books, among them \"Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity\" and \"Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution\". In the latter, he qualified his original \"end of history\" thesis, arguing that since biotechnology increasingly allows humans to control their own evolution, it may allow humans to alter human nature, thereby putting liberal democracy at risk. One possible outcome could be that an altered human nature could end in radical inequality. He is a fierce enemy of transhumanism, an intellectual movement asserting that posthumanity is a desirable goal.\nIn another work, \"The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstruction of Social Order\", Fukuyama explores the origins of social norms and analyzes current disruptions in the fabric of human moral traditions. He considers these disruptions to arise from a shift from the manufacturing to the Information Age. This shift is, he thinks, normal and will prove self-correcting, given the intrinsic human need for social norms and rules.\nIn 2006, in \"America at the Crossroads,\" Fukuyama discusses the history of neoconservatism, with particular focus on its major tenets and political implications. He outlines his rationale for supporting the Bush Administration and where he believed it was going wrong at the time.\nIn 2008, Fukuyama published the book \"Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap Between Latin America and the United States\", which resulted from research and a conference funded by Grupo Mayan to gain an understanding of why Latin America, once far wealthier than North America, fell behind in terms of development in only a matter of centuries. Discussing this book at a 2009 conference, Fukuyama outlined his belief that inequality within Latin American nations impedes growth. He stated that an unequal distribution of wealth leads to social upheaval, resulting in stunted growth.\nIn 2018, in \"Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment\", Fukuyama enlists Plato's notion of thymos to understand the politics of grievance and resentment.\nAt the start of the following decade, he published some reflections on his work in the form of conversations under the title \"After the End of History\".\nIn 2022, Fukuyama published the book \"Liberalism and Its Discontents\", in which he defended liberalism from critics on the populist right and the progressive left. He also criticized neoliberalism and identity politics.\nPolitical views.\nNeoconservatism.\nAs a key Reagan Administration contributor to the formulation of the Reagan Doctrine, Fukuyama is an important figure in the rise of neoconservatism, although his works came out years after Irving Kristol's 1972 book crystallized neoconservatism. Fukuyama was active in the Project for the New American Century think tank starting in 1997, and as a member co-signed the organization's 1998 letter recommending that President Bill Clinton support Iraqi insurgencies in the overthrow of then-President of Iraq Saddam Hussein. He was also among forty co-signers of William Kristol's September 20, 2001 letter to President George W. Bush after the September 11, 2001 attacks that suggested the U.S. not only \"capture or kill Osama bin Laden\", but also embark upon \"a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq\".\nAs a supporter of the Iraq War Fukuyama defended the war against critics who accused the US of unilateralism and violating international law, saying \"Americans are right to insist that there is no such thing as an 'international community' in the abstract, and that nation-states must ultimately look out for themselves when it comes to critical matters of security\".\nIn a \"New York Times\" article from February 2006, Fukuyama, in considering the ongoing Iraq War, stated: \"What American foreign policy needs is not a return to a narrow and cynical realism, but rather the formulation of a 'realistic Wilsonianism' that better matches means to ends.\" In regard to neoconservatism, he went on to say: \"What is needed now are new ideas, neither neoconservative nor realist, for how America is to relate to the rest of the world \u2013 ideas that retain the neoconservative belief in the universality of human rights, but without its illusions about the efficacy of American power and hegemony to bring these ends about.\"\nCurrent views.\nFukuyama began to distance himself from the neoconservative agenda of the Bush administration, citing its excessive militarism and embrace of unilateral armed intervention, particularly in the Middle East. By mid-2004, Fukuyama had voiced his growing opposition to the Iraq War and called for Donald Rumsfeld's resignation as Secretary of Defense.\nAt an annual dinner of the American Enterprise Institute in February 2004, Dick Cheney and Charles Krauthammer declared the beginning of a unipolar era under American hegemony. \"All of these people around me were cheering wildly,\" Fukuyama remembers. He believes that the Iraq War was being blundered. \"All of my friends had taken leave of reality.\" He has not spoken to Paul Wolfowitz (previously a good friend) since.\nFukuyama declared he would not be voting for Bush, and that the Bush administration had made three mistakes:\nFukuyama believes the US has a right to promote its own values in the world, but more along the lines of what he calls \"realistic Wilsonianism\", with military intervention only as a last resort and only in addition to other measures. A latent military force is more likely to have an effect than actual deployment. The US spends 43% of global military spending, but Iraq shows there are limits to its effectiveness.\nThe US should instead stimulate political and economic development and gain a better understanding of what happens in other countries. The best instruments are setting a good example and providing education and, in many cases, money. The secret of development, be it political or economic, is that it never comes from outsiders, but always from people in the country itself. One thing the US proved to have excelled in during the aftermath of World War II was the formation of international institutions. A return to support for these structures would combine American power with international legitimacy, but such measures require a lot of patience. This is the central thesis of his 2006 work \"America at the Crossroads\".\nIn a 2006 essay in \"The New York Times Magazine\" strongly critical of the invasion, he identified neoconservatism with Leninism. He wrote that neoconservatives \"believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will. Leninism was a tragedy in its Bolshevik version, and it has returned as farce when practiced by the United States. Neoconservatism, as both a political symbol and a body of thought, has evolved into something I can no longer support.\"\nFukuyama announced the end of the neoconservative moment and argued for the demilitarization of the War on Terrorism:\nFukuyama endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 US presidential election. He states:\nIn 2007 Fukuyama criticized the American government's attitude to Iran, \"If the only thing we're putting on the table is that we'll talk to you, it isn't going to work. What the Iranians have really wanted over a long period of time is the grand bargain\". In 2009 he described Iran as \"not quite a tyranny, petty or grand\" but also not a liberal democracy and added that \"Iran could evolve towards a genuine rule-of-law democracy within the broad parameters of the 1979 constitution\".\nIn a 2018 interview with \"New Statesman\", when asked about his views on the resurgence of socialist politics in the United States and the United Kingdom, he responded:\nIn a review for \"The Washington Post\", Fukuyama discussed Ezra Klein's 2020 book \"Why We're Polarized\" regarding US politics, and outlined Klein's central conclusion about the importance of race and white identity to Donald Trump voters and Republicans.\nIn 2020, Fukuyama became the chair of the editorial board for \"American Purpose,\" a magazine established in 2020 to promote three central ideas. Firstly, it wants to promote liberal democracy in the United States. Secondly, it seeks to understand and opine on the challenges to liberal democracy in other countries. Thirdly, it wants to \"offer criticism and commentary on history and biography, high art and pop culture, science and technology.\"\nFukuyama has also perceived Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election as the result of the Western system's ability to correct mistakes. \nViews following Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nA few weeks after the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Fukuyama made several prognoses in the magazine \"American Purpose\":\nFukuyama has also put emphasis on the importance of national identity for a sound defense of liberal valuesand thus the need to reconcile the nation-state with liberal universalism, even if they seem at odds at firstin a \"Foreign Affairs\" article:\nLiberalism, with its universalist pretensions, may sit uneasily alongside seemingly parochial nationalism, but the two can be reconciled. The goals of liberalism are entirely compatible with a world divided into nation-states. ... Liberal rights are meaningless if they cannot be enforced by a state. ... The territorial jurisdiction of a state necessarily corresponds to the area occupied by the group of individuals who signed on to the social contract. People living outside that jurisdiction must have their rights respected, but not necessarily enforced, by that state. ... The need for international cooperation in addressing issues such as global warming and pandemics has never been more evident. But it remains the case that one particular form of power, the ability to enforce rules through the threat or the actual use of force, remains under the control of nation-states. . . Ultimate power, in other words, continues to be the province of nation-states, which means that the control of power at this level remains critical. ... There is thus no necessary contradiction between liberal universalism and the need for nation-states. Although the normative value of human rights may be universal, enforcement power is not; it is a scarce resource that is necessarily applied in a territorially delimited way.\nIn a 2022 interview with \"El Pa\u00eds\", Fukuyama expressed support for social democratic policies: \"In Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, you've had social democratic parties in power for a long time. [They've] done a lot of redistribution \u2013 you don't get this kind of polarized politics and you have an alternation between the center-left and center-right, which I think is much healthier.\" However, Fukuyama also said that he \"was never opposed to social democracy. I think that it really depends on the historical period and the degree of state intervention. By the 1960s, many social democratic societies had become mired in low growth [and] high inflation. At that point, I think it was important to roll some of that back. That is, in fact, what happened in Scandinavia. Most of those countries reduced tax rates, reduced levels of regulation and therefore became more productive. But I think that in the current period, we need more social democracy, especially in the United States.\"\nPersonal life.\nFukuyama is a part-time photographer. He also has an interest in early American furniture, which he reproduces by hand. Another hobby of Fukuyama's is sound recording and reproduction. He explained, \"These days I seem to spend as much time thinking about gear as I do analyzing politics for my day job.\" Since the mid-1990s, Fukuyama has been building his own personal computers.\nFukuyama is married to Laura Holmgren, whom he met when she was a University of California in Los Angeles graduate student after he started working for the RAND Corporation. He dedicated his book \"Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity\" to her. They live in California, with their three children, Julia, David, and John.\nHe is the first cousin to crime novelist Joe Ide. Fukuyama helped him get his first book published."}
{"id": "11195", "revid": "6908984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11195", "title": "Fingerspelling", "text": "Fingerspelling (or dactylology) is the representation of the letters of a writing system, and sometimes numeral systems, using only the hands. These manual alphabets (also known as finger alphabets or hand alphabets) have often been used in deaf education and have subsequently been adopted as a distinct part of a number of sign languages. There are about forty manual alphabets around the world. Historically, manual alphabets have had a number of additional applications\u2014including use as ciphers, as mnemonics and in silent religious settings.\nForms of manual alphabets.\nAs with other forms of manual communication, fingerspelling can be comprehended visually or tactually. The simplest visual form of fingerspelling is tracing the shape of letters in the air and the simplest tactual form is tracing them on the hand. Fingerspelling can be one-handed such as in American Sign Language, French Sign Language and Irish Sign Language, or it can be two-handed such as in British Sign Language.\nFingerspelling in sign languages.\nFingerspelling has been introduced into certain sign languages by educators and as such has some structural properties that are unlike the visually motivated and multi-layered signs that are typical in deaf sign languages. In many ways fingerspelling serves as a bridge between the sign language and the oral language that surrounds it.\nFingerspelling is used in different sign languages and registers for different purposes. It may be used to represent words from an oral language that have no sign equivalent or for emphasis or clarification or when teaching or learning a sign language.\nIn American Sign Language (ASL) more lexical items are fingerspelled in casual conversation than in formal or narrative signing. Different sign language speech communities use fingerspelling to a greater or lesser degree. At the high end of the scale fingerspelling makes up about 8.7% of casual signing in ASL and 10% of casual signing in Auslan. The proportion is higher in older signers. Across the Tasman Sea only 2.5% of the corpus of New Zealand Sign Language was found to be fingerspelling. Fingerspelling did not become a part of NZSL until the 1980s. Before that words could be spelled or initialised by tracing letters in the air. Fingerspelling does not seem to be used much in the sign languages of Eastern Europe except in schools, and Italian Sign Language is also said to use very little fingerspelling, and mainly for foreign words. Sign languages that make no use of fingerspelling at all include Kata Kolok and Ban Khor Sign Language.\nThe speed and clarity of fingerspelling also vary among different signing communities. In Italian Sign Language fingerspelled words are produced relatively slowly and clearly, whereas fingerspelling in standard British Sign Language (BSL) is often rapid so that the individual letters become difficult to distinguish and the word is grasped from the overall hand movement. Most of the letters of the BSL alphabet are produced with two hands but when one hand is occupied the dominant hand may fingerspell onto an imaginary subordinate hand and the word can be recognised by the movement. As with written words, the first and last letters and the length of the word are the most significant factors for recognition.\nWhen people fluent in sign language read fingerspelling they do not usually look at the signer's hand(s) but maintain eye contact, as is normal for sign language. People who are learning fingerspelling often find it impossible to understand it using just their peripheral vision and must look straight at the hand of someone who is fingerspelling. Often they must also ask the signer to fingerspell slowly. It frequently takes years of expressive and receptive practice to become skilled with fingerspelling.\nFamilies of manual alphabets in sign languages.\nPower et al. (2020) conducted a large-scale data study into the evolution and contemporary character of 76 current and defunct manual alphabets (MAs) of sign languages, postulating the existence of eight groups: an Afghan\u2013Jordanian Group, an Austrian-origin Group (with a Danish Subgroup), a British-origin Group, a French-origin Group, a Polish Group, a Russian Group, a Spanish Group, and a Swedish Group. Notably, several defunct versions of German, Austrian, Hungarian and Danish manual alphabets were part of the Austrian-origin group, while the current MAs of these sign languages are closely related to the French, American, International Sign and other MAs in the French-origin Group. Latvian Sign Language's MA dangled somewhere between the Polish and Russian Groups, Finnish Sign Language (which belongs to the Swedish Sign Language family) had a French-origin MA, while Indo-Pakistani Sign Language (whose lexicon and grammar have independent origins) currently used a two-handed manual alphabet of British origin.\nYoel (2009) demonstrated that American Sign Language is influencing the lexicon and grammar of Maritime Sign Language in various ways, including the fact that the original BANZSL two-handed manual alphabet is no longer used in the Maritimes and has been replaced by the one-handed American manual alphabet, which has been influencing lexicalisation. Although all participants in her survey had learnt and could still produce the BANZSL fingerspelling, they had difficulty doing so, and all participants indicated that it had been a long time since they last used it.\nOne-handed.\nTwo families of manual alphabets are used for representing the Latin alphabet in the modern world. The more common of the two is mostly produced on one hand and can be traced back to alphabetic signs used in Europe from at least the early 15th century.\nSome manual representations of non-Roman scripts such as Chinese, Japanese, Devanagari (e.g. the Nepali manual alphabet), Hebrew, Greek, Thai and Russian alphabets are based to some extent on the one-handed Latin alphabet described above. In some cases, however, the 'basis' is more theory than practice. Thus, for example, in the Japanese manual syllabary only the five vowels (\u30a2 /a/,\u3000\u30a4 /i/,\u3000\u30a6 /u/,\u3000\u30a8 /e/,\u3000\u30aa /o/) and the Ca (consonant plus \"a' vowel) letters (\u30ab /ka/, \u30b5 /sa/, \u30ca /na/, \u30cf /ha/, \u30de /ma/, \u30e4 /ya/, \u30e9 /ra/, \u30ef /wa/, but notably \"not\" \u30bf /ta/, which would resemble a somewhat rude gesture) derive from the American manual alphabet. In the Nepali Sign Language only four 'letters' derive from the American manual alphabet: \u0905 /a/, \u092c /b/, \u092e /m/, and \u0930 /r/).\nThe Yugoslav manual alphabet represents characters from the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet as well as Gaj's Latin alphabet.\nManual alphabets based on the Arabic alphabet, the Ethiopian Ge'ez script and the Korean Hangul script use handshapes that are more or less iconic representations of the characters in the writing system.\nTwo-handed.\nTwo-handed manual alphabets are used by a number of deaf communities; one such alphabet is shared by users of British Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language (collectively known as the BANZSL language family) and another is used in Turkish Sign Language. Some of the letters are represented by iconic shapes and in the BANZSL languages the vowels are represented by pointing to the fingertips.\nLetters are formed by a dominant hand, which is on top of or alongside the other hand at the point of contact, and a subordinate hand, which uses either the same or a simpler handshape as the dominant hand. Either the left or right hand can be dominant. In a modified tactile form used by deafblind people the signer's hand acts as the dominant hand and the receiver's hand becomes the subordinate hand.\nSome signs, such as the sign commonly used for the letter \"C\", may be one-handed.\nHistory of manual alphabets.\nLatin manual alphabet.\nSome writers have suggested that the body and hands were used to represent alphabets in Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Assyrian antiquity. Certainly, \"finger calculus\" systems were widespread, and capable of representing numbers up to 10,000; they are still in use today in parts of the Middle East. The practice of substituting letters for numbers and vice versa, known as gematria, was also common, and it is possible that the two practices were combined to produce a finger calculus alphabet. The earliest known manual alphabet, described by the Benedictine monk Bede in 8th century Northumbria, did just that. While the usual purpose of the Latin and Greek finger alphabets described by Bede is unknown, they were unlikely to have been used by deaf people for communication \u2014 even though Bede lost his own hearing later in life. Historian Lois Bragg concludes that these alphabets were \"only a bookish game.\"\nBeginning with R. A. S. Macalister in 1938, several writers have speculated that the 5th century Irish Ogham script, with its quinary alphabet system, was derived from a finger alphabet that predates even Bede.\nEuropean monks from at least the time of Bede have made use of forms of manual communication, including alphabetic gestures, for a number of reasons: communication among the monastery while observing vows of silence, administering to the ill, and as mnemonic devices. They also may have been used as ciphers for discreet or secret communication. Clear antecedents of many of the manual alphabets in use today can be seen from the 16th century in books published by friars in Spain and Italy. From the same time, monks such as the Benedictine Fray Pedro Ponce de Le\u00f3n began tutoring deaf children of wealthy patrons \u2014 in some places, literacy was a requirement for legal recognition as an heir \u2014 and the manual alphabets found a new purpose. They were originally part of the earliest known Mouth Hand Systems. The first book on deaf education, published in 1620 by Juan Pablo Bonet in Madrid, included a detailed account of the use of a manual alphabet to teach deaf students to read and speak.\nThis alphabet was adopted by the Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e's deaf school in Paris in the 18th century and then spread to deaf communities around the world in the 19th and 20th centuries via educators who had learned it in Paris. Over time variations have emerged, brought about by the natural phonetic changes that have occurred over time, adaptations for local written forms with special characters or diacritics (which are sometimes represented with the other hand) and avoidance of handshapes considered obscene in some cultures.\nMeanwhile, in Britain, manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes, such as secret communication, public speaking, or used for communication by deaf people. In 1648, John Bulwer described \"Master Babington\", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, \"contryved on the joynts of his fingers\", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of tactile signing. In 1680, George Dalgarno published \"Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor\", in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an arthropological alphabet. Charles de La Fin published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems. He described codes for both English and Latin.\nThe vowels of these early British manual alphabets, across the tips of the fingers, have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in British Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern two-handed alphabet appeared in 1698 with \"Digiti Lingua\", a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak. He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted."}

It is the first of several films by screenwriter Richard Curtis to star Hugh Grant, and follows the adventures of Charles (Grant) and his circle of friends through a number of social occasions as they each encounter romance. Andie MacDowell co-stars as Charles's love interest Carrie, with Kristin Scott Thomas, James Fleet, Simon Callow, John Hannah, Charlotte Coleman, David Bower, Corin Redgrave and Rowan Atkinson in supporting roles.\nThe film was made in six weeks, cost under \u00a33\u00a0million, and became an unexpected success and the highest-grossing British film in history at the time, with worldwide box office total of $245.7\u00a0million, and receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. Additionally, Grant won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the film won the BAFTA Awards' Best Film, Best Direction, and Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Scott Thomas. The film's success propelled Hugh Grant to international stardom, particularly in the United States.\nIn 1999, \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" was placed 23rd on the British Film Institute's 100 greatest British films of the 20th century. In 2016, \"Empire\" magazine ranked it 21st in their list of the 100 best British films. A 2017 poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for \"Time Out\" magazine ranked it the 74th-best British film ever.\nCurtis reunited director Newell and the surviving cast for a 25th-anniversary reunion Comic Relief short entitled \"One Red Nose Day and a Wedding\", which aired in the UK during Red Nose Day on 15 March 2019.\nPlot.\nOn 1 May 1993, at the wedding of Angus and Laura in Somerset, the perpetually late best man Charles, his flatmate Scarlett, his aristocratic friend Fiona and her brother Tom, Gareth and his partner Matthew, and Charles's deaf brother David, all gather. All are unmarried. Charles forgets the rings and hastily borrows two from the congregation, which prove to be incongruous. At the reception, he makes a risqu\u00e9 speech and is attracted to Carrie, an American woman who has been working in England. They spend the night together. In the morning, Carrie, who is returning to the U.S., laments to him that they may have \"missed a great opportunity\".\nThree months later, at the London wedding of Bernard and Lydia\u2014who got together at the previous wedding\u2014Tom is the best man. Charles is excited to run into Carrie, who has returned to the UK. He is disappointed to meet Hamish, Carrie's older, wealthy Scottish fianc\u00e9. A young woman named Serena is attracted to David.\nDuring the reception, Charles is humiliated by several ex-girlfriends. These include the distraught Henrietta, called \"Duckface\" by Fiona and whose brother was inadvertently insulted by Charles at the first wedding. Henrietta claims Charles is a \"serial monogamist\" fearful of commitment. Charles retreats to an empty hotel suite and sees Carrie and Hamish depart by taxi. Charles is temporarily trapped in the room when the newlyweds stumble in to have sex. Carrie returns to the reception; she and Charles spend a second night together.\nA month later, Charles receives an invitation to Carrie's wedding to Hamish. While searching for a gift on London's South Bank, he runs into Carrie. Charles helps Carrie choose a wedding dress, after which she recounts her 33 sexual partners to him; Charles, who was number 32, awkwardly confesses he loves her, and Carrie gently rebuffs him.\nA month later, Charles and his friends attend Carrie and Hamish's wedding in Perthshire. The flamboyant Gareth tells the group to seek potential mates. Scarlett meets Chester, a Texan. Henrietta points out her new boyfriend to Charles. As Charles watches Carrie and Hamish dance, Fiona, aware of Charles's unhappiness, tells him she remains single because she loves him. Charles, though sympathetic, does not reciprocate her feelings. During Hamish's speech, Gareth suffers a fatal heart attack.\nAt Gareth's funeral, Matthew recites \"Funeral Blues\", a poem by W. H. Auden. Carrie and Charles share a brief moment, and Charles and Tom then ponder that, despite their clique's pride in being single, Gareth and Matthew were as a \"married\" couple. They wonder whether seeking \"one true love\" is futile.\nTen months later, Charles's wedding day arrives; he is marrying Henrietta. While seating guests, Tom meets his distant cousin, Deirdre, whom he has not seen since childhood; they are smitten with each other. Scarlett and Chester are overjoyed to meet again.\nCarrie arrives and tells Charles she and Hamish separated following a difficult marriage. Charles has an emotional crisis in a back room of the church. After David and Matthew counsel him, he decides to proceed with the wedding. When the vicar asks whether anyone present has reason why the couple should not marry, David uses sign language to say the groom has doubts and loves someone else. Charles confirms this by saying \"I do\", and a furious Henrietta knocks him out at the altar, ending the ceremony.\nLater that day, Charles is at his flat discussing the fiasco with his friends when Carrie arrives to apologise for causing trouble. Charles again says he loves her and proposes a lifelong commitment without marriage, which Carrie accepts. As they kiss, a thunderbolt flashes across the sky.\nIn an ending photo montage, Henrietta has married an Army officer; David married Serena; Scarlett has married Chester, the Texan; Tom married Deirdre; Matthew has found a new male partner; Fiona is shown with Prince Charles; and Charles and Carrie have had their first child.\nProduction.\nWriting.\nScreenwriter Richard Curtis's own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\". According to Curtis, he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period. At one wedding he was propositioned by a fellow guest, but he turned her down and forever regretted it; accordingly, he based the origin of Charles and Carrie's romance on that situation.\nIt took Curtis 17 drafts to reach the final version. He initially planned the film as 'Four Weddings and a Honeymoon' but introduced the funeral theme on the advice of Helen Fielding. He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \"I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real. Every character, no matter how small, has a story, not just three funny lines. It's a romantic film about love and friendship that swims in a sea of jokes.\"\nCurtis chose to omit any mention of the characters' careers, because he did not think a group of friends would realistically discuss their jobs while together at a wedding.\nCasting.\nCurtis, Newell and the producers began the casting process for \"Four Weddings\" in early 1992. Alex Jennings was cast as Charles, but funding for the production fell through in mid-1992. Jennings would eventually go on to play a supporting role in Mindy Kaling's 2019 television miniseries adaptation of the film. The team continued holding auditions for over a year, seeing roughly 70 actors for the role of Charles before Hugh Grant.\nGrant was ready to give up acting as a career when he received the script for \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\"; he stated in 2016 that: \"I wasn't really getting any work at all, and then to my great surprise this script came through the letterbox from my agent, and it was really good. And I rang on and said there must be a mistake, you've sent me a good script.\" Initially, writer Richard Curtis, who had modelled the character of Charles after himself, was opposed to casting Grant in the role, because he thought Grant was too handsome. Curtis favoured casting Alan Rickman, but Rickman refused to audition. Curtis was eventually persuaded by Newell and the producers to approve Grant's casting.\nJeanne Tripplehorn was originally cast as Carrie, but she had to drop out before filming when her mother died. The role was offered to Marisa Tomei, but she turned it down, because her grandfather was sick at the time. Sarah Jessica Parker was also reportedly considered. Andie MacDowell was in London doing publicity for \"Groundhog Day\" when she read the script and was subsequently cast. MacDowell took a 75% cut in her fee to appear, receiving $250,000 upfront, but due to the success of the film, she earned around $3 million.\nGrant's participation hit another stumbling block when his agent requested a \u00a35,000 rise over the \u00a335,000 salary Grant was offered. The producers initially refused because of the extremely tight budget, but eventually agreed. The supporting cast members were paid \u00a317,500 apiece.\nProduction.\nDuncan Kenworthy produced the film while on sabbatical from Jim Henson Productions. Pre-production for the movie was a long process because funding was erratic, falling through in mid-1992 and leading to much uncertainty. Finally in early 1993, Working Title Films stepped in to close the gap. Nonetheless, another $1.2 million was cut just before production began in the summer of 1993, forcing the film to be made in just 36 days with a final budget of \u00a32.7 million (approximately $4.4 million in 1994). Channel Four Films contributed \u00a3800,000. The budget was so tight that extras had to wear their own wedding clothes, while Rowan Atkinson appeared as a vicar at two of the weddings so production would not have to pay another actor.\nFuture Home Secretary and Member of Parliament (MP) Amber Rudd was given the credit of \"Aristocracy Coordinator\" after she arranged for several aristocrats to make uncredited appearances as wedding extras, including Peregrine Cavendish, who was at the time Marquess of Hartington, and the Earl of Woolton, who conveniently wore their own morning suits.\nTo make Grant look more nerdy, the producers styled him with shaggy hair, glasses and deliberately unflattering, ill-fitting clothes. Grant was encouraged by director Mike Newell to mess up and trip over his lines, written in \"convoluted syntax\" as Grant describes them, in order to give Charles a stammering, nervous quality. Grant, who struggled with hay fever throughout filming, was unsure of Newell's direction and his own performance, which he thought was \"atrocious.\" Regarding Newell, Grant commented that: \"He seemed to be giving direction against what I thought were the natural beats of the comedy. He was making a film with texture, grounding it, playing the truths rather than the gags\".\nFilming locations.\nThe film was shot mainly in London and the Home Counties, including: Hampstead, Islington where the final moments take place on Highbury Terrace, Greenwich Hospital, Betchworth in Surrey, Amersham in Buckinghamshire, the village of Sarratt in Hertfordshire (wedding number one), St Bartholomew-the-Great church in London (wedding number four), and St Clement's Church, West Thurrock in Essex (the funeral). Exterior shots of guests arriving for the funeral were filmed in Thurrock, Essex overlooking the River Thames with the backdrop of the Dartford River Crossing and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge.\nStately homes in Bedfordshire (Luton Hoo for wedding two's reception) and Hampshire provided exteriors for weddings.\nPost-production.\nAccording to Hugh Grant, the initial screening of a rough cut of \"Four Weddings\" went very badly. \nThroughout production, Gramercy Pictures, the U.S. distributor for the film, sent frequent transatlantic faxes objecting to the explicit language and sexual content, fearing the final product would not be suitable for American distribution or television airings. They particularly objected to the opening scene of the movie, in which Charles and Scarlett say the word \"Fuck\" over and over, after an initial screening of the movie in Salt Lake City led the conservative Mormon members of the city council to walk out. Accordingly, Mike Newell and the actors agreed to reshoot the scene with the British swear word \"Bugger\" to be used in the American version. The executives also objected to the title, believing \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" would turn off male viewers from the film. In its place they suggested such titles as \"True Love and Near Misses\", \"Loitering in Sacred Places\", \"Skulking Around\" and \"Rolling in the Aisles\", none of which were accepted.\nMusic and soundtrack.\nThe original score was composed by British composer Richard Rodney Bennett. The movie also featured a soundtrack of popular songs, including a cover version of The Troggs' \"Love Is All Around\" performed by Wet Wet Wet that remained at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for fifteen weeks and was then the ninth biggest selling single of all time in Britain. This song would later be adapted into \"Christmas Is All Around\" and sung by the character of Billy Mack in Richard Curtis' 2003 film \"Love Actually\", in which Grant also stars. The soundtrack album sold more than 750,000 units.\nRelease.\n\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" had its world premiere in January 1994 at the Sundance Film Festival in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nIt opened in the United States on 11 March 1994 in five theatres. The box office receipts from the first five days of the film's general release in the United States so impressed the movie's distributor that it decided to spend lavishly on promotion, buying full-page newspaper ads and TV-spots totaling some $11 million. The movie also benefited from much free publicity because of Grant's reception in the United States, where he became an instant sex symbol and undertook a successful media tour promoting the film. Producer Duncan Kenworthy stated that \"It was the most amazing luck that when Hugh went on the publicity trail he turned out to be incredibly funny, and very like the character of Charles. That doesn't ever happen.\" The film had a wide release in the United States on 15 April 1994.\nAt the UK premiere in Leicester Square on 11 May 1994, Hugh Grant's then-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley garnered much publicity for the film when she wore a black Versace safety-pin dress which became a sensation in the press. The film opened in the UK on 13 May 1994.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" received critical acclaim. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critics consensus states, \"Hugh Grant ably snatches up the bouquet of leading man status with \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\", a sparkling romantic comedy given real charm by its chummy ensemble and Richard Curtis' sharp-witted screenplay.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \"delightful and sly\", and directed with \"light-hearted enchantment\" by Newell. He praised Grant's performance, describing it as a kind of \"endearing awkwardness\". Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" called it a \"truly beguiling romantic comedy\" which was \"frequently hilarious without being sappily sentimental or tiresomely retrograde.\" Producer Duncan Kenworthy later attributed much of the success of \"Four Weddings\" at the box office to McCarthy's review.\nWriting for the \"Chicago Reader\", Jonathan Rosenbaum called the film \"generic\" and \"standard issue\", stating that the audience should not \"expect to remember it ten minutes later\". \"Time\" magazine writer Richard Corliss was less scathing, but agreed that it was forgettable, saying that people would \"forget all about [the movie] by the time they leave the multiplex,\" even joking at the end of his review that he had forgotten the film's name.\nBox office.\nUpon its limited release in the United States, \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" opened with $138,486 from five theatres. In its wide release, the film topped the box office with $4.2 million. The film would go on to gross $52.7 million in the United States and Canada.\nIn the United Kingdom, the film grossed \u00a31.4 million in its opening weekend, a record for a UK production, and \u00a32.7 million in its opening week from 211 theatres. It was number one for nine consecutive weeks, grossing \u00a327.8 million, making it the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United Kingdom behind \"Jurassic Park\". It surpassed \"A Fish Called Wanda\" as the highest-grossing British film. In France, it was number one at the box office for ten weeks, grossing $34.4 million. It was also number one at the Australian box office for five weeks and was the second-highest-grossing film of the year, grossing $A21.4 million. Overall, it grossed $245.7 million worldwide, generating the highest percentage return on cost of films released in 1994. The success of the film cleared Working Title's past losses and generated over $50 million for Polygram, clearing most of their losses in the four years since they started producing films.\nRecognition.\nThe film was voted the 27th-greatest comedy film of all time by readers of \"Total Film\" in 2000. In 2004, the same magazine named it the 34th-greatest British film of all time. It is number 96 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\".\n\"The Guardian\", in a 20th-anniversary retrospective of \"Four Weddings\", stated that \"Its influence on the British film industry, on romantic-comedy writing, on the pop charts, on funeral readings, on \"haircuts\", was enormous.\"\nHugh Grant commented in 2016 on the experience of the film's phenomenal success and its effect on his career: \"I was making \"An Awfully Big Adventure\" at the time that \"Four Weddings\" came out, with Mike Newell again, same director, even tinier budget, in Dublin. And we'd get back from brutal days on the set, very long and no money, and the fax machines...were coming out saying that now your film \"Four Weddings\" is #5 in America, now it's #3, now it's #1 and here's an offer Hugh, for \"Captain Blood\" and they'll pay you $1 million. It was completely surreal.\"\nFranchise.\nHulu anthology television miniseries.\nIt was reported in November 2017 that the streaming service Hulu was developing an eponymous anthology television series based upon the film, to be written and executive produced by Mindy Kaling and Matt Warburton, with Richard Curtis also serving as an executive producer. In October 2018, it was announced Jessica Williams, Nikesh Patel, Rebecca Rittenhouse and John Reynolds had joined the cast. The miniseries premiered on 31 July 2019.\n\"One Red Nose Day and a Wedding\".\nOn 5 December 2018, it was announced that Richard Curtis had written \"One Red Nose Day and a Wedding\", a 25th-anniversary Comic Relief television reunion short film. The original film's director, Mike Newell, returned, along with the film's surviving cast, including Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Kristin Scott Thomas, John Hannah, Rowan Atkinson, James Fleet, David Haig, Sophie Thompson, David Bower, Robin McCaffrey, Anna Chancellor, Rupert Vansittart, Simon Kunz, Sara Crowe and Timothy Walker. It was filmed on 13\u201314 December 2018 at St James' Church, Islington, London. It centered on the reunion of all the characters from the original film at the wedding of Charles and Carrie's daughter to Fiona's daughter. The involvement of additional cast members Lily James and Alicia Vikander, who played the young lesbians getting married, was not announced until the day the film aired in the UK. The film aired in the U.S. on their Red Nose Day on 23 May 2019."}

{"id": "11225", "revid": "30292728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11225", "title": "Ferrari", "text": "Ferrari S.p.A. (; ) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898\u20131988), the company built its first car in 1940, adopted its current name in 1945, and began to produce its current line of road cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016. The company currently offers a large model range which includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction. \nThroughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where its team, Scuderia Ferrari, is the series' single oldest and most successful. Scuderia Ferrari has raced since 1929, first in Grand Prix events and later in Formula One, where it holds many records. Historically, Ferrari was also highly active in sports car racing, where its cars took many wins in races such as the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as several overall victories in the World Sportscar Championship. Scuderia Ferrari fans, commonly called , are known for their passion and loyalty to the team.\nFerrari is one of the world's strongest brands, and it maintains a brand image built around racing heritage, luxury, and exclusivity. As of May 2023, Ferrari is also one of the largest car manufacturers by market capitalisation, with a value of approximately US$85.5 billion.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nEnzo Ferrari, formerly a salesman and racing driver for Alfa Romeo, founded Scuderia Ferrari, a racing team, in 1929. Originally intended to service gentleman drivers and other amateur racers, Alfa Romeo's withdrawal from racing in 1933, combined with Enzo's connections within the company, turned Scuderia Ferrari into its unofficial representative on the track. Alfa Romeo supplied racing cars to Ferrari, who eventually amassed some of the best drivers of the 1930s and won many races before the team's liquidation in 1937.\nLate in 1937, Scuderia Ferrari was liquidated and absorbed into Alfa Romeo, but Enzo's disagreements with upper management caused him to leave in 1939. He used his settlement to found his own company, where he intended to produce his own cars. He called the company \"Auto Avio Costruzioni\", and headquartered it in the facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari; due to a noncompete agreement with Alfa Romeo, the company could not use the Ferrari name for another four years. The company produced a single car, the Auto Avio Costruzioni 815, which participated in only one race before the outbreak of World War II. During the war, Enzo's company produced aircraft engines and machine tools for the Italian military; the contracts for these goods were lucrative, and provided the new company with a great deal of capital. In 1943, under threat of Allied bombing raids, the company's factory was moved to Maranello. Though the new facility was nonetheless bombed twice, Ferrari remains in Maranello to this day.\nUnder Enzo Ferrari.\nIn 1945, Ferrari adopted its current name. Work started promptly on a new V12 engine that would power the 125 S, which was the marque's first car, and many subsequent Ferraris. The company saw success in motorsport almost as soon as it began racing: the 125 S won many races in 1947, and several early victories, including the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans and 1951 Carrera Panamericana, helped build Ferrari's reputation as a high-quality automaker. Ferrari won several more races in the coming years, and early in the 1950s its road cars were already a favourite of the international elite. Ferrari produced many families of interrelated cars, including the America, Monza, and 250 series, and the company's first series-produced car was the 250 GT Coup\u00e9, beginning in 1958.\nIn 1960, Ferrari was reorganized as a public company. It soon began searching for a business partner to handle its manufacturing operations: it first approached Ford in 1963, though negotiations fell through; later talks with Fiat, who bought 50% of Ferrari's shares in 1969, were more successful. In the second half of the decade, Ferrari also produced two cars that upended its more traditional models: the 1967 Dino 206 GT, which was its first mass-produced mid-engined road car, and the 1968 365 GTB/4, which possessed streamlined styling that modernised Ferrari's design language. The Dino in particular was a decisive movement away from the company's conservative engineering approach, where every road-going Ferrari featured a V12 engine placed in the front of the car, and it presaged Ferrari's full embrace of mid-engine architecture, as well as V6 and V8 engines, in the 1970s and 1980s.\nContemporary.\nEnzo Ferrari died in 1988, an event that saw Fiat expand its stake to 90%. The last car that he personally approved\u2014the F40\u2014expanded on the flagship supercar approach first tried by the 288 GTO four years earlier. Enzo was succeeded in 1991 by Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, under whose 23-year-long chairmanship the company greatly expanded. Between 1991 and 2014, he increased the profitability of Ferrari's road cars nearly tenfold, both by increasing the range of cars offered and through limiting the total number produced. Montezemolo's chairmanship also saw an expansion in licensing deals, a drastic improvement in Ferrari's Formula One performance (not least through the hiring of Michael Schumacher and Jean Todt), and the production of three more flagship cars: the F50, the Enzo, and the LaFerrari. In addition to his leadership of Ferrari, Montezemolo was also the chairman of Fiat proper between 2004 and 2010.\nAfter Montezemolo resigned, he was replaced in quick succession by many new chairmen and CEOs. He was succeeded first by Sergio Marchionne, who would oversee Ferrari's initial public offering and subsequent spin-off from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and then by Louis Camilleri as CEO and John Elkann as chairman. Beginning in 2021, Camilleri was replaced as CEO by Benedetto Vigna, who has announced plans to develop Ferrari's first fully electric model. During this period, Ferrari has expanded its production, owing to a global increase in wealth, while becoming more selective with its licensing deals.\nMotorsport.\nSince the company's beginnings, Ferrari has been involved in motorsport. Through its works team, Scuderia Ferrari, it has competed in a range of categories including Formula One and sports car racing, though the company has also worked in partnership with other teams.\nGrand Prix and Formula One racing.\nScuderia Ferrari has been continuously active since the very beginning of Formula One, and is one of its most illustrious teams: since 1952 it has fielded fifteen champion drivers, won sixteen Constructors' Championships, and accumulated more race victories, 1\u20132 finishes, podiums, pole positions, fastest laps and points than any other team in F1 history.\nThe earliest Ferrari entity, Scuderia Ferrari, was created in 1929\u2014ten years before the founding of Ferrari proper\u2014as a Grand Prix racing team. It was affiliated with automaker Alfa Romeo, for whom Enzo had worked in the 1920s. Alfa Romeo supplied racing cars to Ferrari, which the team then tuned and adjusted to their desired specifications. Scuderia Ferrari was highly successful in the 1930s: between 1929 and 1937 the team fielded such top drivers as Antonio Ascari, Giuseppe Campari, and Tazio Nuvolari, and won 144 out of its 225 races.\nFerrari returned to Grand Prix racing in 1947, which was at that point metamorphosing into modern-day Formula One. The team's first homebuilt Grand Prix car, the 125 F1, was first raced at the 1948 Italian Grand Prix, where its encouraging performance convinced Enzo to continue the company's costly Grand Prix racing programme. Ferrari's first victory in an F1 series was at the 1951 British Grand Prix, heralding its strong performance during the 1950s and early 1960s: between 1952 and 1964, the team took home six World Drivers' Championships and one Constructors' Championship. Notable Ferrari drivers from this era include Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Phil Hill, and John Surtees.\nFerrari's initial fortunes ran dry after 1964, and its began to receive its titles in isolated sprees. Ferrari first started to slip in the late 1960s, when it was outclassed by teams using the inexpensive, well-engineered Cosworth DFV engine. The team's performance improved markedly in the mid-1970s thanks to Niki Lauda, whose skill behind the wheel granted Ferrari a drivers' title in 1975 and 1977; similar success was accomplished in following years by the likes of Jody Scheckter and Gilles Villeneuve. The team also won the Constructors' Championship in 1982 and 1983.\nFollowing another drought in the 1980s and 1990s, Ferrari saw a long winning streak in the 2000s, largely through the work of Michael Schumacher. After signing onto the team in 1996, Schumacher gave Ferrari five consecutive drivers' titles between 2000 and 2004; this was accompanied by six consecutive constructors' titles, beginning in 1999. Ferrari was especially dominant in the 2004 season, where it lost only three races. After Schumacher's departure, Ferrari won one more drivers' title\u2014given in 2007 to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen\u2014and two constructors' titles in 2007 and 2008. These are the team's most recent titles to date; as of late, Ferrari has struggled to outdo recently ascendant teams such as Red Bull and Mercedes-Benz.\nFerrari Driver Academy.\nFerrari's junior driver programme is the Ferrari Driver Academy. Begun in 2009, the initiative follows the team's successful grooming of Felipe Massa between 2003 and 2006. Drivers who are accepted into the Academy learn the rules and history of formula racing as they compete, with Ferrari's support, in feeder classes such as Formula Three and Formula 4. As of 2019, 5 out of 18 programme inductees had graduated and become F1 drivers: one of these drivers, Charles Leclerc, came to race for Scuderia Ferrari, while the other four signed to other teams. Non-graduate drivers have participated in racing development, filled consultant roles, or left the Academy to continue racing in lower-tier formulae.\nSports car racing.\nAside from an abortive effort in 1940, Ferrari began racing sports cars in 1947, when the 125 S won six out of the ten races it participated in. Ferrari continued to see similar luck in the years to follow: by 1957, just ten years after beginning to compete, Ferrari had won three World Sportscar Championships, seven victories in the Mille Miglia, and two victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, among many other races. These races were ideal environments for the development and promotion of Ferrari's earlier road cars, which were broadly similar to their racing counterparts.\nThis luck continued into the first half of the 1960s, when Ferrari won the WSC's 2000GT class three consecutive times and finished first at Le Mans for six consecutive years. Its winning streak at Le Mans was broken by Ford in 1966, and though Ferrari would win two more WSC titles\u2014one in 1967 and another in 1972\u2014poor revenue allocation, combined with languishing performance in Formula One, led the company to cease competing in sports car events in 1973. From that point onward, Ferrari would help prepare sports racing cars for privateer teams, but would not race them itself.\nIn 2023, Ferrari reentered prototype sports car racing. For the 2023 FIA World Endurance Championship, Ferrari, in partnership with AF Corse, fielded two 499P sports prototypes. To commemorate the company's return to the discipline, one of the cars was numbered \"50\", referencing the fifty years that had elapsed since a works Ferrari competed in an endurance race. The 499P finished first at the 2023 24 Hours of Le Mans, ending Toyota Gazoo Racing's five-year winning streak there and becoming the first Ferrari in 58 years to win the race. Ferrari repeated this feat at the 2024 24 Hours of Le Mans, marking its first consecutive victory at the race since 1965.\nOther disciplines.\nFrom 1932 to 1935 Scuderia Ferrari operated a motorcycle racing division, which was conceived as a way to scout and train future Grand Prix drivers. Instead of Italian motorcycles, the team used British ones manufactured by Norton and Rudge. Though Ferrari was successful on two wheels, winning three national titles and 44 overall victories, it was eventually pushed out of the discipline both by the obsolescence of pushrod motorcycle engines and broader economic troubles stemming from the Great Depression.\nFerrari formerly participated in a variety of non-F1 open-wheel series. As early as 1948, Ferrari had developed cars for Formula Two and Formula Libre events, and the company's F2 programme led directly to the creation of the Dino engine, which came to power various racing and road Ferraris. The final non-F1 formula in which Ferrari competed was the Tasman Series, wherein Chris Amon won the 1969 championship in a Dino 246 Tasmania.\nAt least two water speed record boats have utilized Ferrari powertrains, both of them 800kg-class hydroplanes from the early 1950s. Neither boat was built by or affiliated with Ferrari, though one of them, \"Arno XI\", had its engine order approved directly by Enzo Ferrari. \"Arno XI\" still holds the top speed record for an 800kg hydroplane.\nSince 2019, Scuderia Ferrari has participated in sim racing.\nRace cars for other teams.\nThroughout its history, Ferrari has supplied racing cars to other entrants, aside from its own works Scuderia Ferrari team. In the 1950s and 1960s, Ferrari supplied Formula One cars to a number of private entrants and other teams. One famous example was Tony Vandervell's team, which raced the Thinwall Special modified Ferraris before building their own Vanwall cars. The North American Racing Team's entries in the final three rounds of the 1969 season were the last occasions on which a team other than Scuderia Ferrari entered a World Championship Grand Prix with a Ferrari car.\nFerrari supplied cars complete with V8 engines for the A1 Grand Prix series, from the 2008\u20132009 season. The car was designed by Rory Byrne and is styled to resemble the 2004 Ferrari Formula one car. Ferrari currently runs a customer GT program for a racing version of its 458 and has done so for the 458's predecessors, dating back to the 355 in the late 1990s. Such private teams as the American Risi Competizione and Italian AF Corse teams have been very successful with Ferrari GT racers over the years. This car, made for endurance sportscar racing to compete against such racing versions of the Audi R8, McLaren MP4-12C, and BMW Z4 (E89) has proven to be successful, but not as successful as its predecessor, the F430. The Ferrari Challenge is a one-make racing series for the Ferrari 458. The FXX is not road legal and is therefore only used for track events.\nRoad cars.\nThe first vehicle made with the Ferrari name was the 125 S. Only two of this small two-seat sports/racing V12 car were made. In 1949, the 166 Inter was introduced marking the company's significant move into the grand touring road car market. The first 166 Inter was a four-seat (2+2) berlinetta coupe with body work designed by Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera. Road cars quickly became the bulk of Ferrari sales. The early Ferrari road cars typically featured bodywork designed and customised by independent coachbuilders such as Vignale, Touring, Ghia, Pininfarina, Scaglietti and Bertone.\nThe original Ferrari road cars were typically two-seat front-engined V12s. This platform served Ferrari well through the 1950s and 1960s. In 1967, the V6 powered Dino 206 GT was introduced as the first production rear mid-engined car built by Ferrari. The 206 GT was sold under the lower cost Dino marque, named after Enzo Ferrari's late son, and sold in greater numbers than any previous Ferrari model. The first rear mid-engine model to be sold under the Ferrari name came in 1973 with the flat 12 powered Berlinetta Boxer. This rear mid-engine layout would go on to be used in many Ferraris continuing into the present day. Current Ferrari road cars typically use V8 or V12 engines, with V8 models making up over half of the marque's total production. \nFor a time, Ferrari built 2+2 versions of its mid-engined V8 cars. Although they looked quite different from their 2-seat counterparts, both the GT4 and Mondial were closely related to the 308 GTB.\nThe company has also produced several front-engined 2+2 cars, culminating in the recent V12 model Lusso and V8 models Roma, Portofino and Lusso T. The California is credited with initiating the current model line of V8 front-engined 2+2 grand touring performance sports cars.\nStarting in the early 2010s with the LaFerrari, Ferrari shifted its focus away from using independent coachbuilders, including Pininfarina, to instead relying on in-house design from the Centro Stile Ferrari for the design of all its road cars. The Ferrari F12 was the last Ferrari production model to feature Pininfarina design, although Ferrari has stated that they will continue to collaborate with Pininfarina on special projects.\nThe Ferrari SF90 Stradale is the first-ever Ferrari to feature PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) architecture which sees the internal combustion engine integrated with three electric motors, two of which are independent and located on the front axle, with the third at the rear between the engine and the gearbox.\nIn February 2025, Ferrari announced that they would be unveiling their first-ever fully electric car in October, \"in a unique and innovative way\", according to CEO Benedetto Vigna.\nCustomisation.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, clients often personalized their vehicles as they came straight from the factory. This philosophy added to the mystique of the brand at the time. Every Ferrari that came out of Maranello could be built to an individual customer's specification.\nFerrari formalized this concept with its earlier Carrozzeria Scaglietti programme. The options offered here were more typical such as racing seats, rearview cameras, and other special trim. In late 2011, Ferrari announced a significant update of this philosophy. The Tailor Made programme allows clients to work with designers in Maranello to make decisions at every step of the process. Through this program almost any trim, any exterior colour or any interior material is possible. The program carries on the original tradition and emphasizes the idea of each car being unique.\n\"Big 6\" supercars.\nThe 1984 288 GTO is considered by some to be the first in the line of Ferrari flagship \"supercars\". This pedigree is considered to extend through the F40, F50, Enzo, LaFerrari, and the F80. These are sometimes referred to by collectors as the \"Big 6\".\nConcept cars and specials.\nFerrari has produced a handful of concept cars such as the Modulo, Mythos, and Pinin. Some of these were quite radical and never intended for production, while others showed styling elements that were later incorporated into production models. Most of Ferrari's concept cars have been collaborations with design studio Pininfarina. The most recent concept car to be produced by Ferrari themselves was the 2010 Millechili.\nA number of one-off special versions of Ferrari road cars have also been produced, commissioned to coachbuilders by wealthy owners. Examples include the P4/5 and the 612 Kappa.\nFerrari Special Projects.\nThe Special Projects programme, also called the Portfolio Coachbuilding Programme, was launched in 2008 as a way to revive the tradition of past one-off and limited production coachbuilt Ferrari models, allowing clients to work with Ferrari and top Italian coachbuilders to create bespoke bodied models based on modern Ferrari road cars. Engineering and design is done by Ferrari, sometimes in cooperation with external design houses such as Pininfarina or Fioravanti, and the vehicles receive full homologation to be road legal. Since the creation of Ferrari's in-house styling centre in 2010 though, the focus has shifted away somewhat from outside coachbuilders and more towards creating new in-house designs for clients.\nThe first car to be completed under this programme was the 2008 SP1, commissioned by a Japanese business executive. The second was the P540 Superfast Aperta, commissioned by an American collector. The following is a list of Special Projects cars that have been made public:\nBio-fuel and hybrid cars.\nAn F430 Spider that runs on ethanol was displayed at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show. At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Ferrari unveiled a hybrid version of their flagship 599. Called the \"HY-KERS Concept\", Ferrari's hybrid system adds more than 100 horsepower on top of the 599 Fiorano's 612\u00a0hp. Also in mid-2014, the flagship LaFerrari was put into production featuring a hybrid system. Ferrari introduced their first plug-in hybrid (PHEV) model in 2019 with the SF90 Stradale, followed by the 296 in 2021.\nNaming conventions.\nFrom the beginning, the Ferrari naming convention consisted of a three-digit unitary displacement of an engine cylinder with an additional suffix representing the purpose of a vehicle. Therefore, Ferrari 125 S had V12 engine with a unitary displacement of 124.73 cc; whilst S-suffix represented Sport. Other race cars also received names invoking particular races such as Ferrari 166 MM for Mille Miglia. With the introduction of road-going models, the suffix Inter was added, inspired by the Scuderia Inter racing team of Igor Troubetzkoy. Popular at that time 166-series had engines with 166.25 cc of unitary displacement and a very diverse 250-series had of total displacement and 246.10 cc of unitary. Later series of road cars were renamed Europa and top-of-the-line series America and Superamerica.\nUntil the early 1990s, Ferrari followed a three-number naming scheme based on engine displacement and a number of cylinders:\nMost Ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style. In general, the following conventions were used:\nThis naming system can be confusing, as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style. Many Ferraris also had other names affixed (such as Daytona) to identify them further. Many such names are not official factory names. The Daytona name commemorates Ferrari's triple success in the February 1967 24 Hours of Daytona with the 330 P4. Only in the 1973 Daytona 24 Hours, a 365 GTB/4 run by NART (who raced Ferraris in America) ran second, behind a Porsche 911.\nThe various Dino models were named for Enzo's son, Dino Ferrari, and were marketed as Dinos by Ferrari and sold at Ferrari dealersfor all intents and purposes they are Ferraris.\nIn the mid-1990s, Ferrari added the letter \"F\" to the beginning of all models (a practice abandoned after the F512 M and F355, but adopted again with the F430, but not with its successor, the Ferrari 458).\nIdentity.\nThe \"Prancing Horse\".\nFerrari's symbol is the \"Prancing Horse\" (, ), a prancing black horse on a yellow background. Minor details of its appearance have changed many times, but its shape has remained consistent: it is always presented either as a shield, with the Italian tricolour above the horse and the initials \"SF\" (\"Scuderia Ferrari\") below; or as a rectangle, replacing \"SF\" with the word \"Ferrari\" rendered in the company's trademark typeface.\nEnzo Ferrari offered an account of the horse's origins. In his story, after a 1923 victory in Ravenna, the family of Francesco Baracca, a deceased flying ace who painted the emblem on his airplane, paid him a visit. Paolina de Biancoli, Francesco's mother, suggested that Ferrari adopt the horse as a good luck charm: he accepted the request, and the Prancing Horse was first used by his racing team in 1932, applied to their Alfa Romeo 8C with the addition of a canary yellow background\u2014the \"colour of Modena\", Enzo's hometown. The rectangular Prancing Horse has been used since 1947, when the Ferrari 125 S\u2014also the first Ferrari-branded sports car\u2014became the first to wear it.\nColour.\nFor many years, () was the required colour of all Italian racing cars. It is also closely associated with Ferrari: even after livery regulations changed, allowing race teams to deviate from their national colours, Scuderia Ferrari continued to paint its cars bright red, as it does to this day. On Ferrari's road-going cars, the colour has always been among the company's most popular choices: in 2012, 40 per cent of Ferraris left the factory painted red, while in the early 1990s the figure was even higher, at 85 per cent. Some Ferrari vehicles, such as the 288 GTO, have only been made available in red.\nAlthough rosso corsa is the colour most associated with Ferrari, it has not always been the colour of choice. Ferraris raced by privateers have run in a rainbow of colours, and one 250 GT SWB, used as a test mule for the 250 GTO, was a rare non-red factory-backed car: it raced in blue. In a particularly noteworthy case from 1964, while protesting the FIA's homologation requirements, the company moved its racing assets to the North American Racing Team, an affiliated team based in the United States. As a result, Ferrari and the driver John Surtees won the 1964 Formula One season in American colours\u2014blue, with a white racing stripe. By the early 2010s, red had also become less common on Ferrari's road cars, fighting with newly popular colours such as yellow, silver, and white.\nSpeaking to both the popularity of rosso corsa and the power of the Ferrari brand, Enzo Ferrari is reported to have once said the following: \"Ask a child to draw a car, and he will certainly paint it red.\"\nBrand image.\nDescribed by the \"Wall Street Journal\" as \"synonymous with opulence, meticulous craftsmanship and ridiculously fast cars for nearly a century\", Ferrari possesses a robust and powerful brand image. Owing to a combination of its cars, enthusiast culture, and successful licensing deals, in 2019 Ferrari was labelled the world's strongest brand by the financial consultancy Brand Finance.\nFerrari meticulously manages its brand image and public perception: it goes to great lengths to protect its trademarks, and its customers are expected to honour its rules and guidelines when caring for their cars. The company is noted for its frequent and diverse lawsuits, which have centred around such subjects as the shape of the Ferrari 250 GTO's bodywork, exclusive rights to model names (including \"Testarossa\" and \"Purosangue\"), replica vehicles, and several unsanctioned owner modifications. Via a bounty system, individuals may receive rewards for reporting counterfeit Ferrari products to the company.\nFerrari aims to cultivate an image of exclusivity and refined luxury. To facilitate this, vehicle production is deliberately limited to below customer demand, and purchasers are internally ranked based on their desirability and loyalty. Some cars may only be purchased by customers who have already owned multiple Ferraris, and the company's most exclusive supercars, such as the LaFerrari, have wait lists many times in excess of total production, with only the most loyal customers selected to purchase one. In 2015, the company's head of sales stated that the purpose of this strategy was to maintain the brand's value, and to \"keep alive this dream that is called Ferrari\".\nSometimes, Ferrari's desire to maintain its brand perception goes against the wishes of its clientele. In one case, the company sued the fashion designer Philipp Plein over \"distasteful\" Instagram posts featuring his personal 812 Superfast. The posts, which showcased two models in suggestive positions atop the car, were seen by Ferrari as \"unlawfully appropriating\" the Ferrari brand to promote Plein's clothing, and as being outside Ferrari's intended brand perception. Furthermore, the company places restrictions on what owners may do with their cars: they are not allowed to undertake certain modifications, and the company's right of first refusal contract, designed to discourage speculation and flipping, prohibits unauthorised sales within the first two years of ownership. Purchasers who break these rules are placed on a \"blacklist\", and may not be permitted to buy a Ferrari vehicle through official means. These owner restrictions came to high profile in 2014, when the musician Deadmau5 was sent a cease and desist letter regarding his highly customised 458 Italia: the car, which he dubbed the \"Purrari\", possessed custom badges and a Nyan Cat-themed wrap, and was put up for sale on Craigslist.\nFerrari does encourage its buyers to personalise their cars, but only through official channels, which include its Tailor Made programme for bespoke trim packages and special coachbuilding initiatives for more demanding commissions. The customisation options offered through these channels are extensive, though they are always in line with Ferrari's desired branding\u2014for example, the company offers no pink paint for its cars. In 2017, the CEO of the company's Australasia branch commented that this and similar customisations are \"against the company's ethos,\" and that such a stance is \"a brand rule. No pink. No \"Pok\u00e9mon\" Ferraris!\".\nCorporate affairs.\nIn 1963, Enzo Ferrari was approached by the Ford Motor Company about a possible buy out. Ford audited Ferrari's assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by Ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by Ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program. Henry Ford II consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with Lotus, Lola, and Cooper to build a car capable of beating Ferrari on the world endurance circuit, eventually resulting in the production of the Ford GT40 in 1964.\nAs the Ford deal fell through, FIAT approached Ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in 1969. Enzo Ferrari retained a 10% share, which is currently owned by his son Piero Lardi Ferrari.\nFerrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licences many products bearing the Ferrari brand, including eyewear, pens, pencils, electronic goods, perfume, cologne, clothing, high-tech bicycles, watches, cell phones, and laptop computers.\nFerrari also runs a museum, the Museo Ferrari in Maranello, which displays road and race cars and other items from the company's history.\nFormula Uomo programme.\nIn 1997, Ferrari launched a long term master planned effort to improve overall corporate efficiency, production and employee happiness. The program was called Formula Uomo and became a case study in social sustainability. It took over ten years to fully implement and included over \u20ac200 million (2008) in investment.\nTechnical partnerships.\nFerrari has had a long-standing relationship with petroleum company Shell Oil from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, and currently since 1996. Shell develops and supplies fuel and oils to the Scuderia Ferrari's Formula One and World Endurance Championship teams, as well as Ducati Corse's MotoGP and World Superbike teams. The Shell V-Power premium gasoline fuel is claimed to have been developed with the many years of technical expertise between Shell and Ferrari.\nFerrari has had agreements to supply Formula One engines to a number of other teams over the years, and currently supply the Sauber and Haas F1 F1 teams.\nSales history.\nAs of the end of 2019, the total of Ferrari built and sold cars in their whole company history is 219,062.\nIn October 2023, Ferrari started accepting payment in cryptocurrency for its vehicles in the US with intentions to expand the scheme to Europe in 2024. The cryptocurrency payments will be immediately traded into traditional currency to avoid price swings.\nRecalls.\nIn January 2020, the Italian carmaker said it will recall 982 vehicles for passenger airbags due to the Takata airbag recalls. If the inflator explodes, the airbag will spew metal shrapnel at passengers, which can cause severe injury. Every car involved will get a new passenger-side airbag assembly, complete with a new inflator without the dangerous propellant.\nOn 8 August 2022, the company recalled almost every car it's sold in the US since 2005 over a potential for brake failure. According to an NHTSA recall filing, 23,555 Ferrari models sold in America are fitted with a potentially faulty brake fluid reservoir cap that may not vent pressure adequately. The affected cars will be fitted with a replacement cap and receive a software update.\nStores and attractions.\nRoughly thirty Ferrari boutiques exist worldwide, with two owned by Ferrari and the rest operating as franchises. The stores sell branded clothes, accessories and racing memorabilia; some stores also feature racing simulators where visitors can drive virtual Ferrari vehicles. Clothing includes upscale and lower-priced collections for men, women, and children. Ferrari debuted their high fashion brand with their first runway in June 2021.\nThere are also two Ferrari-themed amusement parks:"}

{"id": "11227", "revid": "1652872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11227", "title": "Freemasonry", "text": "Freemasonry (sometimes spelled Free-Masonry) or simply Masonry includes various fraternal organisations that trace their origins to the local guilds of stonemasons that, from the end of the 14th century, regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. Freemasonry is the oldest fraternity in the world and among the oldest still continued organizations in history.\nModern Freemasonry broadly consists of three main traditions: Conservative Freemasonry (also called \"Regular Freemasonry\" by its adherents), which insists that a \"volume of sacred law\", such as the Bible, the Quran, or other religious scripture be open in a working lodge, that every member professes belief in a Supreme Being, that only men be admitted, and that discussion of religion or politics does not take place within the lodge; Liberal Freemasonry (sometimes called Continental Freemasonry), which has continued to evolve beyond these restrictions, particularly regarding religious belief and political discussion; and Women's and Mixed-Gender Freemasonry (Co-Freemasonry), which includes organizations that either admit women exclusively (such as the Order of Women Freemasons and The Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Masons in the UK) or accept both men and women (such as Le Droit Humain). All three traditions have evolved over time from their original forms\u2014Conservative Freemasonry has moved from requiring specifically Christian membership (except Catholics) with only the Bible on the altar to its current form, while Liberal Freemasonry continued evolving in different directions, particularly regarding religious requirements. Recent decades have seen further changes in Conservative Freemasonry, including shifting perspectives on shared jurisdictions and formal acknowledgment of women's Masonic organizations. Each of these traditions maintains its own philosophical approach to Masonic principles. The Liberal and Women's Masonic bodies are not officially recognized by Conservative Freemasonry but operate independently, often following the same Masonic rules, regulations, rituals and traditions (sometimes sharing buildings, such as Freemasons' Hall in London).\nThe basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level (usually coterminous with a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate. Lodges are found around the world and on all populated continents; however due to anti-Masonry and laws that effectively ban the tradition, it does not have a presence in every country. In the spirit of brotherhood and hopefulness, however, Freemasons usually presume that clandestine lodges may nonetheless exist in those countries in which it is banned, even if they may not actually exist.\nThe degrees of Freemasonry are the three grades of medieval craft guilds: Entered Apprentice, Journeyman or Fellow of the craft (now called either \"Fellowcraft\" or \"Fellow Craft\" in English speaking jurisdictions, and \"Companion\" in non-English speaking jurisdictions), and Master Mason. The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry and entrusted with grips, signs, and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated. The degrees are part allegorical morality play and part lecture. These three degrees form Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry, and members of any of these degrees are known as Free-Masons, Freemasons or Masons. Once the Craft degrees have been conferred upon a Mason, he is qualified to join various \"Concordant bodies\" which offer additional degrees. These organisations are usually administered separately from the Grand Lodges who administer the Craft degrees. The extra degrees vary with locality and jurisdiction. In addition to these bodies, there are further organizations outside of the more traditional Rites of Freemasonry, that require an individual to be a Master Mason before they can join (such as the Rosicrucian Society of England).\nThroughout its history, Freemasonry has received criticism and opposition on religious and political grounds. The Catholic Church, some Protestant denominations, and certain Islamic countries or entities have expressed opposition to or banned membership in Free-Masonry. Opposition to Freemasonry is sometimes rooted in anti-Semitism or conspiracy theories, and Freemasons have historically been persecuted by authoritarian states.\nMasonic lodge.\nThe Masonic lodge is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry. \nLodge Activities and Meetings.\nThe Masonic Lodge meets regularly to conduct various activities. While practices vary by jurisdiction, Rite, and local tradition, there are common elements across Freemasonry.\nIn many jurisdictions, Lodges conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation during regular meetings. This includes approving minutes, electing new members, appointing officers and taking their reports, considering correspondence, reviewing bills and annual accounts, and organising social and charitable events.\nHowever, some Lodges, Rites, and jurisdictions consider an opened Lodge to be a sacred space where profane business activities are strictly forbidden. In these traditions, administrative matters are typically conducted either before the Lodge is formally opened, in a separate business meeting, or handled by special committees outside of Lodge meetings.\nWhether business is conducted during an opened Lodge or not, all Masonic meetings include ritual work and also educational activities such as:\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Lodge may hold a formal dinner, called \"Agape\" or \"festive board\", sometimes involving toasting and song. These meetings are typically held in a Masonic temple, though other venues may occasionally be used.\nThe bulk of Masonic ritual consists of degree ceremonies. Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively \"initiated\" into Freemasonry, first in the degree of Entered Apprentice. At some later time, in separate ceremonies, they will be \"passed\" to the degree of Fellow Craft; and then \"raised\" to the degree of Master Mason. In each of these ceremonies, the candidate must first take the new obligations of the degree, and is then entrusted with secret knowledge including passwords, signs and grips (secret handshakes) confined to his new rank. Although these symbols and gestures are nominally secret, they are readily found in public sources, including those published by Masonic organisations themselves.\nAnother ceremony is the annual installation of the Master of the Lodge and his appointed or elected officers. In some jurisdictions, an \"Installed Master\" elected, obligated, and invested to preside over a Lodge, is valued as a separate rank with its own secrets and distinctive title and attributes; after each full year in the chair the Master invests his elected successor and becomes a Past Master with privileges in the Lodge and Grand Orient. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.\nMost Lodges have some sort of social functions, allowing members, their partners, and non-Masonic guests to meet openly. Often coupled with these events is the discharge of every Mason's and Lodge's collective obligation to contribute to charity. This occurs at many levels, including in annual dues, subscriptions, and fundraising events; and may be organized at the local Lodge level, a regional/district level or at the Grand jurisdiction level. Masons and their charities contribute for the relief of need in many fields, such as education, health and old age.\nPrivate Lodges form the backbone of Freemasonry, with the sole right to elect their own candidates for initiation as Masons or admission as joining Masons, and sometimes with exclusive rights over residents local to their premises. There are non-local Lodges where Masons meet for wider or narrower purposes, such as in association with some hobby, sport, Masonic research, business, profession, regiment or college. The rank of Master Mason also entitles a Freemason to explore Masonry further through other degrees, administered separately from the basic Craft or \"Blue Lodge\" degrees described here, but generally having a similar structure and meetings.\nThere is much diversity and little consistency in Freemasonry because each Masonic jurisdiction is independent and sets its own rules and procedures while Grand Lodges have limited jurisdiction over their constituent member Lodges, which are ultimately private clubs. The wording of the ritual, the number of officers present, the layout of the meeting room, etc. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nAlmost all officers of a Lodge are elected or appointed annually. Every Masonic Lodge has a Master, two Wardens, a treasurer and a secretary. There is also always a Tyler, or outer guard, outside the door of a working Lodge, who may be paid to secure its privacy. Other offices vary between jurisdictions.\nEach Masonic Lodge exists and operates according to its own by-laws and the rules and regulations of its own Grand Orient or Grand Lodge, which elude any universally accepted definition and vary depending on the Jurisdiction.\nJoining a lodge.\nThe process of joining a Masonic lodge follows similar general patterns worldwide while preserving regional and local variations between individual Lodges, Jurisdictions, Conservative and Liberal traditions. Historically, candidates \"were not to be admitted but by unanimous consent,\" a principle that continues in many lodges today, while some other jurisdictions have developed different systems to counter a potential problematic situation with a single black ball system. Additionally, some Lodges use black cubes instead of black balls to avoid confusion.\nInitial approach.\nIn the early days of Freemasonry, one had to be approached and \"co-opted\" to the Fraternity by an existing member but had to do it of his \"own free-will and accord\". This tradition continues in many jurisdictions mainly in Europe, Africa and South America. However, many obediences have adapted their approach methods, now allowing those without prior Masonic connections to express interest through online forms or during public events such as Masonic exhibitions and open conferences.\nA consistent rule throughout most Jurisdictions worldwide is that Freemasonry is not allowed to blindly recruit members. The prospective candidate must be qualified and either contacted by a member or reach out on his own. \nIn some Lodges the candidate is allowed to meet the members of the lodge they wish to join before being proposed for initiation; this allows all of the members to meet and get an idea of the candidate. While in other Lodges it is strictly prohibited for a non-mason (profane) to meet the members of the Lodge (besides the Master and proposer) before initiation in order to protect the identity of the members.\nAn old masonic term for the brother that proposes a candidate to a Lodge is that he becomes his 'Godfather' after invitation. This term is found in one of the earliest Masonic exposures \"Reception of a Frey-Macon, 1737\": \nSponsorship and investigation.\nOnce initial contact is established, the candidate is typically introduced to the lodge through sponsorship, typically by finding two members to sign the petition, the top-line signer becoming the godfather. The sponsor assumes significant responsibility toward the lodge by presenting a non-Mason, evaluating the alignment between the candidate's aspirations and Masonic values. This preliminary phase can last from a few months to several years depending on the Lodge and jurisdiction and generally includes several informal meetings to establish mutual trust and clarify expectations.\nFollowing this introduction, an investigation is generally started. Candidates can be invited to a series of interviews with various lodge officers or designated members. These meetings, often three in number, examine the candidate's profile, motivations, and compatibility with the lodge's philosophical orientation. The interviews also allow the candidate to ask questions and develop a clearer understanding of the commitment they are considering.\nFormal application and balloting.\nIf both the candidate and the lodge wish to proceed after these preliminary steps, a formal application may be proposed and seconded or announced in open Lodge and a more or less formal interview usually follows. If the candidate wishes to proceed, references are taken up during a period of notice so that members may enquire into the candidate's suitability and discuss it.\nIn many Jurisdictions a structured investigation is conducted by three members who do not personally know the candidate. These investigators meet individually with the applicant in different contexts with predetermined questions (or field of questions), examining their moral qualities, philosophical views, and ability to integrate into collective work or their Past, Present/future and Motivations. Each investigator then reports back to the lodge with their impressions, often expressing a favourable or unfavourable opinion. These preliminary interviews help both the lodge members and the candidate better understand each other before proceeding to the next stage.\nFollowing these investigations, some individual Lodges, Rites or Jurisdictions can or must implement a significant procedural step known as passing under the blindfold or sometimes the Low Door. This is not part of the initiation ceremony itself but rather a formal presentation of the candidate to the assembled lodge prior to any vote on admission. The candidate, blindfolded, is introduced to the lodge and must answer questions posed by the members. While previous investigators have reported the candidate's views, this direct questioning allows members to hear directly from the candidate and clarifies any uncertainties that may have arisen during the investigation process. Being blindfolded serves two purposes: it maintains the candidate's inability to identify lodge members if not admitted, and it allows the candidate to focus on the questions without being distracted by unfamiliar surroundings. It is only after this procedure that the lodge votes on the candidate's admission.\nFinally, the Lodge takes an officially secret ballot on each application before a candidate is either initiated or rejected. This ballot, traditionally using white balls (favourable) and black balls (unfavourable), gave rise to the expression \"blackballed\" to describe rejection. The exact number of adverse ballots (\"blackballs\") required to reject a candidate varies between Masonic jurisdictions.\nEligibility requirements.\nMasonic jurisdictions maintain various eligibility requirements, which differ significantly between Conservative and Liberal traditions:\nIn Conservative Freemasonry, exemplified by the United Grand Lodge of England and its recognised jurisdictions, candidates must typically:\nThe question of freedom, a standard feudal requirement of mediaeval guilds, is nowadays one of independence: the object is that every Mason should be a proper and responsible person. Thus, each Grand Lodge has a standard minimum age, varying greatly and often subject to dispensation in particular cases.\nAdditionally, most conservative Grand Lodges require a candidate to declare a belief in a Supreme Being (although every candidate must interpret this condition in his own way, as all religious discussion is commonly prohibited). \nIn a few cases, the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion. The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia (known as the Swedish Rite), and the Rectified Scottish Rite for example, only accepts Christians.\nIn Liberal Freemasonry, exemplified by the Grand Orient de France, requirements have evolved to emphasize freedom of conscience, they include:\nSome obediences have removed the requirement for belief in a Supreme Being, accepting atheists and agnostics. Many Liberal bodies now accept women, either in mixed-gender lodges or women-only lodges. The emphasis is placed on moral character, philosophical inquiry, and commitment to human progress.\nThe diverse approaches to these fundamental requirements reflect the philosophical evolution within Freemasonry over time, with Conservative bodies maintaining traditional rules (although still evolving) while Liberal traditions have adapted to changing social contexts.\nAfter successful passage through the investigation process and favourable vote, the initiation ceremony marks the candidate's official entry into Freemasonry.\nProgression through degrees.\nThe time between degrees varies considerably across jurisdictions and individual Lodges. Depending on the specific lodge and jurisdictions, progression can be relatively quick\u2014sometimes within a year to multiple years, while it is difficult to establish an average due to the wide ranges of style. Many Grand Lodges or Grand Orients have a minimum of one year in-between degrees. Being passed to the next degree depends on the requirements established by the individual Lodge and jurisdictions. These can include demonstrating proficiency through presentations of masonic research papers, active participation in the Lodge, memorisation of the ritual or other masonic documents, reading books or even concrete self-improvement.\nOrganisation.\nGrand Lodges.\nGrand Lodges (sometimes termed Grand Orients) are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state or geographical area (termed a \"jurisdiction\"). There is no single overarching governing body that presides over worldwide Freemasonry; connections between different jurisdictions depend solely on mutual recognition.\nEstimates of the worldwide membership of Freemasonry in the early 21st century ranged from about two million to more than six million.\nThe fraternity is administratively organised into independent Grand Lodges (or sometimes Grand Orients), each of which governs its own Masonic jurisdiction, which consists of subordinate (or \"constituent\") Lodges.\nThe United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) remains the largest Masonic jurisdiction worldwide. However, its membership has declined dramatically, from about 500,000 members in the 1960s to approximately 170,000 in 2023. The organisation is structured into various Provincial Grand Lodges at the local level. Similarly, the Grand Lodge of Ireland has experienced a steep decline, with membership falling from 100,000 in 1960 to around 19,000 members currently.\nIn the United States, Masonic membership is organised in two systems, first through 51 Conservative Grand Lodges\u2014one for each state plus the District of Columbia. While these Grand Lodges once boasted over 4 million members in 1957, membership has declined sharply. According to the Masonic Service Association of North America, current combined membership across these jurisdictions stands at approximately 875,000 members.\nAdditionally, there are 46 Prince Hall Grand Lodges in amity with UGLE, operating across various U.S. states. Prince Hall Freemasonry is a historically African-American branch of Freemasonry that maintains its own separate Grand Lodge system parallel to the state Grand Lodge system.\nTogether, these two systems\u2014the conservative Grand Lodges and Prince Hall Grand Lodges\u2014make up for a total of 97 UGLE recognised Grand Lodges, sharing jurisdictions in the United States. They represent the main bodies of Masonic governance in the United States, though both have experienced significant membership declines since their mid-20th century peaks.\nIn France, the Grand Orient de France stands as the largest and most influential body in Liberal Freemasonry, with over 53,000 members across approximately 1,381 lodges. Unlike many Conservative jurisdictions that have experienced significant membership declines, the Grand Orient has demonstrated remarkable growth, increasing from 33,000 members in 1960 to 53,000 in 2023. This growth reflects the enduring appeal of its Liberal philosophical approach, which emphasizes freedom of conscience, social progress, and intellectual inquiry. The Grand Orient has been particularly influential in French political and intellectual life, championing principles of secularism, democracy, and human rights throughout its history.\nRecognition, amity and regularity.\nRelations between Grand Lodges are determined by the concept of \"Recognition\". Each Grand Lodge or Grand Orient maintains a list of other Grand Orients or Grand Lodges that it recognises. When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be \"in amity\", and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are \"Exclusive Jurisdiction\" and \"Regularity\".\nExclusive jurisdiction.\nExclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby normally only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in amity and agree to share jurisdiction. For example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both. Likewise, the five distinct kinds of lodges in Germany have nominally united under one Grand Lodge in order to obtain international recognition.\nModern challenges and evolution.\nThe concept of Exclusive Jurisdiction has been significantly challenged in the United States with the increasing recognition of Prince Hall Grand Lodges, a branch of Freemasonry created for African Americans. Historically, many \"mainstream\" or conservative U.S. Grand Lodges refused to recognize Prince Hall Grand Lodges operating in their states, citing Exclusive Jurisdiction. However, this began to change in 1989 when the Grand Lodge of Connecticut extended recognition to its Prince Hall counterpart.\nThis initial recognition created a precedent for \"shared jurisdiction\" between mainstream and Prince Hall Grand Lodges, effectively modifying the traditional interpretation of Exclusive Jurisdiction. By 2024, most U.S. Grand Lodges have recognized their Prince Hall counterparts, establishing a new norm where two Grand Lodges can legitimately operate within the same geographical area, provided they maintain mutual recognition and amity.\nThe evolution of this practice demonstrates how traditional Masonic principles can adapt to accommodate social progress while maintaining the fundamental aims of regular Freemasonry. Some jurisdictions have formalized this arrangement through written agreements that specifically outline the terms of shared jurisdiction.\nOrigins of the concept.\nThe concept of \"regularity\" originated before the divide between Conservative and Liberal Freemasonry existed, first appearing in Payne's regulations as printed in Anderson's \"Constitutions\". In regulation VIII we find:\nThis early recognition system was used to determine if a Lodge was trustworthy and not fraudulent, rather than to enforce doctrinal conformity.\nLiberal and Conservative Recognition Systems.\nBoth Liberal and Conservative traditions have developed their own interpretations of regularity, each evolving over time despite differing philosophical foundations. The modern understanding of these concepts crystallised after the 1877 constitutional reforms of the Grand Orient de France (GOdF), which embraced absolute freedom of conscience and removed mandatory belief in a Supreme Being.\nConservative Landmarks and Their Evolution.\nConservative Freemasonry, exemplified by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), bases its concept of regularity on adherence to \"landmarks\"\u2014fundamental principles considered essential to Masonic identity. While often presented as immutable, these landmarks have undergone significant reinterpretation over time.\nThe religious requirement, initially revolutionary in the early 1700s for being strictly for Christians but welcoming all denominations during an era of sectarian strife, has gradually expanded. It evolved first to include all religions with a revealed scripture and the resurrection of the body after life, then to accept belief in any Supreme Being, and increasingly allows more personalised interpretations of spirituality whilst maintaining the requirement for some form of metaphysical belief.\nSimilarly, the principle of exclusive territorial jurisdiction has evolved in the United States, where many states now share jurisdiction between Prince Hall and mainstream Grand Lodges\u2014a significant departure from historical practice.\nPerhaps most telling is the evolution regarding women in Freemasonry. The UGLE, whilst maintaining gender separation within its own Lodges, formally acknowledged in 1999 that \"Freemasonry is not confined to men\" and recognised the legitimacy of women's Masonic orders, though without permitting intervisitation. The UGLE now engages in collaborative charitable projects with women's Masonic organisations, representing a significant evolution from earlier positions that denied women could be legitimate Freemasons at all.\nIt's important to understand that no universal landmarks exist within Freemasonry. Each Grand Lodge or Grand Orient maintains its own set of Landmarks, with some conservative bodies not codifying any specific landmarks whatsoever. The practical reality of Masonic recognition hinges not on universal agreement about landmarks, but rather on ensuring that no recognised body violates the landmark principles held dear by the recognising jurisdiction.\nWithin Conservative Freemasonry, the shared rules for Recognition vary considerably, shaped by the particular Masonic tradition each Grand Lodge embraces. Three landmark systems have gained particular prominence within Masonic jurisprudence: the 1929 United Grand Lodge of England landmarks, which focus on governance and practical recognition requirements; Albert Mackey's extensive 1858 catalogue of twenty-five landmarks, which comprehensively delineates administrative structures and principles; and Roscoe Pound's streamlined 1911 approach, which distils Masonic landmarks to seven essential philosophical elements.\nAs can be seen from this comparison, while there are common elements across all three landmark systems (belief in Deity, male-only membership, symbolic/speculative nature), there are significant differences in scope, detail, and emphasis. The UGLE system focuses primarily on governance and recognition requirements, Mackey's extensive list includes detailed administrative prerogatives, while Pound's streamlined approach emphasizes the philosophical essentials.\nLiberal Landmarks and Philosophical Foundations.\nLiberal Freemasonry approaches regularity through a fundamentally different lens, tracing its philosophical foundations to earlier Masonic documents such as the Constitution of the Freemasons of Strasbourg in 1459, which predates Anderson's Constitutions by over 250 years. Rather than viewing landmarks as fixed and immutable, Liberal Masonry sees them as principles open to democratic debate and evolutionary interpretation.\nThe Grand Orient de France (GOdF), established in 1723 renamed in 1773, serves as the gold standard in Liberal Masonic recognition. Recognition by the GOdF represents a significant achievement for any Grand Orient or Grand Lodge within the Liberal Masonic community, affirming their commitment to the principles of freedom of conscience and universal brotherhood. The GOdF maintains recognition agreements with numerous Masonic bodies worldwide based on shared philosophical principles rather than adherence to particular core principles or landmarks.\nBy contrast, Liberal Masonic bodies typically employ recognition criteria centred on:\nThese principles reflect the Enlightenment values that informed early Freemasonry, emphasising human reason, freethought, progressive social engagement, and intellectual liberty.\nFurthermore, the Grand Orient de France famously describes what Freemasonry is in the first article of its constitution, deviation from these principles could lead a Grand Lodge to become un-recognised by the GOdF : \nInternational Recognition Networks.\nBoth traditions have established complex international networks to facilitate recognition and cooperation.\nMany Liberal Grand Lodges participate in CLIPSAS, which promotes a more inclusive approach to inter-Masonic relations than the exclusivity often practised by Conservative bodies. Founded in 1961 by eleven sovereign Masonic bodies, CLIPSAS has grown to include over 100 member obediences worldwide. Though CLIPSAS's influence was challenged by the GOdF's withdrawal in 2019, it remains significant in facilitating Liberal Masonic relations globally. Other important Liberal Masonic international organisations include TRACIA (coordinating Liberal bodies across Europe and Latin America) and UMM (uniting Mediterranean Masonic bodies).\nConservative Freemasonry operates primarily through bilateral recognition between Grand Lodges, with the UGLE, Grand Lodge of Scotland, and Grand Lodge of Ireland (collectively known as the \"Home Grand Lodges\") having particular influence within this system. The Conference of Grand Masters of North America provides another forum for Conservative Masonic cooperation, though without the formal recognition powers of CLIPSAS in the Liberal tradition.\nOther degrees, orders, and bodies.\nBlue Lodges, known as Craft Lodges in the United Kingdom, offer only the three traditional degrees. In most jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master is also conferred in Blue/Craft Lodges. Master Masons are able to extend their Masonic experience by taking further degrees, in concordant or other bodies whether or not approved by their own Grand Lodge.\nThe Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite is a system of 33 degrees, including the three Blue Lodge degrees administered by a local or national Supreme Council. This system is popular in North America, South America and in Continental Europe. In America, the York Rite, with a similar range, administers three orders of Masonry, namely the Royal Arch, Cryptic Masonry, and Knights Templar.\nIn Britain, separate bodies administer each order. Freemasons are encouraged to join the Holy Royal Arch, which is linked to Mark Masonry in Scotland and Ireland, but completely separate in England. In England, the Royal Arch is closely associated with the Craft, automatically having many Grand Officers in common, including H.R.H the Duke of Kent as both Grand Master of the Craft and First Grand Principal of the Royal Arch. The English Knights Templar and Cryptic Masonry share the Mark Grand Lodge offices and staff at Mark Masons Hall. The Ancient and Accepted Rite (similar to the Scottish Rite), requires a member to proclaim the Trinitarian Christian faith, and is administered from Duke Street in London. Conversely, the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia is a fully independent esoteric organization that requires members be United Grand Lodge of England Master Masons.\nIn the Nordic countries, the Swedish Rite is dominant; a variation of it is also used in parts of Germany.\nRitual and symbolism.\nFreemasonry describes itself as a \"beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols\". The symbolism is mainly, but not exclusively, drawn from the tools of stonemasons\u2014the square and compasses, the level and plumb rule, the trowel, the rough and smooth ashlars, among others. Moral lessons are attributed to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent. The meaning of the symbolism is taught and explored through ritual, and in lectures and articles by individual Masons who offer their personal insights and opinions.\nAccording to the scholar of Western esotericism Jan A. M. Snoek: \"the best way to characterize Freemasonry is in terms of what it is not, rather than what it is\". All Freemasons begin their journey in the \"craft\" by being progressively \"initiated\", \"passed\" and \"raised\" into the three degrees of Craft, or Blue Lodge Masonry. During these three rituals, the candidate is progressively taught the Masonic symbols, and entrusted with grips or tokens, signs, and words to signify to other Masons which degrees he has taken. The dramatic allegorical ceremonies include explanatory lectures and revolve around the construction of the Temple of Solomon, and the artistry and death of the chief architect, Hiram Abiff. The degrees are those of \"Entered apprentice\", \"Fellowcraft\" and \"Master Mason\". While many different versions of these rituals exist, with various lodge layouts and versions of the Hiramic legend, each version is recognizable to any Freemason from any jurisdiction.\nIn some jurisdictions, the main themes of each degree are illustrated by tracing boards. These painted depictions of Masonic themes are exhibited in the lodge according to which degree is being worked and are explained to the candidate to illustrate the legend and symbolism of each degree.\nThe idea of Masonic brotherhood probably descends from a 16th-century legal definition of a \"brother\" as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to support and protect their brethren. In most Lodges, the oath or obligation is taken on a \"Volume of Sacred Law\", whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In \"Progressive\" continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nSince the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 to the beginning of the 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate it to a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining. The 15th century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia.\nThere is no clear mechanism by which these local trade organisations became today's Masonic Lodges. The earliest rituals and passwords known, from operative lodges around the turn of the 17th\u201318th centuries, show continuity with the rituals developed in the later 18th century by accepted or speculative Masons, as those members who did not practice the physical craft gradually came to be known. The minutes of the Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No. 1 in Scotland show a continuity from an operative lodge in 1598 to a modern speculative Lodge. It is reputed to be the oldest Masonic Lodge in the world.\nAlternatively, Thomas De Quincey in his work titled \"Rosicrucians and Freemasonry\" put forward the theory that suggested that Freemasonry may have been an outgrowth of Rosicrucianism. The theory had also been postulated in 1803 by German professor; J. G. Buhle.\nThe first Grand Lodge, the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster, later called the Grand Lodge of England, was founded on St John's Day, 24 June 1717, when four existing London Lodges met for a joint dinner. Over the next decade, most of the existing Lodges in England joined the new regulatory body, which itself entered a period of self-publicity and expansion. New lodges were created, and the fraternity began to grow.\nDuring the course of the 18th century, as aristocrats and artists crowded out the craftsmen originally associated with the organization, Freemasonry became fashionable throughout Europe and the American colonies.\nBetween 1730 and 1750, the Grand Lodge endorsed several significant changes that some Lodges could not endorse. A rival Grand Lodge was formed on 17 July 1751, which called itself the \"Antient Grand Lodge of England\" to signify that, in their opinion, these lodges were maintaining older traditions and rejected changes that the Premiere Grand Lodge had adopted. As an insult, the self proclaimed \"Antient Grand Lodge\" coined the term \"modern\" to designate the Premiere Grand Lodge (historians now use Premiere Grand Lodge and Antient Grand Lodge \u2013 to differentiate the two bodies). These two Grand Lodges vied for supremacy until the Premiere Grand Lodge made a compromise with the antient Grand Lodge to return to a ritual that worked for both Grand Lodges. They re-united on 27 December 1813 to form the United Grand Lodge of England.\nThe Grand Lodge of Ireland and the Grand Lodge of Scotland were formed in 1725 and 1736, respectively, although neither persuaded all of the existing lodges in their countries to join for many years.\nNorth America.\nThe earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The collector for the port of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, two years before the putative formation of the first Grand Lodge in London. The Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania, leading to the creation of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.\nIn Canada, Erasmus James Philipps became a Freemason while working on a commission to resolve boundaries in New England and, in 1739, he became provincial Grand Master for Nova Scotia; Philipps founded the first Masonic lodge in Canada at Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia.\nOther lodges in the colony of Pennsylvania obtained authorisations from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge, applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival.\nAfter the American Revolution, independent U.S. Grand Lodges developed within each state. Some thought was briefly given to organising an overarching \"Grand Lodge of the United States\", with George Washington, who was a member of a Virginian lodge, as the first Grand Master, but the idea was short-lived. The various state Grand Lodges did not wish to diminish their own authority by agreeing to such a body.\nOn April 30, 1789, George Washington took his oath of office at his first inauguration upon a bible belonging to St. John's Lodge No. 1 of New York. Originally, it was expected that Washington would bring his own Bible upon which to swear his oath of office, and there was some consternation when it turned out that no one had informed Washington to bring one. Thinking quickly, Jacob Morton, the Marshal of the Inauguration (and Master of St. John's Lodge), borrowed the Lodge's Bible for use in the ceremony. That bible has been known since as the George Washington Inaugural Bible, and is still in possession of St. John's Lodge No. 1 of the Grand Lodge of New York. Robert Livingston, Chancellor of the State of New York, also the first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York, administered the oath. This event effectuated the establishment of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government of the United States, which had until then existed only virtually after the US Constitution become operational almost two months earlier, on March 4, 1789.\nJamaican Freemasonry.\nFreemasonry was imported to Jamaica by British immigrants who colonized the island for over 300 years. In 1908, there were eleven recorded Masonic lodges, which included three Grand Lodges, two Craft lodges, and two Rose Croix chapters. During slavery, the lodges were open to all \"freeborn\" men. According to the Jamaican 1834 census, that potentially included 5,000 free black men and 40,000 free people of colour (mixed race). After the full abolition of slavery in 1838, the Lodges were open to all Jamaican men of any race. Jamaica also kept close relationships with Masons from other countries. Jamaican Freemasonry historian Jackie Ranston, noted that:\nOn 25 May 2017, Masons around the world celebrated the 300th anniversary of the fraternity. Jamaica hosted one of the regional gatherings for this celebration.\nPrince Hall Freemasonry.\nPrince Hall Freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit African Americans. In 1775, an African American named Prince Hall, along with 14 other African American men, was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in Boston. When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Grand Lodge of England (Premiere Grand Lodge) and formed African Lodge, Number 459. When the two English grand lodges united in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls\u2014largely because of the War of 1812. Thus, separated from both English jurisdiction and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge retitled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1\u2014and became a \"de facto\" Grand Lodge. (This lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges in Africa.) As with the rest of U.S. Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organised on a Grand Lodge system for each state.\nUnlike other fraternal orders, there was never any blanket rule against the admission of men based on their race. Each lodge and grand lodge had their own rules, both written and unwritten. A few non-Prince Hall lodges did admit Blacks, with Angelo Soliman being one notable Masonic personality of African descent. Nonetheless, widespread racial segregation in 19th- and early 20th-century North America made it difficult for African Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions.\nToday most (but not all) U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of African Americans, Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion.\nEmergence of Continental or Liberal Freemasonry.\nEnglish Freemasonry spread to France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, and then as distinctively French lodges that still follow the ritual of the Premier Grand Lodge of England. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France was formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority. His successor, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the French Revolution, French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century, at first under the leadership of Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse, Comte de Grassy-Tilly.\nFreemasonry in the Middle East.\nAfter the failure of the 1830 Italian revolution, a number of Italian Freemasons were forced to flee. They secretly set up an approved chapter of Scottish Rite in Alexandria, a town already inhabited by a large Italian community. Meanwhile, the French Freemasons publicly organised a local chapter in Alexandria in 1845. During the 19th and 20th century Ottoman Empire, Masonic lodges operated widely across all parts of the empire and numerous Sufi orders shared a close relationship with them. Many Young Turks affiliated with the Bektashi order were members and patrons of Freemasonry. They were also closely allied against European imperialism. Many Ottoman intellectuals believed that Sufism and Freemasonry shared close similarities in doctrines, spiritual outlook and mysticism.\nSchism.\nRacial schism.\nThe relationship between English and French Freemasonry changed significantly during the formation of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1813. While the two jurisdictions maintained mutual recognition for several decades, events in the 1860s and 1870s led to a lasting division. In 1868, the \"Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana\" established itself within the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana. This body, recognised by the Grand Orient de France but was considered irregular by the Grand Lodge of Louisiana because it admitted Black members. The following year, shocked by the Grand Lodge of Louisiana's discrimination practices, the Grand Orient de France clarified and cemented its positions by passing a resolution declaring that \"neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry\". This prompted the Grand Lodge of Louisiana to withdraw recognition and influenced other American Grand Lodges to do the same.\nTheological schism.\nA philosophical debate during the Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875 led the Grand Orient de France to examine its foundational principles. Following a report by a Protestant pastor, they concluded that Freemasonry, not being a religion, should not require religious belief. The Grand Orient revised its constitution to emphasise \"absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity\", removing previous requirements regarding belief in the existence of God and the immortality of the soul. The United Grand Lodge of England subsequently withdrew recognition of the Grand Orient de France, possibly influenced by contemporary political tensions between France and Britain. This separation continues today.\nEvolution of styles.\nThis philosophical development led to a diversification within French Freemasonry. In 1894, some lodges formed the Grande Loge de France, maintaining reference to the Great Architect of the Universe while preserving many French Masonic traditions, representing a middle path between Liberal and Conservative approaches. By 1913, the United Grand Lodge of England established relations with the newly formed \"Grande Loge Nationale Ind\u00e9pendante et R\u00e9guli\u00e8re pour la France et les Colonies Fran\u00e7aises,\" which aligned more closely with Conservative Masonic practices.\nThis diversification allowed French Freemasonry to develop along multiple legitimate paths. The Grand Orient de France continued as a significant intellectual and progressive force in French society. Its Liberal emphasis on freedom of conscience and social progress has been particularly influential in the development of secular democratic values throughout Europe and beyond, while Conservative bodies maintained their own distinct approach to Masonic principles.\nModern Freemasonry encompasses three main approaches, which influence practice throughout Continental Europe:\nThe term Continental Freemasonry historically described the diverse Masonic traditions that developed in Europe. While Albert Mackey's 1873 \"Encyclopedia of Freemasonry\" defined it from a Conservative perspective as lodges that \"retain many usages which have either been abandoned by, or never were observed in, the Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland,\" a more balanced view recognizes that these represent distinct philosophical approaches to Masonic principles.\nToday, Liberal Freemasonry encompasses traditions like the Grand Orient de France, which emphasizes freedom of conscience and social progress, as well as bodies like the Grande Loge de France that maintain some traditional elements while embracing certain Liberal principles. These organizations have played significant roles in the development of democratic ideals, human rights, and social reform throughout Europe and Latin America, representing a dynamic interpretation of Masonic principles focused on human advancement and the betterment of society.\nDifferent approaches to recognition and interaction between Masonic bodies emerged in the 20th century. In 1961, several Grand Lodges and Grand Orients established the Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances ma\u00e7onniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg (CLIPSAS), creating an international forum for Masonic cooperation. CLIPSAS membership includes over 100 Masonic organisations worldwide, encompassing traditional, liberal, and mixed-gender organisations.\nThis development reflected different philosophical approaches to Masonic recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England maintains a policy of exclusive recognition based on specific criteria, including belief in a Supreme Being and male-only membership. In contrast, CLIPSAS member organisations generally practise open recognition, allowing interaction between diverse Masonic traditions.\nThese differing approaches to recognition have led to distinct networks of Masonic interaction, often characterised as Conservative or Anglo-American and Liberal or Continental traditions, though this simplification does not fully capture the complexity of modern Masonic relationships.\nHowever, recent developments indicate shifting perspectives within Conservative Freemasonry regarding women's organisations. In 1999, the United Grand Lodge of England officially acknowledged both The Order of Women Freemasons and the Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons (Freemasonry for Women) as legitimate Masonic bodies. While not extending formal recognition, UGLE maintains \"excellent working relationships\" with both Grand Lodges and collaborates with them on various initiatives, including joint participation in Open House London events at Freemasons' Hall and university recruitment fairs. This represents a significant evolution from earlier stricter positions and demonstrates increasing liberalisation and acceptance of diverse Masonic traditions.\nAdditionally, in 2018, UGLE released guidance explicitly welcoming transgender members and affirming that \"A Freemason who after initiation ceases to be a man does not cease to be a Freemason.\"\nFreemasonry and women.\nThe status of women in the old guilds and corporations of medieval masons remains uncertain. The principle of \"femme sole\" allowed a widow to continue the trade of her husband, but its application had wide local variations, such as full membership of a trade body or limited trade by deputation or approved members of that body. In masonry, the small available evidence points to the less empowered end of the scale.\nAt the dawn of the Grand Lodge era, during the 1720s, James Anderson composed the first printed constitutions for Freemasons, the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry. As Freemasonry spread, women began to be added to the Lodges of Adoption by their husbands who were continental masons, which worked three degrees with the same names as the men's but different content. The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century. Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry.\nMaria Deraismes was initiated into Freemasonry in 1882, then resigned to allow her lodge to rejoin their Grand Lodge. Having failed to achieve acceptance from any masonic governing body, she and Georges Martin started a mixed masonic lodge that worked masonic ritual. Annie Besant spread the phenomenon to the English-speaking world. Disagreements over ritual led to the formation of exclusively female bodies of Freemasons in England, which spread to other countries. Meanwhile, the French had re-invented Adoption as an all-female lodge in 1901, only to cast it aside again in 1935. The lodges, however, continued to meet, which gave rise, in 1959, to a body of women practising continental Freemasonry.\nIn general, Continental Freemasonry is sympathetic to Freemasonry among women, dating from the 1890s when French lodges assisted the emergent co-masonic movement by promoting enough of their members to the 33rd degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite to allow them, in 1899, to form their own grand council, recognised by the other Continental Grand Councils of that Rite. The United Grand Lodge of England issued a statement in 1999 recognising the two women's grand lodges there, The Order of Women Freemasons and The Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons, to be regular in all but the participants. While they were not, therefore, recognised as regular, they were part of Freemasonry \"in general\". The attitude of most regular Anglo-American grand lodges remains that women Freemasons are not legitimate Masons.\nIn 2018, guidance was released by the United Grand Lodge of England stating that, in regard to transgender women, \"A Freemason who after initiation ceases to be a man does not cease to be a Freemason\". The guidance also states that transgender men are allowed to apply.\nDevelopment and expansion.\n18th-century Enlightenment.\nDuring the Age of the Enlightenment in the 18th century, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges. They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places. British Freemasonry offered a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals. It fostered new codes of conduct\u2014including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability\u2014\"liberty, fraternity, and equality\" Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism. Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France\u2014by 1789, there were between 50,000 and 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations.\nJacob argues that Masonic lodges probably had an effect on society as a whole, for they \"reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives\". In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the Continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid-1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles. Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe made reference to the Enlightenment in general in the 18th century. In French lodges, for example, the line \"As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened\" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to \"initiate the unenlightened\". Many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe.\nOn the other hand, historian Robert Roswell Palmer noted that lodges operated separately and Masons politically did not act together as a group. American historians note that Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were leading Masons, but the significance of freemasonry in the revolution is a topic of debate. Daniel Roche contests freemasonry's claims for egalitarianism, writing that \"the real equality of the lodges was elitist\", only attracting men of similar social backgrounds.\nIn long-term historical perspective, Norman Davies has argued that Freemasonry was a powerful force in Europe, from about 1700 to the twentieth century. It expanded rapidly during the Age of Enlightenment, reaching practically every country in Europe, as well as the European colonies in the New World and Asia. Davies states, \"In the nineteenth century and beyond it would be strongly associated with the cause of Liberalism.\" In Catholic lands it was anti-clerical and came under heavy attack from the Catholic Church. In the 20th century, it was suppressed by Fascist and Communist regimes. It was especially attractive to royalty, aristocrats and politicians and businessmen, as well as intellectuals, artists and political activists. Davies notes that prominent members included Montesquieu, Voltaire, Sir Robert Walpole, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington. Steven Bullock notes that in the late 18th century, English lodges were headed by the Prince of Wales, Prussian lodges by king Frederick the Great, and French lodges by royal princes. Emperor Napoleon selected his own brother as the Grand Master of France.\nFrance.\nIn the 18th century, liberal French politicians met together in Masonic lodges to develop some of the Enlightenment ideas that dominated the French Revolution of 1789. Avner Halpern has traced French Freemasonry's major role in building France's first modern political party in 1901, the Radical Party. It used two Masonic devices: the \"civil leadership model\", which Freemasonry developed in late 19th century France, and the local Masonic congresses of the Grand Orient of France federations.\nRussia.\nFreemasons had been active in Russia in the 18th century, working to introduce Enlightenment ideals; however, they were increasingly suppressed by the government. According to Ludwick Hass, Freemasonry was officially illegal in Tsarist Russia, but would later be introduced by exiles who returned after the 1905 revolution. These individuals had been active Masons in Paris, where lodges were politically active in the new Radical Party. In Russia, the Freemasons supported constitutional liberalism, and maintained ties with France while simplifying many of the ceremonial rituals. Their secret meetings became a centre of progressive ideals, attracting politicians and activists. The lodges initially supported World War I, promoting close ties with France. Alexander Kerensky was an important Masonic activist who came to political power with the overthrow of the tsars, in 1917. The organization collapsed as the Bolsheviks took power and was again outlawed.\nItaly.\nAccording to Adrian Lyttelton, in the early 20th century, Freemasonry was an influential but semi-secret force in Italian politics; with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, its appeal spread to the leadership of the parliament, public administration, and the army. The two main organisations were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had around 25,000 members in some 500 lodges. Freemasons typically espoused anticlericalism and promoted unification. The Catholic Church was a vigorous opponent of unification, and thus of the Freemasons; various national governments would repeatedly alternate and backpedal between the anticlerical side and the Church side. Politically, they promoted Italian nationalism focused on unification and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, encouraging public opinion and the leading political parties in support of Italy's joining of the Allies of the First World War in 1914\u20131915. In 1919, they favoured a League of Nations to promote a new post-war, universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations. In the early 1920s, many of Mussolini's collaborators, especially the leaders in organizing the March on Rome, were Masons. The lodges hailed fascism as the saviour of Italy from Bolshevism; however, Mussolini decided he needed to come to terms with the Catholic Church, in the mid-1920s, outlawing Freemasonry.\nLatin America.\nThe Spanish government outlawed Freemasonry in its overseas empire in the mid-18th century, and energetically enforced the ban. Nevertheless, many Freemasons were active in planning and plotting for independence. Leaders with Freemason membership included Grand Master Francisco de Miranda, Jos\u00e9 de San Martin, Sim\u00f3n Bolivar, Bernardo O'Higgins, and many others. The movement was important after independence was achieved in the 1820s. In Brazil, many prominent men were Freemasons, and they played a leading role in the abolition of slavery.\nMexico.\nFreemasons were leaders in liberalism and anti-clericalism in 19th and 20th-century Mexico. Members included numerous top leaders. The Freemasons were divided regarding relations with the United States, with a pro-U.S. faction supported by the American ambassador Joel Poinsett known as the \"Yorkinos\". According to historian Karen Racine, Freemasons in the presidency of Mexico included: Guadalupe Victoria, Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, Benito Ju\u00e1rez, Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada, Porfirio D\u00edaz, Francisco I. Madero, Venustiano Carranza, Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Emilio Portes Gil, Pascual Ortiz Rubio, Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez, and Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s.\nChina.\nThe first lodge formed in China was the Amity Lodge which constituted at Canton in 1767. In 1875, District Grand Lodge of China split into two Districts, Northern China, and Hong Kong and South China. During the second world war, All Masonic activity in Hong Kong was brought to a halt due to the Japanese invasion. After 1949, when the new Chinese government (Communist) was established, some lodges moved to Hong Kong or closed due to lack of new candidates. Freemasonry is currently outlawed by the Chinese Communist Party in mainland China. It is permitted in Hong Kong. \nFreemasonry survived on the island of Taiwan and the Grand Lodge of China is based in Taipei.\nHong Kong.\nRoyal Sussex Lodge No. 501 was the first lodge established in Victoria City of Hong Kong on 29 April 1844.\nFor the English Constitution, Provincial or District Grand Lodge name in Hong Kong Changed as following:\nFor the Scottish Constitution, District Grand Lodge name in Hong Kong Changed as following:\nFor the Irish Constitution, Provincial or District Grand Lodge name in Hong Kong Changed as following:\nNow, there are 19 (English Constitution) lodges under the District Grand Lodge of Hong Kong and Far East, United Grand Lodge of England and meet at Zetland Hall, Hong Kong:\nAnti-Masonry.\n\"Anti-Masonry\" (alternatively called \"Anti-Freemasonry\") has been defined as \"opposition to Freemasonry\", but there is no homogeneous anti-Masonic movement. Anti-Masonry consists of widely differing criticisms from diverse (and often incompatible) groups who are hostile to Freemasonry in some form. Critics have included religious groups, political groups, and conspiracy theorists, in particular, those espousing Masonic conspiracy theories or the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory. Certain prominent Anti-Masons, such as Nesta Helen Webster, exclusively criticized \"Continental Masonry\", while considering \"Regular Masonry\" to be an honourable association.\nThere have been many disclosures and expos\u00e9s dating as far back as the 18th century. These often lack context, may be outdated for various reasons, or could be outright hoaxes on the part of the author, as in the case of the Taxil hoax.\nThese hoaxes and expos\u00e9s have often become the basis for criticism of Masonry, often religious or political in nature or are based on suspicion of corrupt conspiracy of some form. The political opposition that arose after the American \"Morgan Affair\" in 1826 gave rise to the term \"Anti-Masonry\", which is still in use in America today, both by Masons in referring to their critics and as a self-descriptor by the critics themselves.\nReligious opposition.\nFreemasonry has attracted criticism from theocratic states and organised religions that believe it is in competition with religion or perceive the fraternity's views or practices as heterodox; it has also long been the target of conspiracy theories that assert Freemasonry to be an occult and evil power.\nChristianity and Freemasonry.\nAlthough members of various faiths cite objections, certain Christian denominations have had high-profile negative attitudes to Masonry, banning or discouraging their members from being Freemasons. The denomination with the longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the Catholic Church. The objections raised by the Catholic Church are based on the allegation that Masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion which is in conflict with Church doctrine. More than 600 Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry. The first was Pope Clement XII's \"In eminenti apostolatus,\" 28 April 1738; the most recent was Pope Francis in a letter by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith 13 November 2023.\nThe \"1917 Code of Canon Law\" explicitly declared that joining Freemasonry entailed automatic excommunication and banned books favouring Freemasonry.\nIn 1983, the Church issued a new code of canon law. Unlike its predecessor, the \"1983 Code of Canon Law\" did not explicitly name Masonic orders among the secret societies it condemns. It states: \"A person who joins an association which plots against the Church is to be punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an interdict.\" This named omission of Masonic orders caused both Catholics and Freemasons to believe that the ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons may have been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalisation of Vatican II. However, the matter was clarified when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a Declaration on Masonic Associations, which states: \"...\u00a0the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enroll in Masonic associations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion.\" In 2023, Pope Francis reaffirmed the ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons stating the \"[...] irreconcilability between Catholic doctrine and Freemasonry [...]\" in response to Julito Cortes, Bishop of Dumanguete, who stated concerns over the growing number of Freemasons in the Philippines. The renewed ban cited both the \"1983 Code of Canon Law\", as well as the \"Guidelines\" made by a Bishops Conference in 2003. For its part, Freemasonry has never objected to Catholics joining their fraternity. Those Grand Lodges in amity with the United Grand Lodge of England deny the Church's claims, stating that \"Freemasonry does not seek to replace a Mason's religion or provide a substitute for it.\"\nIn contrast to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections are more likely to be based on allegations of mysticism, occultism, and even Satanism. Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although undoubtedly learned, was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore, an opinion grounded in the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the US. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.\nIn 1993, the Southern Baptist Convention's Home Mission Board determined that some parts of freemasonry are incompatible with Christianity, while others are compatible, concluding that participation in freemasonry should be considered \"a matter of personal conscience\". The topic of Freemasonry remains controversial within the convention. James L. Holly, president of Mission and Ministry to Men, published a three volume book series titled \"The Southern Baptist Convention and Freemasonry\", critiquing the report to the Southern Baptist Convention in addition to the influence of Gary Leazer, then Director of the Interfaith Witness Department of the North American Mission Board. Gary Leazer published \"Fundamentalism and Freemasonry\", arguing that the convention's discussion of Freemasonry was influenced by Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence.\nFree Methodist Church founder B.T. Roberts was a vocal opponent of Freemasonry in the mid 19th century. Roberts opposed the society on moral grounds and stated, \"The god of the lodge is not the God of the Bible.\" Roberts believed Freemasonry was a \"mystery\" or \"alternate\" religion and encouraged his church not to support ministers who were Freemasons. Freedom from secret societies is one of the \"frees\" upon which the Free Methodist Church was founded.\nSince the founding of Freemasonry, many Bishops of the Church of England have been Freemasons, including Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher. In the past, few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practising Freemasonry. In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, while being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England. In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.\nIn 1933, the Orthodox Church of Greece officially declared that being a Freemason constitutes an act of apostasy and thus, until he repents, the person involved with Freemasonry cannot partake of the Eucharist. This has been generally affirmed throughout the whole Eastern Orthodox Church. The Orthodox critique of Freemasonry agrees with both the Catholic and Protestant versions: \"Freemasonry cannot be at all compatible with Christianity as far as it is a secret organisation, acting and teaching in mystery and secret and deifying rationalism.\"\nRegular Freemasonry has traditionally not responded to these claims, beyond the often-repeated statement that Freemasonry explicitly adheres to the principle that \"Freemasonry is not a religion, nor a substitute for religion. There is no separate 'Masonic deity,' and there is no separate proper name for a deity in Freemasonry.\"\nChristian men, who were discouraged from joining the Freemasons by their Churches or who wanted a more religiocentric society, joined similar fraternal organisations, such as the Knights of Columbus and Knights of Peter Claver for Catholics, and the Royal Black Institution for Protestants, although these fraternal organisations have been \"organized in part on the style of and use many symbols of Freemasonry\".\nThere are some elements of Freemasonry within the temple rituals of Mormonism.\nIslam and Freemasonry.\nOttoman Caliph Mahmud I outlawed Freemasonry in the Ottoman Empire in 1748 and since that time Freemasonry was equated with atheism in the Ottoman Empire and the broader Islamic world.\nMany Islamic anti-Masonic arguments are closely tied to antisemitic conspiracy theories, though other criticisms are made, such as linking Freemasonry to Al-Masih ad-Dajjal (the false Messiah in Islamic Scripture). Syrian-Egyptian Islamic theologian M\u016bhamm\u0101d Rash\u012bd Rid\u00e2 (1865\u20131935) played the crucial role in leading the opposition to Freemasonry across the Islamic world during the early twentieth century. Influenced by Rida, Islamic anti-Masons argue that Freemasonry promotes the interests of the Jews around the world and that one of its aims is to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in order to rebuild the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. Through his popular pan-Islamic journal \"Al-Manar\", Rashid Rida spread anti-Masonic ideas which would directly influence the Muslim Brotherhood and subsequent Islamist movements, such as Hamas. In article 28 of its Covenant, Hamas states that Freemasonry, Rotary, and other similar groups \"work in the interest of Zionism and according to its instructions ...\"\nSeveral predominantly Muslim countries have banned Freemasonry within their borders, while others have not. Turkey and Morocco have established Grand Lodges, while in countries such as Malaysia and Lebanon, there are District Grand Lodges operating under a warrant from an established Grand Lodge. In 1972, in Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, then Prime Minister of Pakistan, placed a ban on Freemasonry. Lodge buildings were confiscated by the government.\nMasonic lodges existed in Iraq as early as 1917, when the first lodge under the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) was opened. Nine lodges under UGLE existed by the 1950s, and a Scottish lodge was formed in 1923. However, the position changed following the revolution, and all lodges were forced to close in 1965. This position was later reinforced under Saddam Hussein; the death penalty was \"prescribed\" for those who \"promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organisations.\"\nPolitical opposition.\nIn 1799, English Freemasonry almost came to a halt due to Parliamentary proclamation. In the wake of the French Revolution, the Unlawful Societies Act banned any meetings of groups that required their members to take an oath or obligation.\nThe Grand Masters of both the Moderns and the Antients Grand Lodges called on Prime Minister William Pitt (who was not a Freemason) and explained to him that Freemasonry was a supporter of the law and lawfully constituted authority and was much involved in charitable work. As a result, Freemasonry was specifically exempted from the terms of the Act, provided that each private lodge's Secretary placed with the local \"Clerk of the Peace\" a list of the members of his lodge once a year. This continued until 1967, when the obligation of the provision was rescinded by Parliament.\nFreemasonry in the United States faced political pressure following the 1826 kidnapping of William Morgan by Freemasons and his subsequent disappearance. Reports of the \"Morgan Affair\", together with opposition to Jacksonian democracy (Andrew Jackson was a prominent Mason), helped fuel an Anti-Masonic movement. The short-lived Anti-Masonic Party was formed, which fielded candidates for the presidential elections of 1828 and 1832.\nIn Italy, Freemasonry has become linked to a scandal concerning the Propaganda Due lodge (a.k.a. P2). This lodge was chartered by the Grande Oriente d'Italia in 1877, as a lodge for visiting Masons unable to attend their own lodges. Under Licio Gelli's leadership, in the late 1970s, P2 became involved in the financial scandals that nearly bankrupted the Vatican Bank. However, by this time the lodge was operating independently and irregularly, as the Grand Orient had revoked its charter and expelled Gelli in 1976.\nConspiracy theorists have long associated Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly in control of world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism and suppression from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g., the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).\nFreemasonry is viewed with distrust even in some modern democracies. In the UK, Masons working in the justice system, such as judges and police officers, were required to disclose their membership from 1999 to 2009. While a parliamentary inquiry found that there had been no evidence of wrongdoing, the government believed that Masons' potential loyalties to support fellow Masons should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership by applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.\nFreemasonry is both successful and controversial in France. As of the early 21st century, membership is rising, but reporting of it in popular media is often negative.\nIn some countries, anti-Masonry is often related to antisemitism and anti-Zionism. For example, in 1980, the Iraqi legal and penal code was changed by Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath Party, making it a felony to \"promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including Freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organisations\". Professor Andrew Prescott of the University of Sheffield writes: \"Since at least the time of \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", antisemitism has gone hand in hand with anti-masonry, so it is not surprising that allegations that 11 September was a Zionist plot have been accompanied by suggestions that the attacks were inspired by a masonic world order\".\nThe Holocaust.\nThe preserved records of the \"Reichssicherheitshauptamt\" (the Reich Security Main Office) show the persecution of Freemasons during the Holocaust. RSHA Amt VII (Written Records), overseen by Professor Franz Six, was responsible for \"ideological\" tasks, by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-Masonic propaganda. While the number of victims is not accurately known, historians estimate that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were killed under the Nazi regime. Masonic concentration camp inmates were classified as political prisoners and wore an inverted red triangle. Hitler believed Freemasons had succumbed to Jews conspiring against Germany.\nThe forget-me-not flower was first used by the Grand Lodge \"Zur Sonne\" in 1926, as a Masonic emblem at the annual convention in Bremen, Germany. In 1938, a forget-me-not badge, made by the same factory as the Masonic badge, was chosen for the Nazi Party's \"Winterhilfswerk\", the annual charity drive of the National Socialist People's Welfare (the welfare branch of the Nazi party). This coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear the forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of membership.\nAfter World War II, the forget-me-not flower was used again as a Masonic emblem in 1948 at the first Annual Convention of the United Grand Lodges of Germany in 1948. The badge is now sometimes worn in the coat lapel by Freemasons around the world to remember all who suffered in the name of Freemasonry, especially those during the Nazi era."}

The club competes in the , the top tier of English football. They have played home games at Craven Cottage since 1896, other than a two-year period spent at Loftus Road whilst Craven Cottage underwent redevelopments that were completed in 2004. They contest West London derby rivalries with Chelsea, Brentford and Queens Park Rangers. The club adopted a white shirt and black shorts as its kit in 1903, which has been used ever since.\nFounded in 1879, they are London's oldest professional football club. They joined the Southern League in 1898 and won two First Division titles (1905\u201306 and 1906\u201307), as well as two Second Division titles and a Western League title. Elected into the Second Division of the Football League in 1907, Fulham would win the Third Division South in 1931\u201332, four years after being relegated. They won the Second Division title in 1948\u201349, though were relegated after three seasons. Promoted back to the First Division again in 1958\u201359, the form of star player Johnny Haynes helped Fulham to remain in the top-flight until consecutive relegations occurred by 1969. They were promoted in 1970\u201371 and went on to reach the final of the 1974\u201375 FA Cup.\nFulham drifted between the second and fourth tiers until being taken over by Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1997. They went on to win two divisional titles in three seasons to reach the Premier League by 2001. They won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2002 and were beaten in the 2010 final of the UEFA Europa League. However, thirteen consecutive seasons in the top-flight culminated in relegation in 2014. Since that time, the club have moved between the first and second tiers under new owner Shahid Khan. Fulham had changed divisions in five successive seasons between 2017\u201318 to 2021\u201322, being relegated after winning the 2018 and 2020 EFL Championship play-off finals. They then won the 2021\u201322 EFL Championship title, finally settling in the Premier League, where they have played since 2022.\nHistory.\n1879\u20131907: Formation and Southern League years.\nFulham were formed in 1879 as Fulham St Andrew's Church Sunday School F.C., founded by worshippers (mostly adept at cricket) at the Church of England on Star Road, West Kensington (St Andrew's, Fulham Fields). Fulham's mother church still stands today with a plaque commemorating the team's foundation. They won the West London Amateur Cup in 1887 and, having shortened the name from Fulham St Andrews to its present form in December 1888, they then won the West London League in 1893 at the first attempt. One of the club's first ever kits was half red, half white shirts with white shorts worn in the 1886\u201387 season. Fulham started playing at their current ground at Craven Cottage in 1896, their first game against now defunct rivals Minerva.\nThe club gained professional status on 12 December 1898, the same year that they were admitted into the Southern League's Second Division. They were the third club from London to turn professional, following Arsenal, then named Royal Arsenal 1891, and Millwall in 1893. They adopted a red and white kit during the 1896\u201397 season. In 1902\u201303, the club won promotion from this division, entering the Southern League First Division. The club's first recorded all-white club kit came in 1903, and ever since then the club has been playing in all-white shirts and black shorts, with socks going through various evolutions of black and/or white, but are now normally white-only. The club won the Southern League twice, in 1905\u201306 and 1906\u201307.\n1907\u20131949: Football League.\nFulham joined The Football League after the second of their Southern League triumphs. The club's first league game, playing in the Second Division's 1907\u201308 season, saw them lose 1\u20130 at home to Hull City in September 1907. The first win came a few days later at Derby County's Baseball Ground by a score line of 1\u20130. Fulham finished the season three points short of promotion in fourth place. The club progressed all the way to the semi-final of that season's FA Cup, a run that included an 8\u20133 away win at Luton Town. In the semi-final, however, they were heavily beaten, 6\u20130, by Newcastle United. This is still a record loss for an FA Cup semi-final game. Two years later, the club won the London Challenge Cup in the 1909\u201310 season. Fulham's first season in Division Two turned out to be the highest that the club would finish for 21 years, until in 1927\u201328 when the club were relegated to the 3rd Division South, created in 1920. Hussein Hegazi, an Egyptian forward, was one of the first non-British players to appear in The Football League, though he only played one game for Fulham in 1911, marked with a goal, afterwards playing for non-league Dulwich Hamlet.\nDuring this period, businessman and politician Henry Norris was the club chairman and curiously he had an indirect role in the foundation of Fulham's local rivals Chelsea. When he rejected an offer from businessman Gus Mears to move Fulham to land where the present-day Chelsea stadium Stamford Bridge is situated, Mears decided to create his own team to occupy the ground. In 1910, Norris started to combine his role at Fulham with the chairmanship of Arsenal. Fulham became the first British team to sell hot dogs at their ground in 1926. Fulham had several high-profile international players during the 1920s, including Len Oliver and Albert Barrett.\nAfter finishing fifth, seventh and ninth (out of 22 teams) in their first three seasons in the Third Division South, Fulham won the division in the 1931\u201332 season. In doing so they beat Torquay United 10\u20132, won 24 out of 42 games and scored 111 goals, thus being promoted back to the Second Division. The next season they missed out on a second consecutive promotion, finishing third behind Tottenham Hotspur and Stoke City. A mixed bag of league performances followed, although the club also reached another FA Cup semi-final during the 1935\u201336 season. Fulham were also to draw with Austria in 1936 before Anschluss. On 8 October 1938, Craven Cottage saw its all-time highest attendance at a match against Millwall, with a crowd of 49,335 watching the game.\nLeague and cup football were severely disrupted by the outbreak of World War II in 1939, with the Football League split into regional divisions temporarily, with a national Football League War Cup and a London War Cup up for grabs. Craven Cottage was used like many grounds for fitness and training of the army youth reserves. Post-war, a full league programme was only restored for 1946\u201347. In the third season of what is now considered the modern era of football, Fulham finished top of the Second Division, with a win\u2013loss\u2013draw record of 24\u20139\u20139 (identical to that which won them the Third Division South 17 years previously). John Fox Watson made a pioneering transfer to Real Madrid in 1948, becoming one of the first players from the United Kingdom to sign for a high-profile side abroad.\n1949\u20131970: First Division Cottagers.\nPromotion to the top tier of English football saw the club perform poorly, finishing 17th in their first year and 18th in their second. In only their third season of First Division football, Fulham finished rock bottom of the 22-team league in the 1951\u201352 season, winning only eight of 42 games. On 20 May 1951, Fulham played one of their first ever games in North America in an exhibition match against Celtic at Delorimier Stadium in Montreal in front of 29,000 spectators.\nPossibly the single most influential character in Fulham's history is Johnny Haynes. \"Mr. Fulham\" or \"The Maestro\", as Haynes later came to be known, signed for The Cottagers as a schoolboy in 1950, making his first team debut on Boxing Day against Southampton at Craven Cottage in the 1951/52 relegation season. Haynes played for another 18 years, notching 657 appearances (along with many other club records too), his last appearance for Fulham coming on 17 January 1970. He is often considered as the greatest player in Fulham history, and never played for another team in Britain. He gained 56 caps for England (22 as captain), with many being earned while playing for Fulham in the Second Division. Haynes was injured in a car accident in Blackpool in 1962, but by his own admissions never regained the fitness or form to play for England again, missing out on England's victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup for which he would have stood a chance of being selected. The Stevenage Road Stand was renamed in his honour after his death in a car crash in 2005.\nFulham reached the 1957\u201358 FA Cup semi-finals, the best cup run of Haynes' career and nearest he came to a major trophy win playing in England. They were eliminated in a replay by the remnants of Manchester United's Busby Babes team that had been decimated in the Munich air disaster the month before. United were the first top division team Fulham played in that cup run. Fulham won promotion back to the First Division in the following season by finishing second to Sheffield Wednesday. Also joining Fulham in 1958 was Graham Leggat, who went on to score 134 goals in 277 appearances, (making him the club's fifth all-time top scorer). In the 1959\u201360 season, they achieved tenth position in the First Division, which until finishing ninth in the 2003\u201304 season was their highest-ever league position. This accompanied another appearance in the last four of the FA Cup in 1962.\nBy this time, the club were regularly playing in front of 30,000 plus crowds at Craven Cottage, despite struggling in the league.\nThe club earned a reputation for constantly battling against relegation most seasons, with numerous narrow escapes; none more so than in 1965\u201366. On the morning of 26 February 1966, Fulham were bottom with just 15 points from 29 matches. The last 13 games saw Fulham win nine and draw two to reach safety. Eventually, however, the club suffered relegation in the 1967\u201368 season, having won just ten out of their 42 games. Even that, however, was not as catastrophic as the calamity of next season. Winning only seven in 42, the club were relegated to the Third Division.\n1970\u20131994: Mixed fortunes outside the top flight.\nThe aforementioned Third Division hiatus lasted only two seasons before the club was promoted back to the Second Division as runners-up in 1970\u201371. This spell also saw Fulham invited to the Anglo-Italian Cup, which saw the club draw four out of four games in 1972\u201373 season. This preceded a period of high-profile signings for the club under Alec Stock in the mid-1970s, including Alan Mullery and Bobby Moore. Fulham reached their only FA Cup final to date in 1975, having won their first semi-final in five attempts. The club lost 2\u20130 to West Ham United in the final at Wembley Stadium. This gained the club qualification for another European tournament, the Anglo-Scottish Cup, where they reached the final, losing to Middlesbrough.\nGeorge Best played 47 times for the club in the 1976\u201377 season. Rodney Marsh, who having grown up with Fulham in the 1960s went on to play First Division football and play for England, rejoined the club in the same season, playing only 16 games. This capped one of the most successful eras in Fulham history.\nThe club were relegated again after winning only 11 in 42 matches in the 1979\u201380 season, which eventually resulted in Bobby Campbell's dismissal in October 1980, to be replaced by Malcolm Macdonald. With a strong squad during his 1980\u20131984 period in charge (with players such as Ray Houghton, Tony Gale, Paul Parker, Gerry Peyton and Ray Lewington), they won promotion again in 1981\u201382 back to the Second Division, although the promotion was overshadowed by the suicide of former defender Dave Clement a few weeks before promotion was sealed.\nIn 1980, Fulham founded the rugby league club that is now London Broncos designed to be an extra stream of income for the football club, but which made financial losses every year while linked to Fulham F.C. Then called \"Fulham Rugby League,\" they played at Craven Cottage until moving away from the parent club in 1984.\nIn 1978, Fulham had signed Gordon \"Ivor\" Davies who, during two spells at Fulham, became the club's leading goalscorer of all time with a total of 178 goals in all competitions; the record still stands. Fulham narrowly missed out on back-to-back promotions to the First Division, losing 1\u20130 to Derby County away on the last day of the 1982\u201383 season \u2013 although the match was abandoned after 88 minutes due to a pitch invasion and inexplicably never replayed or finished. The side which had shown so much promise was quickly sold off as the club were in debt, so it was little surprise when the club were relegated again to the Third Division in 1986. The club nearly went out of business in 1987 via an ill-advised merger attempt with Queens Park Rangers. It was only the intervention of ex-player Jimmy Hill that allowed the club to stay in business by formation of a new company, Fulham FC (1987) Ltd. In 1987, the club took part in what was then the longest penalty deciders ever recorded \u2013 it needed 28 spot kicks to sort out a winner between them and Aldershot following a Football League Trophy match. This record went on to be broken by Fulham when they played at championship side Preston in the carabao cup in 2024 taking 31 spot kicks to separate the two sides.\nIn 1992, the foundation of the Premier League, and the resignation of 22 clubs from The Football League, restored Fulham to that league's Second Division. However, the club were relegated to the new Third Division after a poor 1993\u201394 season, following which Ian Branfoot was appointed as team manager.\n1994\u20131997: Fulham's lowest ebb.\nAfter an eighth-place finish in Branfoot's first season in charge, the club hit its lowest-ever final league position in the 1995\u201396 season, finishing 17th out of 24.&lt;ref name=\"Final 1994/1995 Football League Two Table\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Final 1995/1996 Football League Two Table\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Branfoot was dismissed as manager, but remained at the club in other capacities for a short while. In February 1996, Micky Adams became player-manager. Adams oversaw an upturn in form that lifted the side out of relegation danger. The next season, he engineered a second-place league finish, missing out on first place because several years previously the league had dropped the old \"goal difference\" system in favour of a \"goals scored\" tally, meaning Fulham finished behind Wigan Athletic. The club's chairman Jimmy Hill had argued in 1992 that goals scored should decide places of teams tied on points, and the Football League clubs had voted the system in.\n1997\u20132001: Al-Fayed takeover.\nEgyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed bought the club for \u00a36.75\u00a0million in the summer of 1997. The club was purchased via Bill Muddyman's Muddyman Group. Al-Fayed had Micky Adams replaced in the aftermath of a mid-table start to the season. He installed a two-tier management \"dream team\" of Ray Wilkins as First Team Manager and Kevin Keegan as chief operating officer, pledging that the club would reach the Premier League within five years. After an argument over team selection, Wilkins left the club in May 1998 to hand over the full managerial duties to Keegan. Keegan then helped steer the club to promotion the next season, winning 101 points out of a possible 138, after spending \u00a31.1\u00a0million to sign Paul Peschisolido from West Bromwich Albion. Peschisolido was top scorer and captained by Chris Coleman \u2013 then the most expensive footballer outside the top two divisions of the English league.\nIn 1999, Keegan left Fulham to become manager of England, and Paul Bracewell was put in charge.\nBracewell was dismissed in March 2000, as Fulham's promising early season form dwindled away to a mid-table finish. Frenchman Jean Tigana was put in charge and, having signed a number of young stars (including French striker Louis Saha), he guided Fulham to their third promotion in five seasons in the 2000\u201301 season, giving Fulham top-flight status for the first time since 1968. Fulham once again amassed 101 points out of a possible 138 in their scintillating title run, which was crowned with an open-top bus parade down Fulham Palace Road. They are the only team to have twice reached 100 points in a season. During the season, Chris Coleman was involved in a car crash that put him out of action for well over a year and eventually ended his playing career after he failed to make a sufficient recovery. Fulham's run through the divisions saw a large turnover of players, with the only player to play for the club in all four leagues being Sean Davis.\n2001\u20132007: Early Premier League years.\nFulham returned to the top division of English football, and competed in the Premier League for the first time. The club finished the 2001\u201302 season in 13th place. Fulham were the only team to host top-flight football with some standing areas in the 21st century, but due to restrictions on standing, this was not allowed to continue; clubs promoted from the second division had only three years to make their ground all-seater. Fulham were forced to groundshare with QPR at Loftus Road during the 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304 seasons while Craven Cottage was rebuilt as an all-seated stadium. There were fears that Fulham would not return to the Cottage, after it was revealed that Al-Fayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm.\nIn 2002\u201303, Fulham spent most of the season in the lower half of the table. Chairman Al-Fayed told manager Jean Tigana that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. However, with five games left to play and relegation still possible, Tigana was dismissed, and Chris Coleman was temporarily put in charge. Fulham won 10 points from a possible 15 and managed to avoid relegation. Coleman was appointed manager on a permanent basis in the summer of 2003; despite predictions that the inexperience of Coleman would result in Fulham's relegation, he kept the club well clear of relegation, guiding them to a club record ninth-place finish in his debut season. This might have been greater had the club not come under significant financial pressure to sell Louis Saha to Manchester United, for whom they received a then club record \u00a313\u00a0million.\nFulham lost a legal case against former manager Tigana in 2004 after Al-Fayed wrongly alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than \u00a37\u00a0million for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret.\nColeman notched up another satisfactory performance in the 2004\u201305 season and guided Fulham to a secure 13th-place finish. The following season Fulham improved by one place, finishing 12th \u2013 the high point of the season was a 1\u20130 win over local rivals and reigning champions Chelsea in the West London derby \u2013 Chelsea had only lost two games in two and a half years. The 2006\u201307 season proved to be Coleman's last, as on 10 April 2007, Fulham terminated his contract with immediate effect. His replacement was Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez. Fulham only gained four points from five games with Sanchez as caretaker manager. They ensured top-flight survival that season by defeating a weakened Liverpool side 1\u20130 in the penultimate match of the season, and Sanchez was appointed manager.\n2007\u20132010: Hodgson's transformation.\nSanchez received strong financial backing from the board and made a number of signings during the summer break, but, after just two league wins in the first five months of the season and with Fulham in the relegation zone, he was dismissed on 21 December 2007 after a defeat to Newcastle United. Roy Hodgson was named as the new manager of Fulham on 28 December 2007 and took up his contractual duties on 30 December, just two days before the January transfer window opened.\nHodgson's tenure did not start well and it took a month to secure his first win, against Aston Villa, courtesy of a Jimmy Bullard free-kick. Fulham continued to struggle and a 3\u20131 home defeat in April at the hands of fellow strugglers Sunderland left Hodgson on the verge of tears in the post-match press conference and many pundits writing off Fulham's survival chances. Despite the negative press, Hodgson continued to believe survival was attainable. The turning point of the season came in the third-to-last match, against Manchester City. Fulham trailed 2\u20130 at half-time and had the Premier League scores at that time become results, they would have been relegated. However, the introduction of Diomansy Kamara heralded the start of a fantastic comeback\u2014Kamara struck twice as Fulham registered an amazing 3\u20132 victory. Fulham then won a crucial match against fellow strugglers Birmingham City at Craven Cottage, leaving survival in the club's own hands. Barring a goal-rush from fellow strugglers Reading, a win against a Portsmouth side looking ahead to their fourth FA Cup final would guarantee survival.\nWith 15 minutes to play at Portsmouth, Fulham were drawing, and with Birmingham City and Reading leading comfortably against Blackburn Rovers and Derby County respectively, they looked likely to be relegated. However, Fulham earned a free-kick with 76 minutes played; Jimmy Bullard's delivery found Danny Murphy, who headed home the decisive goal, sparking manic celebrations from the travelling fans. Hodgson had ensured survival against all odds, breaking several club records in the process and cementing his place in Fulham folklore. Fulham narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place via Fairplay by a dubious 0.8 of a point behind Manchester City, who lost 8\u20131 at Middlesbrough.\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, Fulham finished seventh, their highest-ever league placing, earning qualification for the inaugural UEFA Europa League, the second time that the club had entered a UEFA competition.\n2009\u201310 was arguably the most successful season in the club's history. They were eliminated from the FA Cup in the quarter-finals for the second year running, and finished 12th in the Premier League, despite fielding weakened teams in the last few matches. In the inaugural Europa League season, however, Fulham reached the final, meeting Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, who had dropped down from the Champions League, at the Volksparkstadion in Hamburg. In their first European cup final, the Cottagers were beaten 2\u20131 after extra time, having drawn 1\u20131 after full-time. The achievement of taking Fulham so unexpectedly far, beating famous teams like Hamburger SV, Juventus, holders Shakhtar Donetsk and Basel in the competition, led to Roy Hodgson being voted the LMA Manager of the Year by the widest margin in the history of the award. The home match in the round of 16 was arguably Fulham's greatest result in the history of the club. Despite losing 3\u20131 in the first leg at Italian giants Juventus and falling behind minutes into the second leg at Craven Cottage, Fulham scored four goals with no reply from Juventus.\nAt the end of the season, Hodgson left Fulham to manage Liverpool.\n2010\u20132013: Established in the Premier League.\nOn 29 July 2010, Mark Hughes was named the successor to Hodgson, signing a two-year contract with the club. Hughes had previously managed Manchester City, the Welsh national team and Blackburn. Hughes' first match in charge was against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium. The highlight of the season was a 4\u20130 win in the FA Cup over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, all goals coming in the first half. Hughes resigned as manager of Fulham on 2 June 2011, having spent fewer than 11 months at the club. The Whites had an encouraging finish in eighth position and qualified for the Europa League via Fairplay.\nOn 7 June 2011, Martin Jol signed a two-year contract with Fulham, becoming successor to Hughes. Jol's first match was a 3\u20130 Europa League win against NS\u00cd Runav\u00edk of the Faroe Islands on 30 June. Fulham then navigated their way with some ease to the group stage in the Europa League through late summer. However, the Cottagers were knocked out with the last seconds of the group stage matches, Odense Boldklub equalising to make a draw, leaving Fulham in third place, with Polish side Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w instead progressing to the next round.\nFulham's Premier League form in the 2011\u201312 season was mixed, with the continuing away-record hangover of previous seasons dragging on. In October 2011, Fulham had an emphatic 6\u20130 home win over neighbours QPR, with Andrew Johnson scoring a hat-trick for Fulham in the match. The January 2012 transfer window saw Bobby Zamora move over the Hammersmith flyover to Loftus Road, with Russian striker Pavel Pogrebnyak coming in place from VfB Stuttgart.\nThe New Year saw two further hat-tricks scored by Clint Dempsey. On 11 February 2012, Progrebnyak scored on his debut in the 2\u20131 win over Stoke City. In March 2012, a 5\u20130 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers saw a hat-trick from Pogrebnyak. The Cottagers broke their historic drought on Merseyside with a 1\u20130 win over Liverpool at Anfield on May Day and another win against Sunderland in the last home game meant Fulham were only one point short of equalling their largest points haul in the Premier League, with just one game remaining. However, they failed to achieve this after losing their last game away at Tottenham.\nIn the 2012\u201313 season, Fulham ended a seven-match winless run by beating Swansea City 3\u20130 away at the Liberty Stadium on the final game of the season on 19 May 2013. Fulham finished the season in 12th place.\n2013\u2013present: Shahid Khan's ownership.\nShahid Khan took over as chairman in July 2013, but after a poor start to the 2013\u201314 season, having only amassed 10 points from 13 games, Martin Jol was dismissed as manager in December 2013, with Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen taking charge as head coach. Meulensteen was replaced by Felix Magath after just 17 games in charge following no upturn in form, but fortunes did not improve, and Fulham were eventually relegated to the Championship after a 4\u20131 defeat away to Stoke on 3 May.\nFulham broke the Championship transfer record that summer in a restructuring of the squad by Magath, but after a disastrous start to the new season, amassing just one point in seven games, Magath was dismissed in September 2014, with Kit Symons appointed as caretaker manager. Fulham eventually finished the season in 17th place. The team suffered an inconsistent start to the following season and after a 5\u20132 loss at home to Birmingham City, and lying in 12th place, Kit Symons was dismissed as manager in November 2015. It paved the way for Serbian Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107 to be appointed on 27 December 2015. Fulham's fortunes did not improve greatly following Jokanovi\u0107's appointment, but the team finished the 2015\u201316 Championship season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by 11 points.\nThe 2016\u201317 season saw huge improvements in both results and performances. Despite an inconsistent start, the team saw a significant improvement from October onwards which saw them secure a 6th-place finish. They entered the play-offs, but lost to Reading 2\u20131 on aggregate in the semi-final. During this time, club owner Shahid Khan's son Tony Khan was named as Vice Chairman and Director of Football Operations, and he also holds the roles of General Manager and Sporting Director. Despite a slow start to the following season, the club went on a club-record 23 game unbeaten run in the league which led to a 3rd-place finish, narrowly missing out automatic promotion. The team went on to win the EFL Championship play-off final against Aston Villa to return to the Premier League on 26 May 2018.\nDuring the season, the club signed Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107, initially on loan until the end of the season. Mitrovi\u0107 would go on to score more than 100 goals for the club, becoming the eighth player in Fulham's history to do so.\nFollowing a poor start to life back in the Premier League, Jokanovi\u0107 was dismissed in November 2018 and replaced with former Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri. Results ultimately did not improve under Ranieri, as well as him alienating several key players, and he left the club in February 2019. He was replaced by Scott Parker as caretaker manager who could not save the club from relegation on 3 April 2019. Parker was appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 10 May 2019. In a season that was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Parker led the club straight back to the Premier League on 4 August 2020, defeating London rivals Brentford 2\u20131 in the play-off final after a fourth-place finish. However, the club would once again be relegated after just a single season back in the top flight after a 2\u20130 defeat to Burnley on 10 May 2021.\nIn the aftermath of relegation, Parker left the club by mutual consent and was replaced by former Everton manager Marco Silva. After relegation, Fulham under Silva earned promotion back to the top tier with four games to go, winning the 2021\u201322 Championship title. Fulham started the 2022\u201323 Premier League season much better than prior years. At the halfway point, Fulham sat in 6th place, had tallied a 2\u20131 win over West London rivals Chelsea, whom they had not defeated in nearly 16 years, and collected a string of four consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since April 1966.\nGrounds.\nBetween the years 1879 and when Fulham had a ground to call their own in 1896, they played at a number of stadiums, only some of which were recorded and this should not be regarded as a full or complete list. Only rivals and former landlords Queens Park Rangers have played at more home stadiums. Some of the early grounds listed below are likely to have been parks and parkland, which have now been developed. Even when the club purchased Craven Cottage and the surrounding land in 1894, they had to wait two years before they could play a game there.\nClub identity.\nKit.\nFulham's sponsorship by Betfair in 2002\u201303 was the first gambling sponsorship in English football, and came before the Gambling Act 2005 permitted the industry to advertise on television and radio; within fifteen years half of Premier League teams were sponsored by such companies.\nOn 27 July 2021, it was announced that World Mobile would become the official principal partner for the next three years.\nIn July 2022, it was announced that the gambling company W88 would sponsor the team in a kit deal for the 2022\u201323 season. The deal saw the betting firm's logo placed on the front of both the men's and women's kit. The confirmation of the deal came during a decrease in gambling sponsors for Premier League teams. In June 2023, it was announced that betting company SBOBET would replace W88 as the team's main sponsor for the 2023\u201324 season. In Feb 2024, it was announced that FlyFish Limited become official partner.\nMascot.\nThe Fulham mascot is Billy the Badger, who was the winning design sent in by Kyle Jackson after an online competition by the club. Billy the Badger wears the number 79 Fulham shirt, in reference to the club's year of founding, 1879. Controversy first surrounded Billy when he tried to cheer up Chelsea manager Avram Grant during a home match in front of the television cameras. Secondly, Billy was seen on television being sent off during the home game against Aston Villa on 3 February 2008 for break-dancing in the corner of the pitch after the referee had commenced the game. Billy blamed his badger hearing and eyesight for the incident, and apologised to referee Chris Foy. On 11 March 2009, Billy walked across the goal during a match although it was not spotted by the referee. The former mascot for Fulham was Sir Craven of Cottage, the Knight. The cheerleaders were known as the Cravenettes.\nRivalries and supporters.\nFulham fans consider their main rivals to be Chelsea. Despite this fixture not being played that often in the years preceding Fulham's ascent to the top division, this is a clear local derby as Chelsea's ground, Stamford Bridge, is within Fulham and only 1.8 miles from Craven Cottage.\nFulham consider their secondary rivals to be Queens Park Rangers. Fulham beat QPR twice in the 2011\u201312 Premier League season. They won 6\u20130 at Craven Cottage, and also 1\u20130 away from home at Loftus Road. The two clubs have played each other several times since in the Championship.\nFulham's third closest rivalry is with Brentford, who they defeated 2\u20131 on 4 August 2020 in the Championship play-off final. Fulham also have rivalries with several other London clubs to a lesser extent, such as Crystal Palace.\nOutside of London, Gillingham are still considered rivals to some Fulham supporters despite the two clubs not having played in the same division since the 2000\u201301 season. Fulham and Gillingham were involved in several ill-tempered matches in the lower leagues, including the death of a Fulham supporter.\nFulham's fan base has fluctuated over the years, with high crowds coinciding with the club's success in the Premier League. Fulham supporters have played a vital role in the club's long term stay at Craven Cottage. When the club moved temporarily to Loftus Road, a committee known as Back to the Cottage was formed, committed to ensuring the club continued to play at their traditional home. Fulham fans have traditionally come from the Fulham and Hammersmith areas, and also from other areas in South-West London, such as Putney, Richmond, Sutton and Worcester Park.\nIn July 2012, the club website asked supporters using Facebook and Twitter to pick their best FFC Premier League XI from 2001 to the present. The supporters picked their favourite goalkeeper, full-backs, centre-backs, wingers, centre midfielders and forwards in a classic 4\u20134\u20132 formation. In August 2022, the club asked fans for an updated all time Premier League XI as part of the Premier League's 30th anniversary celebrations.\nRecords and statistics.\nFulham in Europe.\nFulham are a member of the European Club Association, having qualified four times for European Competition, firstly the UEFA Intertoto Cup after their inaugural season in the Premier League, then the UEFA Cup as a result of winning that, and then the UEFA Europa League twice. Fulham are unbeaten at home in European competition, in 23 games, with a record of 17 wins and six draws. In 2010, Fulham reached the UEFA Europa League final, which they lost 2\u20131 to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\nClub management.\nManagerial history.\nFulham have had 37 managers in 114 years. Prior to the appointment of the first manager at the club (Bradshaw in 1904), the duties normally assigned to a modern-day manager would have been shared between club secretary, captain, and other officials.\nManagerial records:\nTemporary managers at the club have included:\nOwnership.\nFulham Football Club is owned by Shahid Khan. Khan completed his purchase of the club from Mohamed Al-Fayed on 12 July 2013 for a reported \u00a3150\u2013200 million.\nDuring his ownership of Fulham, Al-Fayed had provided the club with \u00a3187 million in interest-free loans. In March 2011, Fulham posted annual losses of \u00a316.9 million, with Al-Fayed stating that he would \"continue to make funds available to achieve our goals both on and off the pitch\" and that \"the continued success of Fulham and its eventual financial self-sustainability is my priority.\" Fulham were effectively debt-free as Al-Fayed converted the loans into equity in the club.\nHonours.\nLeague\nCup\nMinor titles"}

They comprised Holly Johnson (vocals), Paul Rutherford (backing vocals), Mark O'Toole (bass), Brian Nash (guitar) and Peter Gill (drums). They were among the first openly gay pop acts and made gay rights and sexuality a theme of their music and performances.\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood signed to ZTT Records in 1983. Their debut album, \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" (1984), produced by Trevor Horn, achieved advance sales of more than a million, and their first three singles, \"Relax\", \"Two Tribes\" and \"The Power of Love\", reached number one on the UK singles chart. The BBC briefly banned them from broadcast for their provocative themes, drawing further publicity. In 2014, the music journalist Paul Lester wrote that \"no band has dominated a 12-month period like Frankie ruled 1984\".\nJohnson, Gill and O'Toole received the 1984 Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically for \"Two Tribes\". In 1985, Frankie Goes to Hollywood won the Brit Award for British Breakthrough Act and were nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood's second album, \"Liverpool\" (1986), sold fewer copies, and they disbanded acrimoniously in 1987. Johnson successfully sued ZTT to leave his contract and began a solo career. He declined invitations to reunite and tried to block the band from using the name. In 2004, Frankie Goes to Hollywood reunited without Johnson and Nash to perform at a Prince's Trust charity concert, with Ryan Molloy on vocals, and held a tour in 2005. They reunited with Johnson and Nash for the first time since 1987 to perform for the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest.\nHistory.\n1980\u20131982: Formation.\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood formed in Liverpool in 1980. The lead singer, Holly Johnson, had previously played in Big in Japan and had released some unsuccessful solo singles. He formed the first version of Frankie Goes to Hollywood with Phil Hurst (drums), Ambrose (bass), Steve Lovell (guitar), but the group soon split. The name came from an advertisement announcing Frank Sinatra's film debut.\nIn 1982, Johnson restarted the group with Peter Gill (drums) and the brothers Mark (bass) and Jed O'Toole (guitar). Jed left before 1983, and was replaced by his cousin, Brian Nash. Within the band, O'Toole, Nash and Gill constituted a group known as the Lads. Frankie Goes to Hollywood played their first gig at a Liverpool pub, Pickwick's, where they recruited the dancer and backing singer Paul Rutherford.\nNash said the band admired the Liverpool groups Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and the Teardrop Explodes: \"That was music from Liverpool but from our generation. You would see these people walking around town, you'd see Ian McCulloch getting on the bus. I never saw any of the Beatles on the bus.\"\n1983\u20131984: \"Relax\", \"Two Tribes\" and success.\nIn February 1983, Frankie Goes to Hollywood performed on the Channel 4 show \"The Tube\", dressed in fetish wear. That May, they became the first act signed by ZTT Records, a new record label co-founded by the producer Trevor Horn. Horn admired the \"dangerous\" sexuality of their music. \"Relax\" was selected as their first single. After recording several versions, Horn created a dramatically different arrangement without the band, using electronic instruments such as a drum machine and the Fairlight, an early sampling synthesiser.\n\"Relax\" was released in October 1983, backed by a music video set in an S&amp;M club. \"Sound on Sound\" described it as a \"hi-NRG brand of dance-synth-pop\" that \"broke new sonic ground, while epitomising '80s excess in all its garish, overblown glory\". Initial sales were slow, but rose after the band performed on the BBC series \"Top of the Pops\" the following January. Soon after, the BBC banned \"Relax\" from its broadcasts, deeming it obscene. The ban created publicity, associating Frankie Goes to Hollywood with youth rebellion. Within two weeks, \"Relax\" reached number one on the UK singles chart and stayed there for four weeks, and the BBC was forced to reverse its ban. \"Relax\" won the 1985 Brit Award for Best British Single.\nThe ZTT co-founder Paul Morley devised a promotional campaign involving \"advertising-based slogans, playful propaganda and pseudo-philosophy\". This included a line of T-shirts inspired by shirts created by Katharine Hamnett, bearing slogans such as \"Frankie say relax\" and \"Frankie say arm the unemployed\". Morley said he wanted to challenge the idea of music merchandise, asking: \"Why did it have to have a face on it, couldn't it be a walking billboard?\" The shirts quickly became popular, and \"Music Week\" reported in July 1984 that they were outselling the singles in some stores. By December, more than 250,000 T-shirts had been sold.\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood appeared in the 1984 thriller \"Body Double\" by Brian De Palma. In June, Frankie Goes to Hollywood released their second single, \"Two Tribes\", featuring an \"annihilating\" bassline and lyrics about the Cold War. Its music video, depicting a fight between Ronald Reagan and Konstantin Chernenko, was played extensively on MTV. The single spent nine weeks at number one on the UK singles chart. Frankie Goes to Hollywood held the top two spots of the chart simultaneously when \"Relax\" rose back to number two that August.\n1984\u20131985: \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\".\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood released their debut album, \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\", featuring \"Relax\" and \"Two Tribes\", in October 1984. It had advance sales of a million copies. A third single, the ballad \"The Power of Love\", was released in November and reached number one in December. This made Frankie Goes to Hollywood the second act in the history of the UK charts to reach number one with their first three singles, after another Liverpool band, Gerry and the Pacemakers, in the 1960s. This record remained unbeaten until the Spice Girls achieved a six-single streak in 1996\u20131997. Writing in the \"Guardian\" in 2014, Paul Lester wrote that \"no band has dominated a 12-month period like Frankie ruled 1984\". As of 2014, \"Relax\" and \"Two Tribes\" were the sixth and 22nd-bestselling singles in UK history.\nIn 1985, Frankie Goes to Hollywood won the Brit Award for British Breakthrough Act. In the US, where they were associated with the Second British Invasion, they received nominations for Best New Artist at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards and the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards. Their fourth single, \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\", was released in March 1985, and reached number two. That year, Ocean Software published a Frankie Goes to Hollywood game for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. The player completes a series of minigames to solve a murder mystery, with references to the band's lyrics, videos and artwork.\n1985\u20131986: \"Liverpool\" and decline.\nBy the end of 1984, following promotional touring in the United States, Johnson had distanced himself from the band. He spent time with his new boyfriend, Wolfgang Kuhle, who later became his manager. In 1985, Frankie Goes to Hollywood left the UK for a year for tax purposes and wrote songs for their second album in Ireland. The media reported that disputes had formed within the band. They began recording their second album, \"Liverpool\", in Wisseloord Studios, near Amsterdam, in November 1985. Between March and June 1986, they worked in ZTT's studio Sarm West in London. The album was produced by the ZTT engineer Stephen Lipson; Horn took over mixing in its final stages.\nJohnson remained distant from the band during the sessions and was unhappy about the album's focus on rock over dance. Jill Sinclair, Horn's wife and one of the ZTT founders, later alleged that Johnson had been uncooperative and absent for most of the sessions. According to Nash, Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon declined an invitation to replace Johnson. Pete Wylie was also approached, but Johnson remained and completed \"Liverpool\".\nIn August 1986, the first single from \"Liverpool\", \"Rage Hard\", was released, reaching number 4 in the UK. \"Liverpool\" was released in October 1986 and reached UK No.\u00a05. It received poor reviews and chart returns declined rapidly with the follow-up singles \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" (No.\u00a019) and \"Watching the Wildlife\" (No.\u00a028). Horn spent three months creating remixes of \"Watching the Wildlife\" and \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" for the single releases, spending an estimated \u00a350,000. By March 1988, \"Liverpool\" had sold around 800,000 copies.\n1987\u20131988: disbandment and lawsuit.\nDuring the \"Liverpool\" tour, the relationship between Johnson and the band deteriorated. Before a concert at Wembley Arena in January, a fight broke out backstage between Johnson and O'Toole. Johnson said that ZTT had encouraged the rift as a means of divide and rule, and that Horn had once suggested Johnson and Rutherford fire the other members and work as a duo. Sinclair instead blamed Johnson's manager and boyfriend, Kuhle, who she said was a negative influence and had triggered resentment in the band. Nash recalled: \"During the last tour, everybody knew it would end, as the relationship between Holly and the rest of us was so strained. He didn't want to be in a band situation anymore. Everybody was fed up with the whole thing.\" Their last concert was on 1 March 1987, at Rotterdam Ahoy in the Netherlands.\nOn 23 July, Johnson told ZTT that he planned to leave and sign to MCA Records. ZTT filed an injunction to prevent this, as their record contract specified that any member who left would remain contracted to ZTT. In court, ZTT argued that the success of Frankie Goes to Hollywood was a result of ZTT's production and marketing and that Johnson had been disruptive and uncooperative. Johnson's team argued that ZTT had been financially irresponsible when recording \"Liverpool\", and that their contract constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade. In 1988, the High Court found in Johnson's favour and the band members were released from their contract. Horn later wrote that his decision to pursue the lawsuit had been \"stupid\".\nSoon after the breakup, Nash, O'Toole and Gill attempted to re-form Frankie Goes to Hollywood with a new singer, Grant Boult. According to Nash, they recorded songs in a deal with London Records. Johnson blocked the project, saying it would devalue their achievements.\n1989\u2013present: solo projects.\nJohnson began a solo career with MCA, and released a number-one album, \"Blast\", in 1989. His second solo album, \"Dreams That Money Can't Buy\", released in 1991, was unsuccessful. That year, Johnson was diagnosed with HIV and retreated from public life to focus on his health. In 1994, he published an autobiography, \"A Bone in My Flute\". He has since released further albums and studied at the Royal College of Art.\nNash returned to work as an electrician, and signed to Swanyard Records to record music with Boult as Low. He later became an officiator of weddings and funerals and a tour guide of Liverpool's musical heritage. He published a memoir, \"Nasher Says Relax\", in 2012. O'Toole moved to Los Angeles, where he wrote and demoed new music, and later moved to Florida. Gill toured as part of an Australian soap actor's band, and formed a music production company, Love Station, which released singles featuring vocalists including Lisa Hunt.\nRutherford released a single, a cover of the Chic track \"I Want Your Love\", and an album, \"Oh World\", in 1989, which were unsuccessful. He released the single \"That Moon\" with Pressure Zone in 1991, and worked as a stylist for bands. He appeared in the music videos for \"Walking on Broken Glass\" (1992) by Annie Lennox and \"Give In to Me\" (1993) by Michael Jackson. He later moved to New Zealand.\n1998\u20132000: American impostor band.\nIn 1998, a band using the name Frankie Goes to Hollywood began to tour the United States. They were led by an American using the stage name Davey Johnson, who claimed he was Holly's brother and had performed uncredited on \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\". Horn and the members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood refuted both claims. O'Toole, who had been living in Florida, became aware of the impostor band and warned concert promoters not to hire them.\nThe Flock of Seagulls frontman Mike Score, who had been a Liverpool acquaintance of the members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, removed the impostor band from his tour. After Johnson contacted the trade magazine \"Pollstar\" to confirm that the act was unauthorised, they were dropped by a booking agent, but were booked by small clubs throughout the southern United States. In September 2000, a feature on the incident was published in \"Spin\". In 2000, ZTT released a Frankie Goes to Hollywood greatest-hits compilation, \"Maximum Joy\", featuring remixes by acts including Apollo 440.\n2003\u20132007: reunion, performances with Ryan Molloy and trademark dispute.\nThe members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood reunited in Holloway, London, for a 2003 episode of the VH1 show \"Bands Reunited\", but did not perform. In an interview the following year, Johnson said he had not wanted to perform with the band again and felt the episode was a \"debacle\". In his 2012 memoir, Nash, who had also been uninterested in a reunion, described the VH1 episode as a \"circus\" that had tried to depict Johnson negatively.\nOn 11 November 2004, Frankie Goes to Hollywood reunited without Johnson and Nash to perform at a Prince's Trust charity concert at Wembley Arena celebrating Horn's 25 years as a record producer. Johnson and Nash declined to take part. In his memoir, Nash wrote that he gave the band his blessing and watched from the audience. Following open auditions held on 31 October in Leicester Square, London, Ryan Molloy was selected as the new vocalist. O'Toole's brother Jed, who had played in the band in the 1980s, replaced Nash.\n\"PopMatters\" wrote that the Wembley performance had \"unstoppable 1984 pop glory\" and that \"even strong detractors of the group would likely be won over by energy the band members radiate\". The \"Independent\" wrote that it \"fell somewhat flat\". Writing in \"The Guardian\", Alexis Petridis wrote that the show \"ultimately underwhelms\" and that the songs \"were designed as studio-bound production extravaganzas, not live showstoppers\". Nash praised the performance and wrote that \"Molloy did a great job filling Holly's shoes\". In his memoir, Horn wrote that Molloy was \"a hell of a good frontman\".\nThe Wembley performance was followed by a series of concerts across Europe in 2005, including at Northampton Balloon Festival, and Big Gay Out in Finsbury Park, London. In 2006, Molloy said he had written new songs for Frankie Goes to Hollywood. However, the material went unreleased and a European tour was canceled. The group remained active until 2007 using the name Forbidden Hollywood, as Johnson would not allow them to use the original name.\nIn April 2004, Johnson attempted to register the name Frankie Goes to Hollywood as a trademark for his exclusive use, arguing that it was his intellectual property as he had used it for a previous band. The other band members opposed the registration. In 2007 it was blocked by an Intellectual Property Office judge, who ruled that Johnson had acted in bad faith in an attempt to prevent the band performing without him.\n2011\u20132023: reissues, reunion with Johnson and film.\nIn 2011, ZTT reissued \"Liverpool\" in an expanded edition, plus \"The Art of the 12\"\", a compilation of tracks from ZTT artists including Frankie Goes to Hollywood. In 2017, Universal Music purchased ZTT, including the Frankie Goes to Hollywood back catalogue.\nOn 7 May 2023, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, including Johnson and Nash, reunited for a concert featuring multiple acts celebrating Liverpool music for the Eurovision Song Contest. They performed one song, \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\". It was their first performance together since 1987. The performance drew praise but disappointed those hoping for more songs. The \"Telegraph\" gave the whole concert three out of five, writing about the segment by Frankie Goes to Hollywood that Johnson remained \"a commanding presence\" but that the short set was disappointing. The BBC wrote: \"Maybe one song is as much time as the five band members can bear to share a stage for\u2014but at least they proved that they and their music can still sound compelling and fresh.\"\nOn 10 May, Working Title Films announced it was developing a Frankie Goes to Hollywood biographical film, \"Relax\", based on Johnson's memoir. Bernard Rose, the director of the first \"Relax\" music video, is set to direct, with Callum Scott Howells as Johnson.\nStyle and legacy.\nJohnson and Rutherford are openly gay, and Frankie Goes to Hollywood made gay rights and sexuality a theme of their music and performances. They were connected to a rise in gay culture in 1980s Britain, alongside bands such as Bronski Beat. Morley said that Frankie Goes to Hollywood combined the \"exploratory gay energy\" of Johnson and Rutherford with the \"heterosexual scouse energy\" of the other band members. Bernard Rose, who directed the first \"Relax\" video, said Frankie Goes to Hollywood were the first openly gay major pop act, before gay artists such as Boy George, George Michael, Freddie Mercury or Elton John had come out, and \"caused a shockwave\".\nAs Frankie Goes to Hollywood rose in popularity, some outlets reported that they were a \"manufactured\" group controlled by ZTT. A 1984 article in the \"Washington Post\" described them as \"a modern-day Monkees, a post-punk Village People sprung forth fully armed from the brow of junk culture\". As only Johnson performed on the studio version of \"Relax\", and the band did not tour during 1984 at the height of their popularity, rumours spread that they could not play their instruments. Johnson said the media had undermined them and underestimated their contributions to their records. Horn said later that the British music media often misunderstood the processes involved in studio recording. He said the band were \"better than people gave them credit for\", and cited \"The Power of Love\", \"Born to Run\" and \"Krisco Kisses\" as examples of their playing on \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\".\nIn 2014, the music journalist Paul Lester wrote that although Frankie Goes to Hollywood were \"arguably the last great British pop sensation\", they were rarely cited as an influence on other artists. He wrote that this was because \"it would be impossible to recreate what they did\". Morley observed that despite having released two of the most successful records of the 1980s, they had become \"slightly lost ... The fact that something was so successful yet is part of a shadowy history is ultimate proof that it was special. They were like some contorted, profound novelty band.\" However, he argued that they had changed how commercial pop music was marketed, with more artistic and \"beautiful\" packaging and music videos.\nAwards and nominations.\n!

{"id": "11231", "revid": "1277760113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11231", "title": "Factors of production", "text": "In economics, factors of production, resources, or inputs are what is used in the production process to produce output\u2014that is, goods and services. The utilised amounts of the various inputs determine the quantity of output according to the relationship called the production function. There are four \"basic\" resources or factors of production: land, labour, capital and entrepreneur (or enterprise). The factors are also frequently labeled \"producer goods or services\" to distinguish them from the goods or services purchased by consumers, which are frequently labeled \"consumer goods\".\nThere are two types of factors: \"primary\" and \"secondary\". The previously mentioned primary factors are land, labour and capital. Materials and energy are considered secondary factors in classical economics because they are obtained from land, labour, and capital. The primary factors facilitate production but neither become part of the product (as with raw materials) nor become significantly transformed by the production process (as with fuel used to power machinery). Land includes not only the site of production but also natural resources above or below the soil. Recent usage has distinguished human capital (the stock of knowledge in the labor force) from labour. Entrepreneurship is also sometimes considered a factor of production. Sometimes the overall state of technology is described as a factor of production. The number and definition of factors vary, depending on theoretical purpose, empirical emphasis, or school of economics.\nHistorical schools and factors.\nIn the interpretation of the currently dominant view and of a classical economic theory developed by neoclassical economists, the term \"factors\" did not exist until after the classical period and is not to be found in any of the literature of that time.\nDifferences are most stark when it comes to deciding which factor is the most important.\nPhysiocracy.\nPhysiocracy (from the Greek for \"government of nature\") is an economic theory developed by a group of 18th century Enlightenment French economists who believed that the wealth of nations was derived solely from the value of \"land agriculture\" or \"land development\" and that agricultural products should be highly priced.\nClassical.\nThe classical economics of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and their followers focus on physical resources in defining its factors of production and discuss the distribution of cost and value among these factors. Adam Smith and David Ricardo referred to the \"component parts of price\" as the costs of using:\nThe classical economists also employed the word \"capital\" in reference to money. Money, however, was not considered to be a factor of production in the sense of capital stock since it is not used to directly produce any good. The return to loaned money or to loaned stock was styled as interest while the return to the actual proprietor of capital stock (tools, etc.) was styled as profit. See also returns.\nMarxism.\nMarx considered the \"elementary factors of the labor-process\" or \"productive forces\" to be:\nThe \"subject of labor\" refers to natural resources and raw materials, including land. The \"instruments of labor\" are tools, in the broadest sense. They include factory buildings, infrastructure, and other human-made objects that facilitate labor's production of goods and services.\nThis view seems similar to the classical perspective described above. But unlike the classical school and many economists today, Marx made a clear distinction between labor actually done and an individual's \"labor power\" or ability to work. Labor done is often referred to nowadays as \"effort\" or \"labor services\". Labor-power might be seen as a stock which can produce a flow of labor.\nLabor, not labor power, is the key factor of production for Marx and the basis for earlier economists' labor theory of value. The hiring of labor power only results in the production of goods or services (\"use-values\") when organized and regulated (often by the \"management\"). How much labor is actually done depends on the importance of conflict or tensions within the labor process.\nNeoclassical economics.\nNeoclassical economics, one of the branches of mainstream economics, started with the classical factors of production of land, labor, and capital. However, it developed an alternative theory of value and distribution. Many of its practitioners have added various further factors of production (see below).\nFurther distinctions from classical and neoclassical microeconomics include the following:\nEcological economics.\nEcological economics is an alternative to neoclassical economics. It integrates, among other things, the first and second laws of thermodynamics (see: Laws of thermodynamics) to formulate more realistic economic systems that adhere to fundamental physical limitations. In addition to the neoclassical focus on efficient allocation, ecological economics emphasizes sustainability of scale and just distribution. Ecological economics also differ from neoclassical theories in its definitions of factors of production, replacing them with the following:\nIntegral to ecological economics is the following notion: at the maximum rates of sustainable matter and energy uptake, the only way to increase productivity would be through an increase in design intelligence. This provides the basis for a core tenet of ecological economics, namely that infinite growth is impossible.\nFourth factor.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, some authors added the work of organization or entrepreneurship as a fourth factor of production. This became standard in the post-war Neoclassical synthesis. For example, J. B. Clark saw the co-ordinating function in production and distribution as being served by entrepreneurs; Frank Knight introduced managers who co-ordinate using their own money (financial capital) and the financial capital of others. In contrast, many economists today consider \"human capital\" (skills and education) as the fourth factor of production, with entrepreneurship as a form of human capital. Yet others refer to intellectual capital. More recently, many have begun to see \"social capital\" as a factor, as contributing to production of goods and services.\nEntrepreneurship.\nIn markets, entrepreneurs combine the other factors of production, land, labor, and capital, to make a profit. Often these entrepreneurs are seen as innovators, developing new ways to produce new products. In a planned economy, central planners decide how land, labor, and capital should be used to provide for maximum benefit for all citizens. Just as with market entrepreneurs, the benefits may mostly accrue to the entrepreneurs themselves.\nThe sociologist C. Wright Mills refers to \"new entrepreneurs\" who work within and between corporate and government bureaucracies in new and different ways. Others (such as those practicing public choice theory) refer to \"political entrepreneurs\", i.e., politicians and other actors.\nMuch controversy rages about the benefits produced by entrepreneurship. But the real issue is about how well institutions they operate in (markets, planning, bureaucracies, government) serve the public. This concerns such issues as the relative importance of market failure and government failure.\nIn the book \"Accounting of Ideas\", \"intequity\", a neologism, is abstracted from equity to add a newly researched production factor of the capitalist system. Equity, which is regarded as part of capital, was divided into equity and intequity. Intequity means capital of ideas. Entrepreneurship was divided into network-related matters and creating-related matters. Network-related matters function in the sphere of equity, and creating-related matters in spheres of intequities.\nNatural resources.\nAyres and Warr (2010) are among the economists who criticize orthodox economics for overlooking the role of natural resources and the effects of declining resource capital. See also: \"Natural resource economics\"\nEnergy.\nReiner K\u00fcmmel worked on the evaluation of energy, or more precisely exergy, as a production factor. He showed it can be seen as individual factor of production, with an elasticity larger than labor. A cointegration analysis support results derived from linear exponential (LINEX) production functions. The work of Ayres shows similar results.\nCultural heritage.\nC. H. Douglas disagreed with classical economists who recognized only three factors of production. While Douglas did not deny the role of these factors in production, he considered the \"Cultural heritage\" as the primary factor. He defined cultural inheritance as the knowledge, techniques, and processes that have accrued to us incrementally from the origins of civilization (i.e., progress). Consequently, mankind does not have to keep \"reinventing the wheel\". \"We are merely the administrators of that cultural inheritance, and to that extent, the cultural inheritance is the property of all of us, without exception. Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx claimed that labor creates all value. While Douglas did not deny that all costs ultimately relate to labour charges of some sort (past or present), he denied that the present labour of the world creates all wealth. Douglas carefully distinguished between value, costs and prices. He claimed that one of the factors resulting in a misdirection of thought in terms of the nature and function of money was economists' near-obsession about values and their relation to prices and incomes. While Douglas recognized \"value in use\" as a legitimate theory of values, he also considered values as subjective and not capable of being measured in an objective manner.\nPeter Kropotkin argued for the common ownership of all intellectual and useful property due to the collective work that went into creating it. Kropotkin does not argue that the product of a worker's labor should belong to the worker. Instead, Kropotkin asserts that every individual product is essentially the work of everyone since every individual relies on the intellectual and physical labor of those who came before them as well as those who built the world around them. Because of this, Kropotkin proclaims that every human deserves an essential right to well-being because every human contributes to the collective social product: Kropotkin goes on to say that the central obstacle preventing humanity from claiming this right is the state's violent protection of private property. Kropotkin compares this relationship to feudalism, saying that even if the forms have changed, the essential relationship between the propertied and the landless is the same as the relationship between a feudal lord and their serfs."}

Located in northeastern Indiana, the city is west of the Ohio border and south of the Michigan border. The city's population was 263,886 as of the 2020 census, making it the second-most populous city in Indiana after Indianapolis, and the 83rd-most populous city in the United States. It is the principal city of the Fort Wayne metropolitan area, consisting of Allen and Whitley counties which had an estimated population of 423,038 as of 2021. Fort Wayne is the cultural and economic center of northeastern Indiana.\nFort Wayne was built in 1794 by the United States Army under the direction of American Revolutionary War general Anthony Wayne, the last in a series of forts built near the Miami village of Kekionga. Named in Wayne's honor, the European-American settlement developed at the confluence of the St. Joseph, St. Marys, and Maumee rivers, known originally as Fort Miami, a trading post constructed by Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes around 1706. The modern city was platted in 1823 following its revitalization after the War of 1812 and its siege. It underwent tremendous growth after completion of the Wabash and Erie Canal and advent of the railroad.\nOnce a booming manufacturing town located in what became known as the Rust Belt, Fort Wayne's economy in the 21st century is based upon distribution, transportation and logistics; healthcare, professional and business services; leisure and hospitality, and financial services. Home to the Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base, the city is a center for the defense industry, which employs 1\u20132% of the population. Fort Wayne was an All-America City Award recipient in 1983, 1998, 2009, and 2021. The city also received an Outstanding Achievement City Livability Award by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 1999.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nOriginal settlement and French control (1706-1760).\nThis area here on the river confluence was occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples for as long as 10,000 years. The Miami tribe would eventually establish its settlement of Kekionga at this confluence of the Maumee, St. Joseph, and St. Marys rivers in the late stages of the Beaver Wars in the 1690s. It was the capital of the Miami nation and related Algonquian tribes.\nIn 1696, Comte de Frontenac appointed Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, who began visiting Kekionga in 1702, and would later build the original Fort Miami here in the wilderness and pays d'en Haut of New France around 1706; Initially, a small trading outpost. It was part of a group of forts and trading posts built between Quebec and St. Louis. The first census in 1744 recorded a population of approximately 40 Frenchmen and 1,000 Miamians.\nFrom the British back to the Miami (1760-1776).\nIncreasing tension between France and Great Britain developed over control of the territory. In 1760, France ceded the area to Britain after its forces in North America surrendered during the Seven Years' War, known on the North American front as the French and Indian War. Managing to hold down the fort for only a mere couple of years, the British lost control of it in 1763 when various Native American nations rebelled against British rule and retook the fort as part of Pontiac's Rebellion. From this point forward in 1763, no active fort existed at Kekionga for the next three decades until American General Anthony Wayne established Fort Wayne in 1794, following the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The fort throughout this period was described as a, \"Defiant mixture of Indian warriors and lawless renegades of the frontier, such as the Girties. It was also the home of a heterogeneous population of English and French traders and their families, French 'engages\", and Miami, Delaware and Shawnee tribes.\"\nIn 1772, the British regained influence over the village after Sir William Johnson suggested to the government that the fort be reoccupied. The mixed population of the Kekionga area had moved past antipathy with the British by this point, and accepted their friendship. In 1776, Officer Jacques LaSalle moved into the village to conduct strict supervision on behalf of the British government, ensuring that the natives remained loyal to the British, and to check passports with travelers coming down from Fort Detroit.\nAmerican Revolution to the Old Northwest.\nThe British continued to monitor Kekionga and Fort Miami throughout the American Revolutionary War. In 1780, French Canadian soldiers coming to assist the U.S. with the revolution were slaughtered in several nearby locations in what is known as La Balme's Defeat. At the end of the Revolutionary War, in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Britain ceded this area to the new United States, though they continued to maintain an influence on trading activity and the forts of Miami, with the primary objective of slowing American expansion into the Great Lakes region. The young United States formally organized the region in the Land Ordinance of 1785 and negotiated treaties allowing settlement, but the Western Confederacy of Native American nations were not party to these treaties and did not cede their ownership of those lands.\nAmerican land speculators and pioneers began flooding down the Ohio River into the area, leading to conflict with an alliance of native tribes known as the Western Confederacy. It was headquartered at Kekionga, where the Miami had permitted two refugee tribes dislodged by white homesteaders, the Delaware and the Shawnee, to resettle. The confederacy\u2014which included other Great Lakes and Algonquin tribes as well\u2014began sending war parties to raid settlers, hoping to drive them back across the Appalachian Mountains, and refused to meet for negotiations over a possible treaty to instead cede land for white settlement. The growing violence led to the Northwest Indian War.\nIn 1790, President George Washington ordered the U.S. Army to subdue and pacify the tribes. The first expedition, led by General Josiah Harmar reached Kekionga and exercised scorched earth tactics on the village and crops. Miami war chief Little Turtle, who had been long tracking the whereabouts of Harmar though the aid of various agents such as Simon Girty, would quickly drive Harmar and the US troops away. The confederacy warriors attacked the second invading force, led in 1791 by General Arthur St. Clair, before it could get that far and wiped it out, in a massacre known as St. Clair's Defeat at modern-day Fort Recovery, Ohio. It's known as the greatest defeat of the U.S. Army by Native Americans in history. This defeat left the US army crippled and borders open to attacks from the British and allied native tribes. General Anthony Wayne was recalled from civilian life to lead a third expedition, defeating the confederacy's warriors at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, near modern-day Toledo, Ohio on August 20, 1794. Wayne's men then marched up the Maumee River, systematically burning evacuated native towns, crops, and winter food stores, until they reached its headwaters, where Kekionga remained in ruins. Wayne then confronted the British at Fort Miami, where the British debated an attack. Later, Wayne selected the site for construction of Fort Wayne, he ordered a fort that could withstand heavy British artillery, especially a 24-pound cannon, along with attacks from their army or native allies.\nThe following year, Wayne negotiated a peace accord, the Treaty of Greenville with tribal leaders, in which they agreed to stop fighting, end support of the British, and ceded most of what is now Ohio along with certain tracts further west, including the area around Fort Wayne encompassing Kekionga and the land portage. Wayne promised the remainder would remain Indian lands, which is why the territory west of Ohio was named Indiana. Wayne would die one year later and a Spanish spy James Wilkinson would assume his role as General. In subsequent years, the government used Fort Wayne to hand out annual payments under the treaty. But in a recurring cycle, the tribes ran up debts to white traders who came there to sell them alcohol and manufactured goods, and the government pushed tribal leaders\u2014including through bribes\u2014to sell more reservation land to pay off those debts and, when the land was gone, then to agree to have the tribe removed to the Far West.\nIn 1802, a United States fur trade factory was established in Fort Wayne. It was burned by the local Indians at the beginning of the War of 1812.\nSettlement permitted by Treaty of St. Mary's.\nThe first settlement started in 1815. In 1819, the military garrison abandoned the fort and moved to Detroit. In 1822, a federal land office opened to sell land ceded by local Native Americans by the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1818. Platted in 1823 at the Ewing Tavern, the village became an important frontier outpost and was incorporated as the Town of Fort Wayne in 1829, with a population of 300. The Wabash and Erie Canal's opening improved travel conditions to the Great Lakes and Mississippi River, exposing Fort Wayne to expanded economic opportunities. The population topped 2,000 when the town was incorporated as the City of Fort Wayne on February 22, 1840.\nPioneer newspaperman George W. Wood was elected the city's first mayor. Fort Wayne's \"Summit City\" nickname dates from this period, referring to the city's position at the highest elevation along the canal's route. As influential as the canal was to the city's earliest development, it quickly became obsolete after briefly competing with the city's first railroad, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, completed in 1854.\nModern history.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the population of Fort Wayne nearly reached 50,000, attributed to a large influx of German and Irish immigrants. Fort Wayne's \"urban working class\" thrived in industrial and railroad-related jobs. The city's economy was substantially based on manufacturing, ushering in an era of innovation with several notable inventions and developments coming out of the city over the years, such as gasoline pumps (1885), the refrigerator (1913), and in 1972, the first home video game console. The Great Flood of 1913 caused seven deaths, left 15,000 homeless, and damaged over 5,500 buildings in the worst natural disaster in the city's history.\nAs the automobile's prevalence grew, Fort Wayne became a fixture on the Lincoln Highway. Aviation arrived in 1919 with the opening of the city's first airport, Smith Field. The airport served as Fort Wayne's primary commercial airfield until Baer Field (now Fort Wayne International Airport) was transferred to the city in 1947 after serving as a military base during World War II.\nFort Wayne was hit by the Great Depression beginning in 1929, with most factories cutting their workforce. The stock market crash did not discourage plans to build the city's first skyscraper and Indiana's tallest building at the time, the Lincoln Bank Tower. By 1935, the New Deal's WPA put over 7,000 residents back to work through local infrastructure improvements, including the construction of new parks, bridges, viaducts, and a $5.2 million sewage treatment facility.\nThe helped the city prosper once again. Between 1950 and 1955, more than 5,000 homes were built, many in large subdivisions in rural Allen County. In 1950, Fort Wayne's first bypass, Coliseum Boulevard, opened on the north side of the city, followed by the city's first arena, War Memorial Coliseum, bringing new opportunities for suburban expansion. The Coliseum was home to the NBA's from 1952 to 1957. The opening of enclosed shopping malls and the construction of Interstate 69 through rural areas north and west of the city proper further drove the exodus of retail from downtown through the 1960s. According to the Fort Wayne Home Builders Association estimates, more than 80 percent of new home construction occurred outside the city proper in the 1970s.\nLike many cities in the Rust Belt, deindustrialization in the 1980s brought urban blight, increased crime, and a decrease in blue-collar manufacturing jobs. Downtown and surrounding neighborhoods continued declining as residents and businesses sprawled further into rural Allen County. A 1982 flood forced an evacuation of 9,000 residents, damaging 2,000 buildings, and costing $56.1 million (1982 USD, $137 million 2015 USD), prompting a visit from then president of the United States, Ronald Reagan.\nIn the 1990s, the city began a turnaround. Local leaders focused on crime reduction, economic diversification, and downtown redevelopment. By 1999, Fort Wayne's crime rate decreased to the lowest levels since 1974, and the city's economy recovered, with the unemployment rate hovering at 2.4 percent in 1998. Clearing blighted buildings downtown resulted in new public greenspaces, including Headwaters Park, which has become the premier community gathering space and centerpiece in the city's $50 million flood control project. Fort Wayne celebrated its bicentennial in 1994.\nThe city continued to concentrate on downtown redevelopment and investment in the 2000s. The decade saw the beginnings of its transformation, with renovations and expansions of the Allen County Public Library, Grand Wayne Convention Center, and Fort Wayne Museum of Art. In 2007, the $130 million Harrison Square development was launched, creating Parkview Field. Suburban growth continued, with the opening of Fort Wayne's first lifestyle center, Jefferson Pointe, and the half-billion dollar Parkview Regional Medical Center in 2012.\nGeography.\nFort Wayne is in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States, in northeastern Indiana, west of Ohio and south of Michigan. According to the 2010 census, Fort Wayne has a total area of , of which (or 99.81%) is land and (or 0.19%) is water.\nTopography.\nFor a regional summit, the city is situated on flat land characterized by little topographical relief, a result of the Wisconsin glaciation episode. Receding glaciers eroded the land, depositing an evenly distributed layer of sediment during the last glacial period. The most distinguishable topographical feature is Cedar Creek Canyon, just north of the city proper near Huntertown. The Fort Wayne Moraine follows two of the city's three rivers: the St. Marys and St. Joseph. The two rivers converge to form the Maumee, which eventually empties into Lake Erie. Land east of the moraine includes the former Great Black Swamp, a lacustrine plain formed by Glacial Lake Maumee. The Little River flows southwest of Fort Wayne, a tributary of the Wabash River, and remnant of the Maumee Torrent.\nFort Wayne is situated on the Saint Lawrence River Divide, a continental divide separating the Great Lakes Basin from the Gulf of Mexico watershed.\nThe most important geographical feature of the area is the short distance over land between the Three Rivers system, which eventually flows to the Atlantic, and the Wabash system, which eventually flows to the Gulf of Mexico. This came to be the \"portage\" or carrying place, over which travelers could transport their cargoes from one system to the next. This natural crossroads attracted the Native Americans for thousands of years. It later attracted the European explorers and traders and the American pioneer settlers who continued to develop the area as a transportation and communications center. Chief Little Turtle of the Miami Nation expressed its importance eloquently at the treaty of Greenville in 1795 when he called it \"that glorious gate...through which all the words of our chiefs had to pass through from north to south and from east to west\".\nFort Wayne's urban tree canopy is 29 percent, double the state average of 14.5 percent and above the national average of 27.1 percent. The canopy is decreasing, notably from development and the emerald ash borer infestation. Fort Wayne has been designated a Tree City USA since 1990.\nCityscape.\nHistorically, Fort Wayne has been divided into four unofficial quadrants: northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. Calhoun Street divides the southwest and southeast, while the St. Joseph River divides the northwest and northeast quadrants. The Maumee River separates the northeast and southeast, while portions of the St. Marys River and Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad separate the northwest and southwest quadrants.\nFort Wayne's early 20th century development was influenced by the City Beautiful movement and centered on a park and boulevard plan conceived by urban planner Charles Mulford Robinson in 1909 and finalized by landscape architect George Kessler in 1912. The master plan proposed a network of parkways and boulevards connecting the city's three rivers and Spy Run Creek to dozens of neighborhoods and parks. Several parks were designed by noted landscape architect Arthur Asahel Shurcliff. Much of the original plan was implemented by 1955. In 2010, the Fort Wayne Park and Boulevard System was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, consisting of 11 public parks, four parkways, and ten boulevards, covering .\nArchitecture.\nDuring the 19th century, Fort Wayne was dominated by Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, and Italianate architecture. Examples of Greek Revival architecture remain in the city, with one being the Richardville House (1827), a National Historic Landmark. Gothic and Gothic Revival architecture can be found in some of the city's most prominent churches, including Trinity English Lutheran Church (1846), Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (1860), Trinity Episcopal Church (1865), and Saint Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church (1889).\nPopular early 20th century architectural styles found in the city include Queen Anne, Richardsonian Romanesque, Neoclassical, Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, Prairie, American Craftsman, American Foursquare, and Art Deco. Richardsonian Romanesque buildings include Fort Wayne City Hall (1893) and John H. Bass Mansion (1902), each designed by Wing &amp; Mahurin. Notable examples of Neoclassical architecture include the Masonic Temple (1926) and North Side High School (1927). Beaux-Arts, an architectural style closely related to Neoclassical, gained popularity during the City Beautiful movement of the 1890s and early 1900s, which is reflected in the Allen County Courthouse (1902).\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad Station, also known as Baker Street Station (1914), was designed in American Craftsman style. At , the Art Deco-style Lincoln Bank Tower was Fort Wayne's first high-rise and Indiana's tallest building from 1930 to 1962. The E. Ross Adair Federal Building and United States Courthouse (1932) is another example of Art Deco architecture. Williams\u2013Woodland Park Historic District includes examples of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival residential homes, while the Forest Park Boulevard Historic District includes Tudor Revival homes.\nModern and Postmodern architecture can be found in buildings constructed during the second half of the 20th century in Fort Wayne. The John D. Haynes House (1952) was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, while the campus of Concordia Theological Seminary (1953) was designed by Eero Saarinen. Postmodern architect Michael Graves' first commissions were built in the city, including Hanselmann House (1967) and Snyderman House (1972, now demolished). Louis Kahn's design for the Arts United Center (1973) was inspired by a violin and its case. Other notable buildings include Indiana Michigan Power Center (1982), the tallest building in the city and tallest building in Indiana outside of Indianapolis, at .\nThe 1970s characterized an era in Fort Wayne that saw substantial changes to the downtown area in accommodation of increasing suburbanization and urban sprawl that began in the city during the early 1950s, of which resulted in the demolition of several prominent and historical buildings and homes around the downtown area. This included several hotels, such as the historic thirteen-floor Hotel Anthony. Most of which, were demolished for surface-level parking lots. One example was the Ewing Homestead, built by William Ewing in 1838, it once stood at the northwest corner of Berry Street:This three-story brick mansion was one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in Fort Wayne until it was destroyed in 1970 to make way for a parking lot.\nRivers.\nSince at least the early 20th century, Fort Wayne has maintained a combined sewage overflow program, which has resulted in the city routinely discharging untreated human waste, raw sewage from businesses and homes, toxic waste from industrial sites, and agricultural runoff into all three rivers in a number of locations, particularly during heavy rainfall events. However, as of 2023, a several million dollar citywide sewage overflow tunnel project is set to be completed, among additional efforts, such as a $135 million investment from the city into rain gardens, to prevent further discharge into the rivers. There has been growing investment and development along the riverfront since at least 2019.\nClimate.\nFort Wayne lies in the humid continental climate zone (K\u00f6ppen: \"Dfa\"), experiencing four distinct seasons. The city is located in USDA hardiness zones 5b and 6a. Typically, summers are hot, humid, and wet. Winters are generally cold with moderate snowfall. The average annual precipitation is , recorded at Fort Wayne International Airport. During the winter season, snowfall accumulation averages per year. Lake-effect snow is not uncommon to the region, but usually appears in the form of light snow flurries.\nThe National Weather Service reports the highest recorded temperature in the city at , most recently on June 28, 2012, and the lowest recorded temperature at on January 12, 1918. The wettest month on record was June 2015, with of precipitation. The greatest 24-hour rainfall was on August 1, 1926. The snowiest month on record was January 2014, with of snowfall. The greatest calendar-day snowfall was on February 28, 1900.\nSevere weather.\nSevere weather is not uncommon in Fort Wayne, particularly in the spring and summer months; the city experiences an average of 39 thunderstorm days and about 10 severe weather days annually.\nThe city has endured several tornadoes throughout its history. On July 19, 1950, a weak tornado formed on the city's west central side and moved northeast, striking the downtown area. On May 26, 2001, an EF1 tornado struck a shopping center on the city's northeast side, flipping cars and damaging roofs and windows on nearby residences and businesses. Three people were injured in the storm.\nThe city experienced wind gusts in the June 2012 North American derecho, knocking out power to 78,000, uprooting approximately 500 trees, and costing $2.5 million.\nDemographics.\nFort Wayne is the principal city of the Fort Wayne metropolitan area, consisting of Allen and Whitley counties in Indiana. It had an estimated population of 423,038 as of 2021. In addition to the two core counties, the greater Fort Wayne combined statistical area includes Adams, DeKalb, Huntington, Noble, Steuben, and Wells counties, with an estimated population of 649,105 in 2021.\n2010 census.\nAccording to the 2010 census, there were 253,691 people and 113,541 households. The racial makeup of the city is 73.62% White, 15.41% Black or African American, 0.37% Native American or Alaska Native, 3.3% Asian (1.4% Burmese, 0.4% Indian, 0.3% Vietnamese, 0.2% Chinese, 0.2% Filipino, 0.1% Korean, 0.1% Laotian, 0.1% Thai), 0.06% Pacific Islander, 3.72% from other races, and 3.52% from two or more races. 7.96% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race. Among the Hispanic population, 6.1% are Mexican, 0.4% Puerto Rican, and 0.3% Guatemalan. Non-Hispanic Whites were 70.3% of the population in 2010, down from 87.7% in 1970.\nThere were 101,585 households, of which 30.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 42.3% were married couples living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 38.0% were non-families. 31.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 3.09.\nThe median age in the city was 34.5 years. 26.4% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.2% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.5% were from 25 to 44; 24.9% were from 45 to 64; and 12% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.4% male and 51.6% female.\nFort Wayne has one of the largest Burmese American population in the U.S., estimated at 8,000. Burmese refugee settlement and \"secondary migrants\" doubled the city's Asian population between 2000 and 2010.\nReligion.\nFort Wayne is sometimes referred to as the \"City of Churches\", an unofficial moniker dating to the late-19th century when the city was the regional hub of Catholic, Lutheran, and Episcopal faiths. Today, there are 360 churches in the city. 54 percent of Fort Wayne residents identify as religious, where 16 percent are Catholic, 9 percent are Lutheran, 6.5 percent are Baptist, 5 percent are Methodist, and 16.5 percent adhere to other Christian faiths. 0.14 percent of residents are Jewish. Increasing religious minorities are found among the city's immigrant communities, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam.\nMajor churches include the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Saint Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church and Trinity Episcopal Church. Fort Wayne's Reform Judaism population is served by Congregation Achduth Vesholom, the oldest Jewish congregation in Indiana, founded in 1848. In 2013, construction began on the first Burmese Muslim mosque to be built worldwide since the mid-1970s.\nAs of December 2012, four national Christian denominations were headquartered in the city: the American Association of Lutheran Churches, the Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association, the Missionary Church and the Fellowship of Evangelical Churches. Fort Wayne is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne\u2013South Bend, covering 14 counties in Northern Indiana, and the Indiana District of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod, encompassing all of Indiana and north central Kentucky.\nEconomy.\nIn 2017, the Fort Wayne metropolitan area had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $25.7 billion. The top four industries were manufacturing ($8.1B), health care ($2.54B), retail trade ($1.4B), and finance and insurance ($1.3B). Government, if it had been a private industry, would have tied for third, generating $1.4 billion.\nManufacturing is deeply rooted in Fort Wayne's economic history, dating to the earliest days of the city's growth as an important trade stop along the Wabash and Erie Canal. Railroads, introduced shortly after the canal's arrival, eased travel from Fort Wayne to other booming industrial centers along the Great Lakes, such as Chicago, Detroit, Toledo, and Cleveland. Throughout the early and mid-20th century, manufacturing dominated the city's economic landscape. From 1900 to 1930, Fort Wayne's industrial output expanded by 747 percent, with total production valued at $95 million in 1929, up from $11 million in 1899. The total workforce also increased from 18,000 in 1900 to nearly 50,000 in 1930.\nCompanies that had a significant presence in the city include Dana Holding Corporation, Falstaff Brewing Corporation, Fruehauf Corporation, General Electric, International Harvester, Magnavox, Old Crown Brewing Corporation, and Tokheim, among several others, producing goods such as refrigerators, washing machines, automatic phonographs, meat packing products, televisions, garbage disposals, automotive parts and motors, trailers, gasoline pumps, trucks, beer, tents and awnings. Magnet wire was an especially important export for the city. In 1960, Fort Wayne companies supplied nearly 90 percent of North America's magnet wire market.\nThe 1970s and 1980s were times of economic depression in Fort Wayne, when much of the city's manufacturing foundation eroded and the blue-collar workforce shrank. Fort Wayne joined several other cities reeling economically within the Rust Belt. At the same time, General Electric also downsized much of its more than 10,000-person workforce. Amid other area plant closures and downsizing, coupled with the early 1980s recession, the city lost 30,000 jobs and reached a 12.1 percent unemployment rate. The arrival of General Motors in 1987 helped fill the void from shuttered manufacturers and aided in the area's recovery, employing 3,000 at its Fort Wayne Assembly. In 2024, General Motors was the largest manufacturer in the city, employing 4,320. The plant assembles GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado regular and double cab light- and heavy-duty pickup trucks.\nThrough the 1990s and into the 2000s, the city diversified its economy; manufacturing now employs 16.9 percent of Allen County's workforce. Other sectors include distribution, transportation, and logistics (23.1 percent), health care (17.9 percent), professional and business services (12.1 percent), leisure and hospitality (11.1 percent), and financial services (6.3 percent). The leisure and hospitality sector has especially grown, with 5.8 million visitors spending $545 million in 2013, a 4.3 percent increase over the previous year. The city is a center for the defense industry, employing thousands at such companies as BAE Systems (1,150), L3Harris (888), Raytheon Technologies (950), and the Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base (423).\nDespite economic diversification, the city was significantly impacted by the Great Recession. According to a report from Pew Research Center, the city lost nearly a quarter of its manufacturing jobs and 11% of its economic status between 2000 and 2014. Economic Innovation Group's 2016 Distressed Communities Index Report ranked Fort Wayne among the most unequal large cities in the U.S. in terms of linking economic opportunities to its distressed ZIP codes. , Allen County's labor force was 180,637 with an unemployment rate of 2.5 percent.\nCompanies based in Fort Wayne include Brotherhood Mutual, Do it Best, Franklin Electric, Genteq, Global Van Lines, Home Reserve, Indiana Michigan Power, K&amp;K Insurance, MedPro Group, North American Van Lines, Rea Magnet Wire, Steel Dynamics, Sweetwater Sound, and Vera Bradley. Steel Dynamics is the only \"Fortune\" 500 company headquartered in the city. Other prominent non-government employers include Parkview Health, Amazon, Lutheran Health Network, Lincoln Financial Group, and BFGoodrich.\nIn 2024, Google announced plans to build a data center in Fort Wayne.\nCulture.\nPerforming arts.\nThe Embassy Theatre is a 2,471-seat performing arts theater, which hosts over 200,000 patrons annually.

Foellinger Theatre, a 2,500-seat amphitheater in Franke Park, hosts seasonal acts and outdoor concerts during warmer months. Located west of downtown, Arena Dinner Theatre is a nonprofit community arts corporation with a focus on live theater production, annually hosting seven full-length theatrical productions.\nAttractions.\nThe Fort Wayne Children's Zoo has been lauded as one of the nation's foremost zoos. Covering and containing 1,000 animals of 200 different species, the zoo is the largest regional attraction, regularly drawing over 500,000 visitors annually. The Foellinger-Freimann Botanical Conservatory gardens cover , displaying over 1,200 plants of 502 different species and 72 types of cacti. Science Central, an interactive science center, contains permanent displays and temporary exhibits, drawing 130,000 visitors annually.\nEstablished in 1921, the Fort Wayne Museum of Art (FWMoA) is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, specializing in the collection and exhibition of American art. The FWMoA annually receives 100,000 visitors.\nThe History Center, located in Fort Wayne's Old City Hall, manages a collection of more than 23,000 artifacts recalling the region's history. The center is overseen by the Allen County\u2013Fort Wayne Historical Society, which maintains the Richardville House, one of two National Historic Landmarks in the city. Historic Fort Wayne, a replica of the 1815 fortification, hosts scheduled tours and historical reenactments throughout the year. Other cultural museums include the African/African\u2013American Historical Museum, Fort Wayne Firefighters Museum, Greater Fort Wayne Aviation Museum, and Baer Field Heritage Air Park.\nThe Allen County Public Library's Fred J. Reynolds Historical Genealogy Department is the second-largest genealogy collection in North America. The collection contains 350,000 printed volumes and 513,000 items of microfilm and microfiche.\nFestivals and events.\nThe city hosts a variety of cultural festivals and events annually. Festivals commemorating ethnic food, dance, music, and art include Germanfest, Greek Festival, and Japanese Cherry Blossom Festival. Initiated in 1997, Fort Wayne Pride celebrates northeast Indiana's LGBTQ community. BBQ RibFest showcases barbecue rib cooks and live entertainment, attracting 40,000 visitors annually.\nFort4Fitness is a certified half marathon, run/walk, and health fair. Over 9,000 participated in the 2011 half marathon. In 2012, Fort4Fitness debuted a spring cycle, Bike-the-Fort, which included three bicycling tours with over 1,000 participants. HolidayFest begins with the Night of Lights on Thanksgiving eve, with the lighting of the PNC Santa and Reindeer, Wells Fargo Holiday Display, and Indiana Michigan Power Christmas Wreath, ending with a fireworks finale at Parkview Field.\nThe largest annual events in the city are the Johnny Appleseed Festival, Taste of the Arts, Middlewaves and the Three Rivers Festival. The Johnny Appleseed Festival draws 300,000 visitors. The festival is held at Johnny Appleseed Park, where American folklore legend John Chapman is believed to be buried. Apple-themed cuisine, crafts, and historical demonstrations recalling 19th century American pioneering are among some of the festival's events. Three Rivers Festival, a celebration of Fort Wayne, spans nine days each July, attracting 400,000 visitors. Three Rivers features over 200 events, including a parade, midway, hot dog eating contest, bed race, raft race, arts fair, and fireworks spectacular. Other annual events include the Allen County Fair, BAALS Music Festival, National Soccer Festival, and the Vera Bradley Outlet Sale.\nSports.\nFort Wayne is home to two minor league professional sports franchises: the Fort Wayne Komets of the ECHL and the Fort Wayne TinCaps of the High-A Central. Other teams based in the city include Fort Wayne FC, a pre-professional soccer club which competes in the USL2, and the Fort Wayne Derby Girls of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association Division 2. Fort Wayne's primary sports venues include the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum and Parkview Field.\nThe city has been home to other professional sports franchises, including the National Basketball Association's Fort Wayne Pistons (which moved to Detroit in 1957), the Fort Wayne Daisies of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, and the Fort Wayne Kekiongas of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (precursor to Major League Baseball).\nIntercollegiate sports in the city include the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons, representing Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW) in the NCAA's Division I Horizon League, and NAIA schools Indiana Tech (Wolverine\u2013Hoosier Athletic Conference) and University of Saint Francis (Crossroads League and Mid-States Football Association). The Mastodons had represented Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) prior to its 2018 split into two separate institutions (see below), and from 2016 to 2018 were branded as the Fort Wayne Mastodons, but the athletic brand was changed to \"Purdue Fort Wayne\" shortly before the split took effect.\nSome notable events in sports history occurred in Fort Wayne. On June 2, 1883, Fort Wayne hosted the Quincy Professionals for one of the first lighted evening baseball games ever recorded. Fort Wayne is also credited as the birthplace of the NBA, as Pistons' coach Carl Bennett brokered the merger of the BAA and the NBL in 1948 from his Alexander Street home. On March 10, 1961, Wilt Chamberlain became the first player in the NBA to reach 3,000 points in a single season while competing at the War Memorial Coliseum.\nParks and recreation.\nFort Wayne Parks and Recreation maintains 86 public parks totaling . Three public and 20 private golf courses are located in Allen County. Several notable parks include Johnny Appleseed Park (home to a campground and John Chapman's grave), McCulloch Park (home to Samuel Bigger's grave), and the Old Fort Park (The first and oldest park in Fort Wayne, site of the original well used in this fort). Downtown, there are a number of parks including Foellinger-Freimann Botanical Conservatory, Headwaters Park, Promenade Park, Swinney Park, and Lawton Park (named for Major-General Henry Lawton), which includes a skate park. Franke Park is the most extensive city park, covering . Franke is home to the Foellinger Theatre, Shoaff Lake, and the Fort Wayne Children's Zoo.\nStarting in the 1970s, the city developed a system of recreational trails along the riverbanks, known as the Rivergreenway, with the aim of beautifying the riverfronts and promoting active lifestyles for residents. The Rivergreenway was designated a National Recreation Trail in 2009. As of 2018, the Rivergreenway had expanded with additional trails to encompass nearly throughout the city and county, with about 550,000 annual users. With the expansion of trails in recent years, cycling has become an emerging mode of transportation for residents. In 2009, the city's first bicycle lanes were established with the installation of 250 bike parking places. In 2016, Fort Wayne was designated a Bronze Level bicycle friendly community by the League of American Bicyclists.\nHurshtown Reservoir, near Grabill, is the largest body of water in Allen County and is popular with watersports enthusiasts for sailing and fishing. Some 300 lakes are located within of the city. Located downtown along the St. Marys River, Fort Wayne Outfitters offers canoe, kayak, stand-up paddle board, and pontoon boat rentals for recreation along the three rivers.\nAccording to the Trust for Public Land's 2017 ParkScore Index, some 56% of Fort Wayne residents are underserved.\nGovernment.\nFort Wayne has a mayor\u2013council government. The mayor, city clerk, and city council members serve four-year terms. Citizens Square houses the executive and legislative branches of city government. As the county seat of Allen County, Fort Wayne serves as the administrative center for county-level elected offices and government functions.\nFort Wayne's current mayor is Sharon Tucker, a Democrat. Tucker \u2013 a former county and city councilwoman \u2013 succeeded Tom Henry, a record four-term mayor who died from stomach cancer in March 2024. On April 20, 2024, Tucker won a county party caucus to finish Henry's term, making her the city's first Black mayor. Fort Wayne City Council has nine elected members, one representative from each of the city's six council districts and three at-large members, serving four-year terms.\nThe city is represented in the Indiana General Assembly by three Senate Districts and seven House Districts. Fort Wayne's state senators include Dennis Kruse (14th District), Liz Brown (15th), and David Long (16th). Representatives include Dan Leonard (50th District), Ben Smaltz (52nd), Phil GiaQuinta (80th), Martin Carbaugh (81st), Christopher Judy (83rd), Bob Morris (84th), and Dave Heine (85th). Federally, Fort Wayne is part of Indiana's 3rd congressional district, represented by Republican Jim Banks, who was first elected in 2016.\nUnder the Unigov provision of Indiana Law, Fort Wayne would have automatically consolidated with Allen County when its population exceeded 250,000, previously the minimum population for a first class city in Indiana. Fort Wayne nearly met the state requirements for first class city designation on January 1, 2006, when of neighboring Aboite Township (and a small section of Wayne Township) including 25,094 people were annexed. However, a 2004 legislative change raised the population threshold for first-class status from 250,000 to 600,000, which ensured Indianapolis' status as the only first class city in Indiana.\nFort Wayne's E. Ross Adair Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse houses the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, which was authorized by Congress in 1928.\nPublic safety.\nMunicipal and state laws are enforced by the Fort Wayne Police Department, an organization of 460 officers. In 2006, Fort Wayne's crime rate was 5104.1 per 100,000 people, slightly above the national average of 4479.3. There were 18 murders, 404 robberies, and 2,128 burglaries in 2006. Steve Reed was appointed to the position of police chief in 2016. In 2014, former police chief Rusty York was appointed to the position of director of public safety. York previously served as police chief from 2000 to 2014.\nThe city is currently served by the Allen County Jail in downtown Fort Wayne, controlled by the Allen County Sheriff's department. In January 2020, a class action lawsuit was filed by Vincent Morris, an inmate at the jail, and the ACLU of Indiana against the Sheriff of Allen County. The lawsuit alleges understaffing of the jail, as well as overpopulation, among other complaints resulting in dangerous housing conditions. In March 2022, Judge Damon Leichty of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana ruled that conditions in the jail were in violation of the 8th Amendment and 14th Amendment. In his injunction, Judge Leichty ruled that there needed to be substantial progress in the construction of a new jail with expanding capacity. Since this injunction there have been 8 proposed sites for the new jail to be constructed, with the most prominent being at the Allen County Sheriffs department training facility land off of Paulding and Adams Center Roads, which the county already owns. However, this location is being heavily contested for being on the Southeast side of Fort Wayne, as another negative for an already disadvantaged area. At its current location, the jail also sits on what is very valuable land given the city's recent riverfront development, right in between some hallmark developments for the revitalization of the downtown area.\nAs of 2010, the Fort Wayne Fire Department included 375 uniformed firefighters and 18 fire stations. Eric Lahey was appointed fire chief in 2014.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nFour K\u201312 public school districts serve portions of the city. Fort Wayne Community Schools (FWCS) is the largest public school district in Indiana, enrolling nearly 31,000 students in the 2013\u20132014 academic year. FWCS operate 51 facilities, including 31 elementary schools, ten middle schools, and five high schools. The student body is diverse, with 75 spoken languages in the district. East Allen County Schools (EACS) operate 14 schools, with a total enrollment of 10,010. Northwest Allen County Schools (NACS) operate seven elementary schools, two middle schools, and one high school, with a total enrollment of 6,853. Southwest Allen County Schools (SACS) operate six elementary schools, two middle schools, and one high school, with a total enrollment of 6,995. Private primary and secondary education is offered largely through Lutheran Schools of Indiana and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne\u2013South Bend. Amish Parochial Schools of Indiana oversees schooling through the eighth grade in rural eastern Allen County.\nHigher education.\nFort Wayne hosts regional campuses affiliated with both of Indiana's major state university systems. Indiana University Fort Wayne (IU Fort Wayne) and Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW) were established in 2018 following the dissolution of their predecessor institution, Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW). IPFW's degree programs in health sciences were transferred to IU Fort Wayne; as such, that institution is now home to the Fort Wayne Center for Medical Education, a branch of the Indiana University School of Medicine. All remaining IPFW degree programs were taken over by PFW. Indiana's community college system, Ivy Tech, manages two campuses and several learning sites throughout the city.\nThree private universities are based in Fort Wayne. Concordia Theological Seminary is a seminary affiliated with the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. Established in 1846, it is the oldest higher education institution in the city. Indiana Tech, founded in 1930, has a full-time enrollment of about 3,900 students. In 1890, the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration established the University of Saint Francis, later relocating the Catholic institution to Fort Wayne in 1944. In 2023, it had a full-time enrollment of about 1,700 students. Several private institutions operate branch campuses in the city, including the College of Biblical Studies, Huntington University, Indiana Wesleyan University, Manchester University, and Trine University.\nLibraries.\nFort Wayne is home to the main library and thirteen branches of the Allen County Public Library. It is among the 20 largest public library systems in the U.S., and ranks 89th factoring in academic libraries, with 3.4 million volumes. The library's foundation is also among the nation's largest, with $14 million in assets. The entire library system underwent an $84.1 million overhaul from 2002 to 2007. In 2009, over 7.4 million materials were borrowed by patrons, with over 3 million visits made throughout the library system. The Main Library in downtown Fort Wayne houses the second largest genealogical research collection in the U.S.\nMedia.\nMajor broadcasting network affiliates include WANE-TV (CBS), WPTA-TV (ABC/NBC), WISE-TV (CW), WFFT-TV (Fox), and WFWA-TV (PBS), Northeast Indiana's PBS member station. Religious broadcasters include WINM. Access Fort Wayne maintains Fort Wayne and Allen County's Public Access capabilities serving from the Allen County Public Library. One National Public Radio station is based in the city, WBOI, with the new WELT Community Radio Station transmitting from the Allen County Public Library.\nFort Wayne is served by two primary newspapers, the \"Journal Gazette\" and Pulitzer Prize-winning \"News-Sentinel\". The two dailies have separate editorial departments, but under a joint operating agreement, printing, advertising, and circulation are handled by Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc. The \"News-Sentinel\" announced that it would cease printing operations in favor of digital publishing in August 2017.\nIn the early 1970s, an alternative newspaper called the \"Fort Wayne Free Press\" was published in the city.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nFort Wayne includes two municipal airports, both managed by the Fort Wayne\u2013Allen County Airport Authority. Fort Wayne International Airport (FWA) is the city's primary commercial airport, with five airlines offering direct service to 13 domestic connections. The airport is Indiana's second busiest, with over 350,000 passenger enplanements in 2015. Fort Wayne International is also home to the 122nd Fighter Wing's Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base. Smith Field, in northern Fort Wayne, is used primarily for general aviation.\nFort Wayne is served by a single Interstate, (Interstate 69), along with an auxiliary beltway (Interstate 469). Once the State Road 37 expressway between Bloomington and Martinsville is completed in 2018, filling a gap in I-69 that exists south of Indianapolis, the road will run south to Evansville; it currently runs north to the Canada\u2013United States border at Port Huron, Michigan. In the coming years, I-69 will extend to the US\u2013Mexico border in Texas, with branches ending in Laredo, Pharr, and Brownsville. Four U.S. Routes bisect the city, including US\u00a024, US\u00a027, US\u00a030, and US\u00a033.\nFive Indiana State Roads also meet in the city, including State Road 1, State Road 3, State Road 14, State Road 37, and State Road 930. Airport Expressway, a four-lane divided highway, links Fort Wayne International Airport directly to I-69. About 85 percent of residents commute alone by personal vehicle, while another eight percent carpool.\nUnlike most cities comparable to its size, Fort Wayne does not have an urban freeway system. In 1946, planners proposed a $27 million federally funded freeway, crossing east\u2013west and north\u2013south through downtown. Opponents successfully campaigned against the proposal, objecting to the demolition of nearly 1,500 homes at the time of the post-World War II housing shortage, while playing on fears that the project would force displaced minorities into white neighborhoods. In 1947, Fort Wayne residents voted down the referendum that would have allowed for its construction, dubbed the 'Anthony Wayne Parkway.' Beginning in 1962, construction commenced for I-69 in suburban Fort Wayne.\nThe I-469 beltway around the southern and eastern fringes of Fort Wayne and New Haven was constructed between 1988 and 1995 as the largest public works project in Allen County history, at $207 million.\nAmtrak's \"Capitol Limited\" (Chicago\u2014Toledo\u2014Cleveland\u2014Pittsburgh\u2014Washington, D.C.) and Amtrak's \"Lake Shore Limited\" (Chicago\u2014Toledo\u2014Cleveland\u2014Buffalo\u2014Albany\u2014split to Boston and to New York City) are the closest passenger rail services to Fort Wayne, located north at Waterloo Station. Service by Amtrak ended in 1990 when the \"Broadway Limited\" was rerouted away from Fort Wayne's Pennsylvania Station. Until 1961 the Pennsylvania Railroad operated the north\u2013south \"Northern Arrow\" through the station. Other stations in Fort Wayne served the passenger trains of the Chicago, Indianapolis, and Louisville Railway ('Monon Railroad') and the Wabash Railroad (hosting the east\u2013west \"Wabash Cannon Ball).\"\nThere has been a movement to bring direct passenger rail service back in the form of Amtrak or high-speed rail service. In 2013, a feasibility study was published outlining the impacts of a proposed Columbus\u2014Fort Wayne\u2014Chicago high-speed rail corridor. At , the route would cost $1.29 billion and generate some $7.1 billion in economic benefits to the region. Freight service is provided by a class I railroad (Norfolk Southern) and two class III railroads. Fort Wayne is headquarters and main operations hub of Norfolk Southern's Triple Crown Services subsidiary, the largest truckload shipper in the U.S.\nCitilink operates and manages the city's public bus system, including paratransit and fixed-route service in the cities of Fort Wayne and New Haven via downtown's Central Station. CampusLink debuted in 2009 as a free shuttle service for students, faculty, and general public traveling between Ivy Tech's Coliseum and North campuses, IPFW and its student housing on the Waterfield Campus, and shopping and residential areas. MedLink debuted in 2013, connecting Parkview Regional Medical Center with Parkview Health's Randallia campus. Despite annual ridership of 2.2 million, less than one percent of residents commute by public transportation. Fort Wayne is served by two intercity bus providers: Greyhound Lines (Indianapolis\u2014Toledo\u2014Detroit) and Lakefront Lines (Chicago\u2014Columbus\u2014Akron).\nIn 2016, the city introduced its first bike-sharing program, including five stations and 25 bicycles.\nHealthcare.\nHealthcare in the Fort Wayne area is primarily provided by two nonprofit healthcare systems headquartered in the city: Parkview Health and Lutheran Health Network. Notable hospitals include Dupont Hospital, Lutheran Hospital of Indiana, Parkview Hospital Randallia, and Parkview Regional Medical Center. Over 1,600 patient beds are available throughout the city's healthcare system.\n, both healthcare systems were Fort Wayne's first and second largest employers, respectively, contributing to a total healthcare workforce in Allen County of 34,000. In 2018, Indiana University Health opened its first facility in the city with plans for future growth. VA Northern Indiana Health Care System's Fort Wayne Campus provides medical services through the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nUtilities.\nCity Utilities is the largest municipally owned water utility in Indiana, supplying residents with of water per day from the St. Joseph River via the Three Rivers Water Filtration Plant. Sanitary sewer treatment is also managed by City Utilities. The city of Fort Wayne offers full curbside recycling and solid waste collection services for residents, currently contracted through GFL Environmental. Electricity is provided by Indiana Michigan Power, a subsidiary of American Electric Power, while natural gas is supplied by Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), a subsidiary of NiSource. All tier 1 networks and several additional telecommunication service providers cover the Fort Wayne rate area.\nSister cities.\nFort Wayne has four sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International:\nFriendship city"}
{"id": "11236", "revid": "34017952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11236", "title": "Fart (word)", "text": "Fart is a word in the English language most commonly used in reference to flatulence that can be used as a noun or a verb. The immediate roots are in the Middle English words \"ferten\", \"feortan\" and \"farten\", kin of the Old High German word \"ferzan\". Cognates are found in Old Norse, Slavic and also Greek and Sanskrit. The word \"fart\" has been incorporated into the colloquial and technical speech of a number of occupations, including computing. It is often considered unsuitable in formal situations as it may be considered vulgar or offensive.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"fart\" is one of the oldest words in the English lexicon. Its Indo-European origins are confirmed by the many cognate words in some other Indo-European languages: It is cognate with Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 (perdomai), as well as the Latin \"p\u0113d\u0115re\", Sanskrit \"pardate\", Ashkun \"pidi\u1e45\", Avestan , Italian , French \"p\u00e9ter\", Russian \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c (perdet') and Polish \"\" \u00ab PIE * [break wind loudly] or * [the same, softly], all of which mean the same thing. Like most Indo-European roots in the Germanic languages, it was altered under Grimm's law, so that Indo-European \"/p/\" &gt; \"/f/\", and \"/d/\" &gt; \"/t/\", as the German cognate \"furzen\" also manifests.\nVulgarity and offensiveness.\nIn certain circles the word is considered merely a common profanity with an often humorous connotation. For example, a person may be referred to as a 'fart', or an 'old fart', not necessarily depending on the person's age. This may convey the sense that a person is boring or unduly fussy and be intended as an insult, mainly when used in the second or third person. For example, '\"he's a boring old fart!\" However the word may be used as a colloquial term of endearment or in an attempt at humorous self-deprecation (e.g., in such phrases as \"I know I'm just an old fart\" or \"you do like to fart about!\"). 'Fart' is often only used as a term of endearment when the subject is personally well known to the user.\nIn both cases though, it tends to refer to personal habits or traits that the user considers to be a negative feature of the subject, even when it is a self-reference. For example, when concerned that a person is being overly methodical they might say 'I know I'm being an old fart', potentially to forestall negative thoughts and opinions in others. When used in an attempt to be offensive, the word is still considered vulgar, but it remains a mild example of such an insult. This usage dates back to the Medieval period, where the phrase 'not worth a fart' would be applied to an item held to be worthless.\nHistorical examples.\nThe word \"fart\" in Middle English occurs in \"Sumer Is Icumen In\", where one sign of summer is \"bucke uerte\u00fe\" (the buck farts). It appears in several of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\". In \"The Miller's Tale\", Absolon has already been tricked into kissing Alison's buttocks when he is expecting to kiss her face. Her boyfriend Nicholas hangs his buttocks out of a window, hoping to trick Absolon into kissing his buttocks in turn and then farts in the face of his rival. In \"The Summoner's Tale\", the friars in the story are to receive the smell of a fart through a twelve-spoked wheel.\nIn the early modern period, the word \"fart\" was not considered especially vulgar; it even surfaced in literary works. For example, Samuel Johnson's \"A Dictionary of the English Language\", published in 1755, included the word. Johnson defined it with two poems, one by Jonathan Swift, the other by Sir John Suckling.\nBenjamin Franklin prepared an essay on the topic for the Royal Academy of Brussels in 1781 urging scientific study. In 1607, a group of Members of Parliament had written a ribald poem entitled \"The Parliament Fart\", as a symbolic protest against the conservatism of the House of Lords and the king, James I.\nModern usage.\nWhile not one of George Carlin's original seven dirty words, he noted in a later routine that the word \"fart\" ought to be added to \"the list\" of words that were not acceptable (for broadcast) in any context (which have non-offensive meanings), and described television as (then) a \"fart-free zone\". Thomas Wolfe had the phrase \"a fizzing and sulphuric fart\" cut out of his 1929 work \"Look Homeward, Angel\" by his publisher. Ernest Hemingway, who had the same publisher, accepted the principle that \"fart\" could be cut, on the grounds that words should not be used purely to shock. The hippie movement in the 1970s saw a new definition develop, with the use of \"fart\" as a personal noun, to describe a \"detestable person, or someone of small stature or limited mental capacity\", gaining wider and more open usage as a result.\nRhyming slang developed the alternative form \"raspberry tart\", later shortened to \"raspberry\", and occasionally abbreviated further to \"razz\". This was associated with the phrase \"blowing a raspberry\". The word has become more prevalent, and now features in children's literature, such as the \"Walter the Farting Dog\" series of children's books, Robert Munsch's \"Good Families Don't\" and \"The Gas We Pass\" by Shinta Cho."}
{"id": "11237", "revid": "385837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11237", "title": "FA Cup", "text": "The Football Association Challenge Cup, more commonly known as the FA Cup, is an annual knockout football competition in domestic English football. First played during the 1871\u201372 season, it is the oldest national football competition in the world. It is organised by and named after the Football Association (The FA). A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970.\nThe competition is open to all eligible clubs down to level 9 of the English football league system, with level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above. A record 763 clubs competed in 2011\u201312. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds \u2013 the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen.\nThe first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, and are contested by clubs in the National League System, levels 5 to 10 of the English football system, more commonly called \"non-League\". 32 of these teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the 20 Premier League and 24 Championship clubs, into the draw for the third round proper. In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final. As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory.\nWinners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles, most recently in 2020, and their former manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is the competition's most successful, having won seven finals with the team. Manchester United are the current holders, having defeated local rivals Manchester City 2\u20131 in the 2024 final.\nHistory.\nIn 1863, the newly founded Football Association (the FA) published the Laws of the Game of Association Football, unifying the various different rules in use before then. On 20 July 1871, in the offices of \"The Sportsman\" newspaper, the FA Secretary C. W. Alcock proposed to the FA committee that \"it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete\". The inaugural FA Cup tournament kicked off in November 1871. After thirteen games in all, Wanderers were crowned the winners in the final, on 16 March 1872. Wanderers retained the trophy the following year. The modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888\u201389 season, when qualifying rounds were introduced.\nFollowing the 1914\u201315 edition, the competition was suspended in mid air due to the First World War, and did not resume until 1919\u201320. The 1923 FA Cup Final, commonly known as the \"White Horse Final\", was the first final to be played in the newly opened Wembley Stadium (known at the time as the Empire Stadium). The 1927 final saw \"Abide with Me\" being sung for the first time at the Cup final, which has become a pre-match tradition. Due to the outbreak of World War II, the competition was not played between the 1938\u201339 and 1945\u201346 editions. Due to the wartime breaks, the competition did not celebrate its centenary year until 1980\u201381.\nAfter some confusion over the rules in its first competition, the FA decided that any drawn match would lead to a replay, with teams competing in further replays until a game was eventually won. Alvechurch and Oxford City contested the most replayed tie in the 1971\u201372 qualification, in a tie which went to 6 matches. Multiple replays were scrapped for the competition proper in 1991\u201392, and the qualifying rounds in 1997\u201398. Replays were removed altogether from the semi-final and final matches in 2000, from the quarter-finals in 2016\u201317, the fifth round in 2019\u201320 and the first round onwards from 2024 to 2025.\nRedevelopment of Wembley saw the final played outside of England for the first time, the 2001\u20132006 finals being played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The final returned to Wembley in 2007, followed by the semi-finals from 2008.\nEligibility.\nAn application window is open to clubs before entry lists, round byes and scheduling are announced in July. All clubs in the top four levels (the Premier League and the three divisions of the English Football League) are automatically eligible. Clubs from Level 5\u20139 (non-league football) are also eligible provided they play in either the FA Trophy or FA Vase competitions in the current season. All participating clubs must also have a stadium suitable for the competition and The Association may reject applications at its discretion.\nPreviously, Level 10 clubs were a prominent feature in early qualifying rounds. The gradual remodelling of the National League System to a 'perfect' 1\u20132\u20134\u20138\u201316 system, with a first phase in 2018\u201319, a final phase in 2021\u201322 (which included the promotion of 107 clubs), and played to a full quota in 2022\u201323 has resulted in a larger number of teams playing in Level 7\u20139. Consequently, for the FA Cup, entries equal the number in tiers 1\u20139 and is cut off to those below. Though still able to apply, Level 10 clubs are used as alternatives \"subject to availability\" in the event of a non/rejected applicant (with vacancies filled by Level 10 applicants with the best PPG in the previous league season).\nThe total number of entries in the FA Cup has changed as Non-League football has gradually been expanded and reorganised over time. In the 2004\u201305 season, 660 clubs entered the competition, beating the long-standing record of 656 from the 1921\u201322 season. In 2005\u201306 this increased to 674 entrants, in 2006\u201307 to 687, in 2007\u201308 to 731 clubs, in 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 to 762.&lt;ref name=\"record number of entries for 2008/9\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of entries has also varied naturally from year-to-year as new clubs form and others dissolve at unequal rates. Though most leagues in the National League System maintain the same number of teams via reprieves, inevitably entry-level divisions (typically at tier 10) have to be impacted when a club leaves the pyramid. Therefore, for example, 759 teams entered in 2010\u201311, a record 763 in 2011\u201312, 758 in 2012\u201313, 737 in 2013\u201314 and 736 in 2014\u201315. However, since 2021\u201322, The FA has cut off automatic eligibility to the 10th tier (to appear only subject to availability) and instead set the size of the draw to match the more stable number of teams in Level 1\u20139. This means that the competition may now see a standardised number of entries from one year to the next. This number is currently 732 but could rise to 748 for 2023\u201324 with plans for a new SWPL 9th tier division to share the South West with the existing Western League.\nIt is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition, although it can happen in exceptional circumstances. Manchester United did not defend their title in 1999\u20132000, as they were already in the inaugural Club World Championship. The club stated that entering both tournaments would overload their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their Champions League and Premier League titles. The club claimed that they did not want to devalue the FA Cup by fielding a weaker side. The move benefited United as they received a two-week break and won the 1999\u20132000 league title by an 18-point margin, although they did not progress past the group stage of the Club World Championship. The withdrawal from the FA Cup, however, drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament's prestige and Sir Alex Ferguson later admitted his regret regarding their handling of the situation.\nWelsh sides that play in English leagues are eligible, although since the creation of the League of Wales there are only five clubs remaining: Cardiff City (the only non-English team to win the tournament, in 1927), Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham, and Merthyr Town. In the early years other teams from Wales, Ireland and Scotland also took part in the competition, with Glasgow side Queen's Park losing the final to Blackburn Rovers in 1884 and 1885 before being barred from entering by the Scottish Football Association.\nEntries from clubs affiliated to \"offshore\" associations are also eligible subject to consideration on an annual basis, with special provisions that may apply. In the 2013\u201314 season the first Channel Island club entered the competition when Guernsey F.C. competed. The first game played in the Channel Islands \u2013 and thus the southernmost FA Cup tie played \u2013 took place on 7 August 2021 between Jersey Bulls and Horsham YMCA. A third club, F.C. Isle of Man, was also eligible to play in 2022\u201323, but in the end all Crown Dependency teams either did not appear on the entry list or later withdrew.\nCompetition format.\nOverview.\nBeginning in August, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May. A system of byes ensures clubs above level 9 enter the competition at later stages. There is no seeding, the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw. Fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only (from the 2024\u201325 campaign, prior to the first round proper). The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis. The next six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw.\nSchedule.\nAll entrants from Level 9 begin the competition in the extra preliminary round, and any Level 10 team filling in for a vacancy. Teams from Level 8 are ranked on their PPG in the previous season, except newly promoted teams automatically ranked towards the bottom and newly relegated teams ranked to the top; teams are then split between entering at either the Extra-Preliminary or preliminary round so as to ensure the right balance of fixtures throughout the competition. From there, clubs from higher levels are added in later rounds, as per the table below.\nThe months in which rounds are played are traditional, with exact dates subject to each calendar. The number of new entries, winners from previous rounds, and division of Level 8 teams in the two preliminary rounds are based on an entry list of 732 modelled on the English league system as of 2022\u201323. From 2023 to 2024, the entry list could rise to 746 in line with sixteen additional clubs at Level 9 meaning that the extra preliminary round will have 444 teams with only 50 Level 8 clubs entering at the preliminary round.\nThe qualifying rounds are regionalised to reduce the travel costs for smaller non-league sides. The first and second proper rounds were also previously split into Northern and Southern sections, but this practice was ended after the 1997\u201398 competition. \nThe final is normally held the Saturday after the Premier League season finishes in May. The only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were: 1999\u20132000, when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment; 2010\u201311 and 2012\u201313 when the FA Cup Final was played before the Premier League season had finished, to allow Wembley Stadium to be ready for the UEFA Champions League final, and in 2011\u201312 to allow England time to prepare for that summer's European Championships; 2019\u201320 when the final was delayed until August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, and the 2021-22 when the final was held a week before the end of the league. The 2025 Final is also scheduled to take place the week before the end of the league.\nDraws.\nThe draws for the Extra Preliminary, Preliminary, and first qualifying rounds used to all occur at the same time. Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round, meaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance.\nThe draw for each of the proper rounds is broadcast live on television, usually taking place at the conclusion of live coverage of one of the games of the previous round. Public interest is particularly high during the draw for the third round, which is where the top-ranked teams are added to the draw.\nTiebreaking.\nUntil 2024-25, rounds up to and including the fourth round proper, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) went to a replay, played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that replay was still tied, the winner was settled by a period of extra time, and if still necessary, a penalty shootout. Since 2016\u201317, ties have been settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties. From 2018\u201319, Fifth round ties have also been settled by extra time and penalties. Beginning with the 2024\u201325 competition, replays have been scrapped from the first round onwards. The decision to scrap replays received criticism from a number of lower-tier clubs and government officials.\nUntil 1990\u201391, further replays would be played until one team was victorious. In 1971\u201372, a fourth qualifying round game between Alvechurch and Oxford City was played six times until Alvechurch won in the fifth replay. In their 1975 campaign, Fulham played 12 games over six rounds, which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final. Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game, but from 1991\u201392 they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice for the rounds proper. This led to penalty shoot-outs being introduced, the first of which came on 26 November 1991 when Rotherham United eliminated Scunthorpe United.\nFrom 1980\u201381 to 1998\u201399, the semi-finals went to extra time on the day if the score after 90 minutes was a draw. If the score was still level after extra time, the match would go to a replay. Replays for the semi-finals were scrapped for 1999\u20132000; the last semi-final to go into a replay was in 1998\u201399, when Manchester United beat rivals Arsenal 2\u20131 after extra time, following a 0\u20130 draw in the original match.\nThe first FA Cup Final to go to extra time and a replay was the 1875 final, between the Royal Engineers and the Old Etonians. The initial tie finished 1\u20131 but the Royal Engineers won the replay 2\u20130 in normal time. The last replayed final was the 1993 FA Cup Final, when Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday fought a 1\u20131 draw. The replay saw Arsenal win the FA Cup, 2\u20131 after extra time.\nThe last quarter-final to go to a replay was Manchester United vs West Ham United in the 2015\u201316 FA Cup. The original game at Old Trafford ended in a 1\u20131 draw, while Manchester United won the replay at the Boleyn Ground, 2\u20131. It was also the last FA Cup game ever played at the Boleyn Ground.\nThe last fifth round replay saw Tottenham Hotspur defeat Rochdale 6\u20131 at Wembley in the 2017\u201318 FA Cup after the first match at Spotland Stadium ended in a 2\u20132 draw.\nQualification for subsequent competitions.\nEuropean football.\nThe FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup); they previously entered the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup from its launch in 1960 until its final edition in 1998. This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight. In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead. FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage but losing finalists, if they had not qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage. During the Cup Winners' Cup era, if a team had already qualified for the UEFA Cup, they were be promoted to the Cup Winners' Cup and their initial UEFA Cup berth would be transferred to the next league team. From the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition. If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European Competition through their Premier League position, the Europa League berth is then given to the highest placed team in the Premier League who has not yet qualified for a European Competition.\nFA Community Shield.\nThe FA Cup winners also qualify for the following season's single-match FA Community Shield, the traditional season opener played against the previous season's Premier League champions (or the Premier League runners-up if the FA Cup winners also won the league \u2013 the double).\nVenues.\nFixtures in the 12 rounds of the competition are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams. The semi-finals and final are played at a neutral venue \u2013 the rebuilt Wembley Stadium.\nCompetition rounds.\nIn the matches for the 12 competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn \u2013 simply the first team drawn out for each fixture. Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams. However, since 2003, clubs cannot move grounds to the away side's for capacity or financial reasons. If any move has to be made, it has to be to a neutral venue and any additional monies earned by the move goes into the central pot. In the event of a draw, the replay is played at the ground of the team who originally played away from home.\nIn the days when multiple replays were possible, the second replay (and any further replays) were played at neutral grounds. The clubs involved could alternatively agree to toss for home advantage in the second replay.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since 2008, one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007). For the first decade of the competition, the Kennington Oval was used as the semi-final venue. In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel. The top three most used venues in this period were Villa Park in Birmingham (55 times), Hillsborough in Sheffield (34 times) and Old Trafford in Manchester (23 times). The original Wembley Stadium was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring London teams. In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium.\nIn 2003 the FA decided to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium. This was controversial, with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from London, and taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley final. In defending the move, the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers, although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan Athletic led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out. A fan poll by \"The Guardian\" in 2013 found 86% opposition to Wembley semi-finals.\nFinal.\nThe final has been played at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since it opened, in 2007. The rebuilding process meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in Wales. Prior to rebuilding, the final was hosted by the original Wembley Stadium since it opened in 1923 (being originally named the Empire Stadium). One exception to this 78-year series of Empire Stadium finals (including five replays) was the 1970 replay between Leeds United and Chelsea, held at Old Trafford in Manchester.\nIn the 51 years prior to the Empire Stadium opening, the final (including 8 replays) was held in a variety of locations, predominantly in London, and mainly at the Kennington Oval and then Crystal Palace. It was played 22 times at The Oval (the inaugural competition in 1872, and then all but two times until 1892). After The Oval, Crystal Palace hosted 21 finals from 1895 to 1914, broken up by four replays elsewhere. The other London venues were Stamford Bridge from 1920 to 1922 (the last three finals before the move to Empire Stadium); and the University of Oxford's Lillie Bridge in Fulham for the second ever final, in 1873. The other venues used sparingly in this period were all outside of London, as follows:\nArtificial turf.\nThe FA permitted artificial turf (3G) pitches in all rounds of the competition from the 2014\u201315 edition and beyond. Under the 2015\u201316 rules, the pitch must be of FIFA One Star quality, or Two Star for ties if they involve one of the 92 professional clubs. This followed approval two years previously for their use in the qualifying rounds only \u2013 if a team with a 3G pitch progressed to the competition proper, they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible entrant with a natural grass pitch. Having been strong proponents of the surface, the first match in the proper rounds to be played on a 3G surface was a televised first round replay at Maidstone United's Gallagher Stadium on 20 November 2014.\nTrophy.\nThe winners of the competition receive the FA Cup. It is only loaned to the club by the FA; under the current (2015\u201316) rules it must be returned by 1 March, or earlier if given seven days' notice. Traditionally, the holders had the Cup until the following year's presentation, although more recently the trophy has been taken on publicity tours by the FA in between finals.\nThe trophy comes in three parts \u2013 the cup itself, plus a lid and a base. There have been two designs of trophy in use, but five physical trophies have been presented. The original trophy, known as the \"little tin idol\", was 18 inches high and made by Martin, Hall &amp; Co. It was stolen in 1895 and never recovered, and so was replaced by an exact replica, used until 1910. The FA decided to change the design after the 1909 winners, Manchester United, made their own replica, leading the FA to realise they did not own the copyright. This new, larger design was by Fattorini and Sons, and was used from 1911. In order to preserve this original, from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica, although this had to be replaced after just over two decades, after showing wear and tear from being handled more than in previous eras. This third replica, first used in 2014, was built heavier to withstand the increased handling. \nOriginally commissioned in 2013, the current trophy was handcrafted using the similar age-old techniques, including casting, hand-chasing, hand-engraving and polishing. It included many of the trophy\u2019s original features, including grapes, vines and fluting. It also incorporated the base from the previous edition and engraving on the plinth. Speaking at the unveiling of the third trophy in the competition\u2019s history, Alex Horne, the then general secretary of the FA, explained why the FA had taken the decision to replace its 22-year-old predecessor. \u201cThe current trophy is fragile and is too delicate to continue to repair, so must be retired for these reasons,\" he said. \"However, it will remain cherished and will forever be an integral part of The FA Cup\u2019s rich history.\"\u00a0\nKevin Baker, Chief Executive and founder the makers of the current FA Cup trophy, Thomas Lyte, said: \u201cAfter many years of restoring the previous trophy, we are honoured to be making the new FA Cup. This sporting trophy is a national treasure, an icon of English football, and its heritage is embedded within the design and the craft of the new trophy. Thomas Lyte prides itself on the skills of its expert silversmiths and this iconic symbol of competition and fair play couldn\u2019t be in better hands.\u201d \u00a0\nOf the four surviving trophies, only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership.\nThe name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as soon as the final has finished, in order to be ready in time for the presentation ceremony. This means the engraver has just five minutes to perform a task which would take 20 under normal conditions, although time is saved by engraving the year on during the match, and sketching the presumed winner. During the final, the trophy is decorated with ribbons in the colours of both finalists, with the loser's ribbons being removed at the end of the game. The tradition of tying ribbons started after Tottenham Hotspur won the 1901 FA Cup Final and the wife of a Spurs director decided to tie blue and white ribbons to the handles of the cup. Traditionally, at Wembley finals, the presentation is made at the Royal Box, with players, led by the captain, mounting a staircase to a gangway in front of the box and returning by a second staircase on the other side of the box. At Cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch.\nThe tradition of presenting the trophy immediately after the game did not start until the 1882 final; after the first final in 1872 the trophy was not presented to the winners, Wanderers, until a reception held four weeks later in the Pall Mall Restaurant in London. Under the original rules, the trophy was to be permanently presented to any club which won the competition three times, although when inaugural winners Wanderers achieved this feat by the 1876 final, the rules were changed by FA Secretary CW Alcock (who was also captain of Wanderers in their first victory).\nPortsmouth have the distinction of being the football club which has held the FA Cup trophy for the longest uninterrupted period - seven years. Portsmouth had defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 4\u20131 in the 1939 FA Cup Final and were awarded the trophy as 1938\u201339 FA Cup winners. But with the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the regular Football League and FA Cup competitions for the 1939\u201340 season were cancelled for the duration of the war. Portsmouth's manager Jack Tinn was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' throughout the duration of the war, but this is an urban myth. Because the naval city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was actually taken ten miles to the north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of Lovedean, and there it resided in a quaint thatched roof country pub called \"The Bird in Hand\" for the seven years of the war. After the conclusion of World War II, the FA Cup trophy was presented back to the Football Association by the club in time for the 1946 FA Cup Final.\nOriginal design from 1871.\n1871 original.\nThe first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall &amp; Co at a cost of \u00a320. It was stolen from a Birmingham shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by Aston Villa on 11 September 1895 and was never seen again. Despite a \u00a310 reward for information, the crime was never solved. As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa \u00a325 to pay for a replacement.\nJust over 60 years later, 80 year old career criminal Henry (Harry) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft, confessing to a newspaper, with the story being published in the \"Sunday Pictorial\" newspaper on 23 February 1958. He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men, although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the \"Birmingham Post\" newspaper (the crime pre-dated written police reports) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen, detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed. Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins, which matched known intelligence of the time, in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through betting shops at a local racecourse, although Burge had no history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison. He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars. Released in 1961, he died in 1964.\n1895 replica.\nAfter the theft, a replica of the trophy was made, which was used until a redesign of the trophy in 1911. The 1895 replica was then presented to the FA's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird. Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005. It was sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for \u00a3420,000 (\u00a3478,400 including auction fees and taxes). The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the \u00a3254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997. The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation. Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display. It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester. In November 2012, it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers, after they beat Wanderers 7\u20131 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final. In September 2020, Gold sold the replica trophy for \u00a3760,000 through the Bonhams auction house. In January 2021, it was revealed that the trophy had been purchased by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City, who stated that it would be returned on loan to the National Football Museum.\nCurrent design from 1911.\n1911 original.\nThe redesigned trophy first used in 1911 was larger at 61.5\u00a0cm (24.2 inches) high, and was designed and manufactured by Fattorini &amp; Sons of Bradford, coincidentally being won by Bradford City in its first outing.\nOn 27 March 2016 episode of the BBC television programme \"Antiques Roadshow\", this trophy was valued at \u00a31\u00a0million by expert Alastair Dickenson, although he suggested that, due to the design featuring depictions of grapes and vines, it may not have been specifically produced for the FA, but was instead an off-the-shelf design originally meant to be a wine or champagne cooler. This was later disproved when Thomas Fattorini was invited to the Antiques Roadshow to \"ambush\" Alastair Dickenson with the competition winning design by Fattorini &amp; Sons. The show was filmed at Baddesley Clinton and subsequently aired on 23 October 2016.\nA smaller but otherwise identical replica was also made by the company Thomas Fattorini for the North Wales Coast FA Cup trophy which is contested annually by members of that regional Association.\n1992 replica.\nThe 1992 replica was made by Toye, Kenning and Spencer. A copy of this trophy was also produced, in case anything happened to the primary trophy.\n2014 replica.\nThe 2014 replica was made by Thomas Lyte, handcrafted in sterling 925 silver over 250 hours. A weight increase for greater durability has taken it to .\nMedals.\nEach club in the final receives 40 winners or runners-up medals to be distributed among players, staff and officials. The traditional styles of gold-cased medals \u2013 the winners' medal, which had remained largely unchanged since the 1890s, and runners-up medals, which were last updated in 1946 \u2013 were replaced for the 2021 final by new designs of gold winners' medals and silver runners-up medals suspended on a ribbon.\nSponsorship.\nSince the start of the 1994\u201395 season, the FA Cup has been sponsored. However, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's name. Sponsorship deals run for four years, though \u2013 as in the case of E.ON \u2013 one-year extensions may be agreed. Emirates Airline has been the sponsor since 2015, initially renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup', unlike previous editions, which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON' and 'The FA Cup with Budweiser'. The Emirates sponsorship deal, originally scheduled to terminate in 2018, was later extended three times until 2021, 2024, 2028.\nFrom 2006 to 2013, Umbro supplied match balls for all FA Cup matches. They were replaced at the start of the 2013\u201314 season by Nike, who produced the competition's official match ball for five seasons. Mitre took over for the 2018\u201319 season, beginning a three-year partnership with the FA.\nCup runs and giant killings.\nThe possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as a \"giant killing\", is much anticipated by the public. Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup. Almost every club in the League Pyramid has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history. It is considered particularly newsworthy when a top Premier League team suffers an upset defeat, or where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e. from outside The Football League.\nOne analysis of four years of FA Cup results showed that it was 99.85 per cent likely that at least one team would beat one from its next higher division in a given year. The probability drops to 48.8 per cent for a two-division gap, and 39.28 per cent for a three-division gap.\nEarly years.\nThe Football League was founded in 1888, 16 years after the first FA Cup competition. Before its establishment as the dominant football competition in England, teams from rival leagues did make the final of the FA Cup. The Wednesday (later Sheffield Wednesday) in 1890 reached the final as a member of the Football Alliance, two years before that competition merged with the Football League. Later, with the Football League predominantly in the North and Midlands of England, leading clubs of the Southern Football League were of a level with Football League teams, and in 1901 Southern League members Tottenham Hotspur became the only non-League side to win the Cup, while fellow Southern League team Southampton were losing finalists in 1900 and 1902. In 1920\u201321, the Football League expanded to incorporate teams from the Southern League's first division, and the following year it added a further division consisting of leading northern and midlands clubs. This consolidated the Football League's position as the leading competition in English football, and established the hierarchy in which non-League clubs in the English football league system competing in the FA Cup would face Football League teams as clear underdogs.\nNon-League giant killings.\nSince the expansion of the Football League in 1921, the best performance of a team from outside the Football League was National League side Lincoln City's run to the quarter-finals of the 2016\u201317 FA Cup, during which they defeated Championship side Brighton 3\u20131 in the fourth round and Premier League side Burnley 1\u20130 in the fifth, before falling to ultimate Cup champions Arsenal 5\u20130 at the Emirates. Lincoln's defeat of Burnley was only the third (and most recent) FA Cup victory for a non-league team over a top-flight side since 1989. Giant-killings can also be applied where the defeated team is from lower down the Football League, particularly where the defeated club is very notable or the winning team particularly obscure. Liverpool, having already won five league titles in their history, were in the Second Division in 1959 when they lost 2\u20131 to Worcester City of the Southern League.\nThe best-known non-league giant-killing came in the 1971\u201372 FA Cup, when non-league Hereford United defeated First Division Newcastle United. Hereford were trailing 1\u20130 with less than seven minutes left in the Third round proper replay, when Hereford's Ronnie Radford scored the equaliser \u2013 a goal still shown regularly when FA Cup fixtures are broadcast. Hereford finished the shocking comeback by defeating Newcastle 2\u20131 in the match. They finished that season as runners-up of the Southern League, behind Chelmsford City, and were voted into the Football League at the expense of Barrow.\nSome small clubs gain a reputation for being \"cup specialists\" after two or more giant killing feats within a few years. Yeovil Town hold the record for the most victories over league opposition as a non-league team, having recorded 20 wins through the years before they achieved promotion into The Football League in 2003. The record for a club which has never entered the Football League is held by Altrincham, with 17 wins against league teams.\nNon-League cup runs.\nFor non-League teams, reaching the third round proper \u2013 where all Level 1 sides now enter \u2013 is considered a major achievement. In the 2008\u201309 FA Cup, a record eight non-League teams achieved this feat. As of the 2023\u201324 season, only eleven non-League teams have reached the fifth round proper (last 16) since 1925, and only Lincoln City have progressed to the quarter-finals (last 8), during the 2016\u201317 edition of the tournament.\nChasetown, while playing at Level 8 of English football during the 2007\u201308 competition, were the lowest-ranked team to ever play in the third round proper (final 64, of 731 teams entered that season). Chasetown was then a member of the Southern League Division One Midlands (a lower level within the Southern Football League), when they lost to Football League Championship (Level 2) team Cardiff City, the eventual FA Cup runners-up that year. Their success earned the lowly organisation over \u00a360,000 in prize money. Marine matched this in the 2020\u201321 competition as a member of the Northern Premier League Division One North West, and were drawn against Premier League (Level 1) team Tottenham Hotspur, to whom they lost 5\u20130.\nDuring the 2023\u201324 season, Maidstone United in the National League South (Level 6) had an 8\u2013game cup run, reaching the fifth round when they won 2\u20131 away at EFL Championship (Level 2) side Ipswich Town. Their run ended at the fifth round after losing 5\u20130 away to another EFL Championship side Coventry City. They became the eleventh non\u2013League team to reach the fifth round, and the lowest-ranked team to do so since Blyth Spartans (Level 7) in 1977\u201378. Maidstone's co\u2013owner Oliver Ash stated that their cup run had earned the club 'something like \u00a3700,000 before tax'.\nGiant killings between League clubs.\nGiant-killings can apply to matches between league clubs, particularly where teams from tier 4 have defeated tier 1 sides. In games between League sides, one of the most notable results was the 1992 victory by Wrexham, bottom of the previous season's League (avoiding relegation due to expansion of The Football League), over reigning champions Arsenal. Another similar shock was when Shrewsbury Town beat Everton 2\u20131 in 2003. Everton finished seventh in the Premier League and Shrewsbury Town were relegated to the Football Conference that same season.\nIn the 2024\u201325 FA Cup, Championship side Plymouth Argyle caused upsets by beating Premier League teams Brentford 1-0 (in the third round), and Liverpool 1-0 (in the fourth round), before being eliminated by Manchester City 3-1 (in the fifth round).\nWinners and finalists.\nResults by team.\nSince its establishment, the FA Cup has been won by 44 clubs. Teams shown in \"italics\" are no longer in existence. Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887.\nConsecutive winners.\nFour clubs have won consecutive FA Cups on more than one occasion: Wanderers (1872, 1873 and 1876, 1877, 1878), Blackburn Rovers (1884, 1885, 1886 and 1890, 1891), Tottenham Hotspur (1961, 1962 and 1981, 1982) and Arsenal (2002, 2003 and 2014, 2015).\nWinning managers.\nThe record for most titles for a manager is held by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who won the FA Cup with Arsenal seven times (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2015, 2017). Wenger is also the only manager to have won the Cup at the old Wembley Stadium, the Millennium Stadium, and the new Wembley Stadium.\nDoubles/Trebles.\nManchester City (2019) are the only club to have achieved a domestic treble of league, FA Cup and League Cup, having beaten Chelsea 4\u20133 on penalties in the League Cup Final, finished at the top of the Premier League, and beaten Watford 6\u20130 in the FA Cup Final.\nManchester United (1999) and Manchester City (2023) are the only two English teams to have won the continental treble of league, FA Cup, and Champions League. They are two of only nine European sides to do so. Liverpool won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup in (2001) to complete a cup treble.\nEight clubs have won the FA Cup as part of a league and cup double, namely Preston North End (1889), Aston Villa (1897), Tottenham Hotspur (1961), Arsenal (1971, 1998, 2002), Liverpool (1986), Manchester United (1994, 1996, 1999), Chelsea (2010) and Manchester City (2019, 2023). In 1993, Arsenal became the first side to win both the FA Cup and the League Cup in the same season when they beat Sheffield Wednesday in both finals. Liverpool (2001, 2022), Chelsea (2007) and Manchester City (2019) have since repeated this feat. In 2012, Chelsea won both the FA Cup and the Champions League.\nOutside England.\nThe FA Cup has only been won by a non-English team once. Cardiff City achieved this in 1927 when they beat Arsenal in the final at Wembley. They had previously made it to the final only to lose to Sheffield United in 1925 and lost another final to Portsmouth in 2008. Cardiff City are also the only team to win the national cups of two countries in the same season, having also won the Welsh Cup in 1927. The Scottish team Queen's Park reached and lost the final in both 1884 and 1885.\nOutside the top division.\nSince the creation of the Football League in 1888, the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division, and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight: Notts County (1894); Tottenham Hotspur (1901); Wolverhampton Wanderers (1908); Barnsley (1912); West Bromwich Albion (1931); Sunderland (1973), Southampton (1976) and West Ham United (1980). With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) \u2013 Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League's creation. Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902, then in the Southern League) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers.\nSunderland's win in 1973 was considered a major upset, having beaten Leeds United who finished third in the top flight that season, as was West Ham's victory over Arsenal in 1980 as the Gunners were in their third successive FA Cup Final and were the cup holders and just having finished 4th in the First Division, whereas West Ham had ended the season 7th in Division 2. This also marked the last time (as of 2023\u201324) a team from outside the top division won the FA Cup. Uniquely, in 2008 three of the four semi-finalists (Barnsley, Cardiff City and West Bromwich) were from outside the top division, although the eventual winner was the last remaining top-flight team, Portsmouth. West Bromwich (1931) are the only team to have won the FA Cup and earned promotion to the top flight in the same season; whereas Wigan Athletic (2013) are the only team to have won the Cup and been relegated from the top flight in the same season.\nMedia coverage.\nDomestic broadcasters.\nThe FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events.\nIn the early years of coverage the BBC had exclusive radio coverage with a picture of the pitch marked in the \"Radio Times\" with numbered squares to help the listener follow the match on the radio. The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in 1926 between Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City but this was only broadcast in Manchester, the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff City in 1927. The first final on BBC Television was in 1937 in a match which featured Sunderland and Preston North End but this was not televised in full. The following season's final between Preston and Huddersfield Town was covered in full by the BBC. When ITV was formed in 1955 they shared final coverage with the BBC in one of the only club matches shown live on television, during the 1970s and 1980s coverage became more elaborate with BBC and ITV trying to steal viewers from the others by starting coverage earlier and earlier some starting as early as 9\u00a0a.m. which was six hours before kick off. The sharing of rights between BBC and ITV continued from 1955 to 1988, when ITV lost coverage to the BBC. From 1988 to 1997, the BBC was the exclusive broadcaster of the competition on terrestrial television and covered the competition from the third round onwards, showing one live match per round alongside highlights.\nIn 1990, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) obtained rights to the competition, and showed a live match from rounds 1 and 2. This continued to be the case after Sky took over BSB in 1991.\n1997 to 2001.\nFrom 1997 to 2001, Sky owned the coverage showing one match per round, with the free-to-air rights sublicensed to ITV who showed an additional match from the third round onwards. The BBC continued with highlights on \"Match of the Day\".\n2001 to 2008.\nFrom 2001 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two.\nUntil the 2008\u201309 season, the BBC and Sky Sports shared television coverage, with the BBC showing three matches in the earlier rounds. Some analysts argued the decision to move away from the Sky and, in particular, the BBC undermined the FA Cup in the eyes of the public.\n2008 to 2009.\nFrom 2008\u201309 to 2013\u201314, FA Cup matches were shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland. Scottish member STV refused to show them, and instead the regularly advertised programming that otherwise would mostly have been shown across the UK (new and repeated network entertainment and drama content, films, local productions etc.) would continue as normal in a delayed or exclusive fashion while the rest of the ITV network aired the football. ITV showed 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live. The final was also shown live on ITV. Under the same 2008 contract, Setanta Sports showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's matches, albeit with their own commentary teams, exclusively to Scotland, after STV's decision to replace the games with regular programming. Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and England internationals.\nThe early rounds of the 2008\u201309 competition were covered for the first time by ITV's online service, ITV Local. The first match of the competition, between Wantage Town and Brading Town, was broadcast live online. Highlights of eight games of each round were broadcast as catch up on ITV Local. Since ITV Local closed, this coverage did not continue.\n2009 to 2010.\nAs a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009\u201310 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. Many expected BSkyB to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009\u201310 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final.\nIn October 2009, The FA announced that ITV would show an additional match in the First and second rounds on ITV, with one replay match shown on ITV4. One match and one replay match from the first two rounds will broadcast on The FA website for free, in a similar situation to the 2010 World Cup Qualifier between Ukraine and England. The 2009\u201310 first-round match between Oldham Athletic and Leeds United was the first FA Cup match to be streamed online live.\n2010 to 2014.\nESPN bought the competition for the 2010\u201311 to 2012\u201313 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK.\nESPN took over the package Setanta held for the FA Cup from the 2010\u201311 season. The 2011 final was also shown live on Sky 3D in addition to ESPN (who provided the 3D coverage for Sky 3D) and ITV. Following the sale of ESPN's UK and Ireland channels to BT, ESPN's rights package transferred to BT Sport from the 2013\u201314 season.\nSTV would continue to broadcast regular programming in place of FA Cup games, live draws and highlights shows throughout this period, although it did the broadcast the 2014 final live.\n2014 to 2019.\nITV lost the rights to the FA Cup beginning with the 2014\u201315 FA Cup, terrestrial rights returned to BBC Sport, with the final being shown on BBC One while BT Sport hold the pay TV rights. Under this deal, the BBC will show around the same number of games as ITV and still having the first pick for each round.\nMatches involving Welsh clubs are sometimes exclusively broadcast on Welsh language channel S4C, which is also available to view across the rest of the United Kingdom on satellite and cable television, and through the channel's website. A similar arrangement is shared with BBC Cymru Wales when the corporation obtained the rights from 2014 to 2015, potentially giving the BBC an extra match per round.\n2019 onwards.\nOn 23 May 2019, it was announced that ITV would replace BT Sport in broadcasting the FA Cup from the 2021\u201322 season, this new deal will see BBC and ITV become joint broadcasters of the tournament for the first time since 1988, this will mean for the first time that all FA Cup matches would all be exclusively broadcast on free-to-air television.\nIn addition, full coverage of the tournament returned to STV in Scotland, after the broadcaster replaced content from the competition with regular network programmes (and local content made in Scotland, plus films and specials) during the 2008 to 2014 period that ITV last held the rights.\nBBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport provides radio coverage including several full live commentaries per round, with additional commentaries broadcast on BBC Local Radio."}
{"id": "11238", "revid": "4436277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11238", "title": "Fenway Park", "text": "Fenway Park is a ballpark located in Boston, Massachusetts, less than one mile from Kenmore Square. Since 1912, it has been the home field of Major League Baseball's (MLB) Boston Red Sox. While the stadium was built in 1912, it was substantially rebuilt in 1934, and underwent major renovations and modifications in the 21st century.\nIt is the oldest active ballpark in MLB. Because of its age and constrained location in Boston's dense Fenway\u2013Kenmore neighborhood, the park has many quirky features, including \"The Triangle\", Pesky's Pole, and the Green Monster in left field. It is the fifth-smallest among MLB ballparks by seating capacity, second-smallest by total capacity, and one of nine that cannot accommodate at least 40,000 spectators.\nFenway has hosted the World Series eleven times, with the Red Sox winning six of them and the Boston Braves winning one. Besides baseball games, it has also been the site of many other sporting and cultural events including professional football games for the Boston Redskins, Boston Yanks, and the Boston Patriots; concerts; soccer and hockey games (such as the 2010 NHL Winter Classic); and political and religious campaigns.\nOn March 7, 2012 (Fenway's centennial year), the park was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is a landmark at the end of the Boston Irish heritage trail. Former pitcher Bill Lee has called Fenway Park \"a shrine\". It is a pending Boston Landmark, which will regulate any further changes to the park. The ballpark is considered to be one of the most well-known sports venues in the world and a symbol of Boston.\nHistory.\nIn 1911, while the Red Sox were still playing on Huntington Avenue Grounds, owner John I. Taylor purchased the land bordered by Brookline Avenue, Jersey Street, Van Ness Street and Lansdowne Street and developed it into a larger baseball stadium known as Fenway Park. Taylor claimed the name Fenway Park came from its location in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston, which was partially created late in the nineteenth century by filling in marshland or \"fens\", to create the Back Bay Fens urban park. However, given that Taylor's family also owned the Fenway Realty Company, the promotional value of the naming at the time has been cited as well.\nLike many classic ballparks, Fenway Park was constructed on an asymmetrical block, with consequent asymmetry in its field dimensions. The park was designed by architect James E. McLaughlin, and the General Contractor was the Charles Logue Building Company.\nThe first game was played April 20, 1912, with mayor John F. Fitzgerald throwing out the first pitch and Boston defeating the New York Highlanders, 7\u20136 in 11 innings. Newspaper coverage of the opening was overshadowed by continuing coverage of the \"Titanic\" sinking five days earlier.\nIn June 1919, a rally supporting Irish Independence turned out nearly 50,000 supporters to see the President of the Irish Republic, \u00c9amon de Valera, and was allegedly the largest crowd ever in the ballpark.\nThe park's address was originally 24 Jersey Street. In 1977, the section of Jersey Street nearest the park was renamed Yawkey Way in honor of longtime Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey, and the park's address was 4 Yawkey Way until 2018, when the street's name was reverted to Jersey Street in light of current Red Sox ownership distancing itself from Yawkey due to his history of racism (the Red Sox were the last team in Major League Baseball to integrate). The address is now 4 Jersey Street.\nChanges to Fenway Park.\nSome of the changes include:\nNew Fenway Park.\nOn May 15, 1999, then-Red Sox CEO John Harrington announced plans for a new Fenway Park to be built near the existing structure. It was to have seated 44,130 and would have been a modernized replica of the current Fenway Park, with the same field dimensions except for a shorter right field and reduced foul territory. Some sections of the existing ballpark were to be preserved (mainly the original Green Monster and the third base side of the park) as part of the overall new layout. Most of the current stadium was to be demolished to make room for new development, with one section remaining to house a baseball museum and public park. The proposal was highly controversial; it projected that the park had less than 15 years of usable life, would require hundreds of millions of dollars of public investment, and was later revealed to be part of a scheme by current ownership to increase the marketable value of the team as they were ready to sell. Several groups (such as \"Save Fenway Park\") formed in an attempt to block the move.\nA significant renovation of Fenway Park stretched over a 10-year period beginning around 2002 headed by Janet Marie Smith, then Vice President of Planning and Development for the Sox. The Boston Globe has described Smith as \"the architect credited with saving Fenway Park.\" At completion of the renovations, it was reported that Fenway Park remains usable until as late as 2062.\nCapacity and sellout streak.\nFenway's capacity differs between day and night games because, during day games, the seats in center field (Section 35) are covered with a black tarp in order to provide a batter's eye.\nFenway's lowest attendance was recorded on October 1, 1964, when a game against the Cleveland Indians drew only 306 paid spectators.\nOn May 15, 2003, the Red Sox game against the Texas Rangers sold out, beginning a sellout streak that lasted until 2013. On September 8, 2008, when the Red Sox hosted the Tampa Bay Rays, Fenway Park broke the all-time Major League record for consecutive sellouts with 456, surpassing the record previously held by Jacobs Field in Cleveland. On June 17, 2009, the park celebrated its 500th consecutive Red Sox sellout. According to WBZ-TV, the team joined three NBA teams which achieved 500 consecutive home sellouts. The sellout streak ended on April 10, 2013 (with an attendance of 30,862) after the Red Sox sold out 794 regular season games and an additional 26 postseason games.\nFeatures.\nThe park is located along Lansdowne Street and Jersey Street in the Kenmore Square area of Boston. The area includes many buildings of similar height and architecture and thus it blends in with its surroundings. When pitcher Roger Clemens arrived in Boston for the first time in 1984, he took a taxi from Logan Airport and was sure the driver had misunderstood his directions when he announced their arrival at the park. Clemens recalled telling the driver \"No, Fenway Park, it's a baseball stadium\u00a0... this is a warehouse.\" Only when the driver told Clemens to look up and he saw the light towers did he realize he was in the right place.\nFenway Park is one of the two remaining jewel box ballparks still in use in Major League Baseball, the other being Wrigley Field; both have a significant number of obstructed view seats, due to pillars supporting the upper deck. These are sold as such, and are a reminder of the architectural limitations of older ballparks.\nGeorge Will asserts in his book \"\" that Fenway Park is a \"hitters' ballpark\", with its short right-field fence (302\u00a0feet), narrow foul ground (the smallest of any current major league park), and generally closer-than-normal outfield fences. By Rule 1.04, Note(a), all parks built after 1958 have been required to have foul lines at least long and a center-field fence at least from home plate. (This rule had the unintended consequence of leading to the \"Cookie-Cutter Stadium\" era, which ended when Camden Yards opened in 1992.) Regarding the narrow foul territory, Will writes:\nWill states that some observers might feel that these unique aspects of Fenway give the Red Sox an advantage over their opponents, given that the Red Sox hitters play 81 games at the home stadium while each opponent plays no more than seven games as visiting teams but Will does not share this view.\nFenway Park's bullpen wall is much lower than most other outfield walls; outfielders are known to end up flying over this wall when chasing balls hit that direction, such as with Torii Hunter when chasing a David Ortiz game-tying grand slam that direction in game 2 of the 2013 ALCS.\nThe Green Monster.\nThe Green Monster is the nickname of the left field wall in the park. It is located from home plate; this short distance often benefits right-handed hitters.\nPart of the original ballpark construction of 1912, the wall is made of wood, but was covered in tin and concrete in 1934, when the scoreboard was added. The wall was covered in hard plastic in 1976. The scoreboard is manually updated throughout the game. If a ball in play goes through a hole in the scoreboard while the scorers are replacing numbers, the batter is awarded a ground rule double. Similarly, if a batter hits a ball into the balls, strikes, and out lights, it is also ruled a ground rule double.\nThe inside walls of the Green Monster are covered with players' signatures from over the years. Despite the name, the Green Monster was not painted green until 1947; before that, it was covered with advertisements. The \"Monster\" designation is relatively new; for most of its history, it was simply called \"the wall.\" In 2003, terrace-style seating was added on top of the wall.\n\"The Triangle\".\n\"The Triangle\" is a region of center field where the walls form a triangle whose far corner is from home plate. That deep right-center point is conventionally given as the center field distance. The true center is unmarked, from home plate, to the left of \"the Triangle\" when viewed from home plate.\nThere was once a smaller \"Triangle\" at the left end of the bleachers in center field, posted as . The end of the bleachers form a right angle with the Green Monster and the flagpole stands within that little triangle. That is not the true power alley, but deep left-center. The true power alley distance is not posted. The foul line intersects with the Green Monster at nearly a right angle, so the power alley could be estimated at , assuming the power alley is 22.5\u00b0 away from the foul line as measured from home plate.\n\"Williamsburg\".\n\"Williamsburg\" was the name, invented by sportswriters, for the bullpen area built in front of the right-center field bleachers in 1940. It was built there primarily for the benefit of Ted Williams, to enable him and other left-handed batters to hit more home runs, since it was closer than the bleacher wall.\nThe Lone Red Seat.\nThe lone red seat in the right field bleachers (Section 42, Row 37, Seat 21) signifies the longest home run ever hit at Fenway. The home run, hit by Ted Williams on June 9, 1946, was officially measured at , well beyond \"Williamsburg\". According to Hit Tracker Online, the ball, if unobstructed, would have flown .\nThe ball landed on Joseph A. Boucher, penetrating his large straw hat and hitting him in the head. A confounded Boucher was later quoted as saying:\nThere have been other home runs hit at Fenway that have contended for the distance title. In the 2007 book \"The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs\", researcher Bill Jenkinson found evidence that on May 25, 1926, Babe Ruth hit one in the pre-1934 bleacher configuration which landed five rows from the top in right field. This would have placed it at an estimated from home plate. On June 23, 2001, Manny Ramirez hit one that struck a light tower above the Green Monster, which would have cleared the park had it missed. The park's official estimate placed the home run one foot short of Williams' record at . An April 2019 home run by Rowdy Tellez of the Toronto Blue Jays was initially reported as , but later found to be significantly shorter, approximately .\nFoul poles.\nPesky's Pole is the name for the pole on the right field foul line, which stands from home plate, the shortest outfield distance (left or right field) in Major League Baseball. Like the measurement of the left-field line at Fenway Park, this has been disputed. Aerial shots show it to be noticeably shorter than the (actual) 302 foot line in right field, and Pesky has been quoted as estimating it to be \"around 295 feet\". There is no distance posted on the wall.\nDespite the short wall, home runs in this area are relatively rare, as the fence curves away from the foul pole sharply. The pole was named after Johnny Pesky, a non-power-hitting shortstop and long-time coach for the Red Sox, who hit some of his six home runs at Fenway Park around the pole but never off the pole. Pesky (playing 1942 to 1952, except for 1943 to 1945) was a contact hitter who hit just 17 home runs in his career (6 at Fenway Park). It's not known how many of these six actually landed near the pole. The Red Sox give credit to pitcher (and later, Sox broadcaster) Mel Parnell for coining the name. The most notable for Pesky is a two-run homer in the eighth inning of the 1946 Opening Day game to win the game. According to Pesky, Mel Parnell named the pole after Pesky won a game for Parnell in with a home run down the short right field line, just around the pole. However, Pesky hit just one home run in a game pitched by Parnell, a two-run shot in the first inning of a game against Detroit played on June 11, 1950. The game was eventually won by the visiting Tigers in the 14th inning on a three-run shot by Tigers right fielder Vic Wertz and Parnell earned a no-decision that day.\nThe term, though it had been in use since the 1950s, became far more common when Parnell became a Red Sox broadcaster in 1965. Mark Bellhorn hit what proved to be the game-winning home run off of Juli\u00e1n Tav\u00e1rez in game 1 of the 2004 World Series off that pole's screen.\nOn September 27, 2006, Pesky's 87th birthday, the Red Sox officially dedicated the right field foul pole as \"Pesky's Pole\", with a commemorative plaque placed at its base.\nThe seat directly on the foul side of Pesky's Pole in the front row is Section 94, Row E, Seat 5 and is usually sold as a lone ticket.\nIn a ceremony before the Red Sox' 2005 game against the Cincinnati Reds, the pole on the left field foul line atop the Green Monster was named the Fisk Foul Pole, or \"Pudge's Pole\", in honor of Carlton Fisk. Fisk provided one of baseball's most enduring moments in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series against the Reds. Facing Reds right-hander Pat Darcy in the 12th inning with the score tied at 6, Fisk hit a long fly ball down the left field line. It appeared to be heading foul, but Fisk, after initially appearing unsure of whether or not to continue running to first base, famously jumped and waved his arms to the right as if to somehow direct the ball fair. It ricocheted off the foul pole, winning the game for the Red Sox and sending the series to a seventh and deciding game the next night, which Cincinnati won. Like Johnny Pesky's No. 6, Carlton had his No. 27 player number retired by the team.\n\"Duffy's Cliff\".\nFrom 1912 to 1933, there was a high incline in front of the then -high left field wall at Fenway Park, extending from the left-field foul pole to the center field flag pole (and thus under \"The Triangle\" of today). As a result, a left fielder had to play part of the territory running uphill (and back down). Boston's first star left fielder, Duffy Lewis, mastered the skill so well that the area became known as \"Duffy's Cliff\".\nThe incline served two purposes: it was a support for a high wall and it was built to compensate for the difference in grades between the field and Lansdowne Street on the other side of that wall. The wall also served as a spectator-friendly seating area during the dead ball era when overflow crowds, in \"front\" of the later Green Monster, would sit on the incline behind ropes.\nAs part of the 1934 remodeling of the ballpark, the bleachers, and the wall itself, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey arranged to flatten the ground along the base of the wall, so that Duffy's Cliff no longer existed. The base of the left field wall is several feet below the grade level of Lansdowne Street, accounting for the occasional rat that might spook the scoreboard operators.\nThere has been debate as to the true left field distance, which was once posted as . A reporter from \"The Boston Globe\" was able to sneak into Fenway Park and measure the distance. When the paper's evidence was presented to the club in 1995, the distance was remeasured by the Red Sox and restated at . The companion sign remained unchanged until 1998, when it was corrected to .\nDell EMC Club.\nIn 1983, private suites were added to the roof behind home plate. In 1988, 610 stadium club seats enclosed in glass and named the \"600 Club\", were added above the home plate grandstand replacing the existing press box. The press box was then added to the top of the 600 Club. The 1988 addition has been thought to have changed the air currents in the park to the detriment of hitters. In 2002, the organization renamed the club seats the \".406 Club\" (in honor of Ted Williams' batting average in 1941).\nBetween the 2005 and 2006 seasons the existing .406 club was rebuilt as part of the continuing ballpark expansion efforts. The second deck now features two open-air levels: the bottom level is the new \"Dell EMC Club\" featuring 406 seats and concierge services and the upper level, the State Street Pavilion, has 374 seats and a dedicated standing room area. The added seats are wider than the previous seats.\nStatues.\nOutside Gate 5 is \"The Teammates\" statue, by Antonio Tobias Mendez, which depicts Red Sox players Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, Ted Williams, and Johnny Pesky. It was unveiled in 2010.\nThere is also a solo statue of Williams, unveiled in 2004, depicting him placing his cap on the head of a young boy.\nProgram hawkers.\nIn 1990, Mike Rutstein started handing out the first issue of \"Boston Baseball Magazine\" (originally called \"Baseball Underground\") outside of the park. He was frustrated with the quality of the program being sold inside the park, which also came out once every two months. The program was sold for $1, half the cost of the programs inside the park. To sell the program, Rutstein's employees would stand outside the park wearing bright red shirts and greet fans by holding a program up and shouting \"Program, Scorecard, One Dollar!\". By 1992, the Red Sox organization filed complaints with the city code enforcement arguing that the scorecard inside the magazine was not covered under the First Amendment protecting magazines and that Rutstein's employees were operating on the streets without a permit. Despite a lot of attention in the news, Rutstein said the charges were not pursued and no further legal action was taken. In 2012, one of Rutstein's long time employees Sly Egidio quit Boston Baseball to start \"The Yawkey Way Report\" named after Yawkey Way. By that time, Boston Baseball was selling for $3 per program, $2 cheaper than the in-park programs selling for $5. The Yawkey Way Report cost $1 and Egidio stationed his hawkers close to Boston Baseball's hawkers, starting a \"hawker war.\" The Yawkey Way Report also came with baseball cards, ponchos and tote bags, which caused Rutstein to file his own complaints with Boston city code enforcement. Despite the rivalry, both programs continue to be hawked outside of Fenway Park and are often the first thing fans see when they approach the stadium on game-day.\nUse.\nBaseball.\nThe Red Sox' one-time cross-town rivals, the Boston Braves, used Fenway Park for the 1914 World Series and the 1915 season until Braves Field was completed; ironically, the Red Sox would then use Braves Field \u2013 which had a much higher seating capacity \u2013 for their own World Series games in 1915 and 1916.\nSince 1990 (except in 2005 when, because of field work, it was held in a minor league ballpark, and 2020, as the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Fenway Park has also hosted the final round of a Boston-area intercollegiate baseball tournament called the Baseball Beanpot, an equivalent to the more well-known hockey Beanpot tourney. The teams play the first rounds in minor league stadiums before moving on to Fenway for the final and a consolation game. Boston College, Harvard University, Northeastern University, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst compete in the four-team tournament.\nSince at least 1997 Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" has been played at Fenway Park during Red Sox games, in the middle of the eighth inning since 2002. On opening night of the 2010 season at Fenway Park, the song was performed by Diamond himself in the middle of the eighth inning.\nBeginning in 2006, the Red Sox have hosted the \"Futures at Fenway\" event, where two of their minor-league affiliates play a regular-season doubleheader as the \"home\" teams. Before the Futures day started, the most recent minor-league game held at Fenway had been the Eastern League All-Star Game in 1977.\nFrom 1970 to 1987, the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) played its annual all-star game at various major league stadiums. The games were interleague contests between the CCBL and the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League (ACBL). The 1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1987 games were played at Fenway. The MVP of the 1977 contest was future major league slugger Steve Balboni, who clobbered two home runs over the Green Monster that day. The CCBL returned to Fenway in 2009, 2010 and 2011 for its intraleague all-star game matching the league's East and West divisions. The 2009 game starred East division MVP and future Boston Red Sox Chris Sale of Florida Gulf Coast University. The CCBL also holds an annual workout day at Fenway where CCBL players are evaluated by major league scouts.\nBoxing.\nOn October 9, 1920, Fenway Park was the site of the first open-air boxing show in Boston. The card featured four bouts. Although Eddie Shevlin and Paul Doyle fought in the feature bout, Daniel J. Saunders of the \"Boston Daily Globe\" described heavyweights Battling McCreery and John Lester Johnson as \"the only boxers who caused any excitement\". McCreery, who according to Saunders, \"was to take a flop in five rounds\", won by judge's decision in ten rounds. After the fight, Johnson punched McCreery while McCreery was trying to shake his hand. McCreery then knocked Johnson out of the ring and hit him over the head with his chair. The card drew 5,000 spectators (half of what was expected) and brought in $6,100 (several thousand less than what was promised to the fighters).\nIn 1928, New England Welterweight Champion Al Mello headlined three cards at Fenway. He defeated Billy Murphy in front of a crowd of 12,000 on June 26, Charlie Donovan on August 31, and Murphy again on September 13.\nOn July 2, 1930, future World Heavyweight Champion James J. Braddock made his debut in that weight class. He defeated Joe Monte in ten rounds.\nOn September 2, 1930, Babe Hunt defeated Ernie Schaaf in what \"The Boston Daily Globe\" described as a \"dull bout\" and a \"big disappointment\". The undercard included future light heavyweight champion George Nichols, who defeated Harry Allen of Brockton, Massachusetts in ten rounds.\nIn 1932, Eddie Mack promoted ten cards at Fenway Park. The August 2 card featured World Light Heavyweight Champion Maxie Rosenbloom defeating Joe Barlow of Roxbury and Taunton' Henry Emond defeating The Cocoa Kid. On August 23, Dave Shade defeated Norman Conrad of Wilton, New Hampshire in front of 3,500 attendees. The September 6 card was headlined by World junior lightweight champion Kid Chocolate, who defeated Steve Smith.\nOn June 25, 1936, former world heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey defeated Phil Brubaker in what would be his final career victory.\nIn 1937, Rip Valenti and the Goodwin Athletic Club promoted five cards at Fenway. Three of these were headlined by New England Heavyweight Champion Al McCoy. On June 16 McCoy defeated Natie Brown in front of a crowd of 4,516. On July 29 he knocked out Jack McCarthy in the third round. On August 24 he and Tony Shucco fought to a draw. Future WBA featherweight champion Sal Bartolo fought one of his first professional fights on the May 24 undercard.\nOn June 25, 1945, Tami Mauriello knocked out Lou Nova in 2:47. An estimated crowd of 8,000 was in attendance.\nOn July 12, 1954, Tony DeMarco knocked out George Araujo 58 seconds into the fifth round in front of 12,000 spectators.\nThe most recent boxing event at Fenway took place on June 16, 1956. The undercard consisted of Eddie Andrews vs. George Chimenti, Bobby Courchesne vs. George Monroe for the New England Lightweight Championship, and Barry Allison vs. Don Williams for the New England Middleweight Championship. In the main event, Tony DeMarco defeated Vince Martinez by decision. An estimated 15,000 were in attendance - far below promoter Sam Silverman's expectations.\nSoccer.\nOn October 17, 1925, the Boston Soccer Club and the Fall River F.C. of the American Soccer League played a scoreless tie before 4,000 fans. Boston also hosted the Providence Clamdiggers and Indiana Flooring at Fenway later that season. On June 18, 1928, Boston played Rangers F.C. to a 2\u20132 tie in front of a crowd of 10,000. In 1929, Boston hosted two more matches at Fenway Park; a 3\u20132 victory over the New Bedford Whalers on August 10 and a 3\u20132 loss to Fall River on August 17.\nOn May 30, 1931, 8,000 fans were on hand to see the American Soccer League champion New York Yankees defeat Celtic 4\u20133. The Yankees goalkeeper, Johnny Reder, would later return to play for the Boston Red Sox.\nOn May 5, 1967, the park hosted an exhibition between the Atlanta Chiefs and Toronto Falcons of the National Professional Soccer League. The game was a benefit for the Jimmy Fund. The following year, Fenway Park was home to the Boston Beacons of the now-defunct North American Soccer League.\nOn July 21, 2010, Fenway hosted an exhibition game between European soccer clubs Celtic F.C. and Sporting C.P. in an event called \"Football at Fenway\". A crowd of 32,162 watched the two teams play to a 1\u20131 draw. Celtic won 6\u20135 on penalty shoot out, winning the first \"Fenway football challenge Trophy\". Recent matches have taken place between Liverpool, an English Premier League club owned by Fenway Sports Group, and A.S. Roma, an Italian Serie A club owned by FSG partner Thomas R. DiBenedetto. The July 25, 2012 match ended in a 2\u20131 win for AS Roma before a crowd of 37,169. AS Roma also won the rematch on July 23, 2014, by a score of 1\u20130. On July 21, 2019, Liverpool returned to Fenway for a preseason match against Sevilla, the Spanish team won 2\u20131 at the end of full-time.\nAmerican football.\nFootball has been played at Fenway since 1912, the year the venue opened. In 1926, the Boston Bulldogs of the first American Football League played at both Fenway and Braves Field; the Boston Shamrocks of the second American Football League did the same in 1936 and 1937. The Boston Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) played at Fenway for four seasons (1933\u20131936) after playing their inaugural season in 1932 at Braves Field as the Boston Braves. The Boston Yanks played there in the 1940s; and the Boston Patriots of the 1960s American Football League called Fenway Park home from 1963 to 1968 after moving there from Nickerson Field. At various times in the past, Dartmouth College, Boston College, Brown University, and Boston University teams have also played football games at Fenway Park. Boston College and Notre Dame played a game at Fenway in 2015 as part of Notre Dame's Shamrock Series. The annual Harvard\u2013Yale game in November 2018 was played at Fenway.\nIn September 2019, it was announced that the Fenway Bowl, a postseason bowl game, would be played at Fenway Park beginning in 2020, pitting a team from the Atlantic Coast Conference against a team from the American Athletic Conference. However, both the 2020 and 2021 games were canceled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The bowl was finally played for the first time in December 2022, as Louisville defeated Cincinnati.\nProfessional wrestling.\nOn July 9, 1929, World Heavyweight Champion Gus Sonnenberg defeated Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis in front of a crowd of 25,000 at Fenway Park.\nIn 1932, Charlie Gordon promoted shows at Fenway Park. On June 16, 1932, a card headlined by \"The Georgia Leech\" Paul Adams and George Myerson drew 8,000 spectators. 10,000 people turned out on July 6, 1932, to see a show main evented by Ted Germaine and Stewart Spears. The following week, Steve Passas handed German wrestler Mephisto his first loss in the United States at Fenway. The next week's card was headlined by Myerson and Germaine. Myerson was knocked unconscious, but was declared the winner after referee Joe Beston disqualified Germaine for using a choke hold. The card scheduled for July 27 was postponed until August 3 due to rain. It rained again on August 3 and the card was pushed back another week. However, due to a schedule conflict, Steve Passas, was forced to withdraw from his main event bout with Fred Bruno. On August 10, 1932, Adams defeated Louis Poplin in front of 8,000 fans in the substitute main event.\nOn August 18, 1934, a crowd of 30,000 turned out for a card headlined by AWA World Heavyweight Champion Ed Don George and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jim Londos. The fight ended in a draw after 3:14:13.\nOn June 27, 1935, Danno O'Mahony captured the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Londos in front of 30,000 fans.\nOn July 18, 1935, Ed Don George defeated Frank Sexton in an exhibition bout during a musical and athletic carnival benefiting Boston's department of public welfare that also featured a five-mile race, firearms exhibition drill, a boxing exhibition, tug of war contest, and a baseball game. Due to rain, only 5,000 attended the event and the ball game was called off after three innings.\nOn September 10, 1935, O'Mahony successfully defeated his title against George in front of an estimated crowd of 25,000. The bout, the second between O'Mahony and George, was refereed by world heavyweight boxing champion James J. Braddock. The Paul Bowser-promoted card also featured Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis, Frank Sexton, Jack Spellman, and Karl Pojello. During the main event, a spectator suffered a heart attack and died. It was the eighth such death at a Boston wrestling bout in the past two years.\nOn June 29, 1937, around 7,000 spectators saw Steve Casey defeat Ed Don George in a card that also featured Danno O'Mahony, Tor Johnson, and William \"Wee Willie\" Davis. On July 20, 1937, Casey defeated another former world heavyweight champion, Danno O'Mahony, in front of 8,000. On July 26, 1938, Casey successfully defended his AWA World Heavyweight Championship against Dick Shikat before a crowd of 5,000.\nThe WWE (then the World Wide Wrestling Federation), hosted its only event at Fenway Park on June 28, 1969. 17,000 turned out to see WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino defeat Killer Kowalski in a stretcher match and an undercard that featured a steel cage match between The Sheik and Bulldog Brower, a ten-man battle royal won by Mitsu Arakawa, a six-man midget wrestling tag match, a best three out of five falls six woman tag team match\nbetween The Fabulous Moolah, Donna Christanello, and Toni Rose and Vivian Vachon and Rita and Bette Boucher, and singles matches between George Steele and Victor Rivera, Antonio Pugliese and Baron Mikel Scicluna, Dominic DeNucci and Lou Albano, and Ricky Sexton and Duke Savage.\nHockey.\nFenway Park has hosted ice hockey games on five separate occasions, beginning in 2010 when the third annual NHL Winter Classic was held at the stadium on New Year's Day. The Boston Bruins beat the Philadelphia Flyers 2\u20131 in sudden-death overtime, securing the first home-team victory in the relatively short history of the annual series. The 2010 Winter Classic paved the way for further use of the stadium for ice hockey, as the \"Frozen Fenway\" series was introduced. Frozen Fenway is a semi-annual series of collegiate and amateur games featuring ice hockey teams from local and regional high schools, colleges, and universities. Division I matches between Hockey East rivals have been a staple of the Frozen Fenway series, which has seen games played in 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2023 at the ballpark. When not in use for games, the rink is also opened to the public for free ice skating. Fenway Park became the first stadium to host two Winter Classic games in January 2023, as the Boston Bruins once again secured a 2\u20131 victory, this time defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nHurling and Gaelic football.\nFenway has hosted Gaelic games over the years. On June 6, 1937, Mayo, the All-Ireland Football champions, defeated a Massachusetts team, 17\u20138, and on November 8, 1954, Cork, the All-Ireland Hurling champions, defeated an American line-up, 37\u201328. In more recent times, the Fenway Hurling Classic for the Players Champions Cup has been staged, first in November 2015 when Galway defeated Dublin, and subsequently in November 2017 and November 2018.\nConcerts.\nFenway has been home to various concerts beginning in 1973 when Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles first played there. No further concerts were played there until 2003 when Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played a leg of their The Rising Tour. Since 2003, there has been at least one concert every year at Fenway by such artists as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Jimmy Buffett, Billy Joel, Shakira, Journey, Def Leppard, The Rolling Stones, Neil Diamond, The Police, Jason Aldean, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Dave Matthews Band, Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers, Aerosmith, Phish, Roger Waters, Paul McCartney, James Taylor (2015\u20132017 consecutively: 2015 &amp; 2017 with Bonnie Raitt, 2016 with Jackson Browne), Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Dead &amp; Company and New Kids On The Block 2011 (with Backstreet Boys), 2017 and 2021.\nIn 2017, Lady Gaga brought her Joanne World Tour to the stadium, making her the first woman to headline a concert there. In 2022, she returned with The Chromatica Ball. In 2019, The Who played their first ever show at the stadium with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. On August 3, 2021, Guns N' Roses played a show as a part of their 2020 Tour, where they revealed a new song \"Absurd\". Aerosmith returned for their 50th-anniversary celebrations on September 8, 2022, and the show labeled the venue's highest ticket sales to date.\nOn July 31 and August 1, 2023, Pink performed at the stadium as part of her Summer Carnival tour, and broke the record for biggest two-day attendance.\nSki and snowboard.\nPolartec Big Air At Fenway is the first big air snowboarding and skiing competition that was held on February 11\u201312, 2016. This event was part of the U.S. Grand Prix Tour and the International Ski Federation's World Tour. Notable winter athletes that competed are Ty Walker, Sage Kotsenburg, and Joss Christensen. The big air jump was constructed to be about tall, standing above the lights of the stadium. \nPublic address announcers.\nFrank Fallon was the first public address (PA) announcer for the Red Sox, and held the job from 1953 to 1957. Fred Cusick, better known for his career of announcing Boston Bruins hockey games, joined him in 1956 and also left after 1957. Jay McMaster took over in 1958, until his replacement by Sherm Feller in 1967. Feller served as the announcer for 26 years until his death after the 1993 season. He was known for beginning his games by welcoming the fans with \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Welcome to Fenway Park\", and ending them by saying \"Thank you.\" Leslie Sterling took the job for the 1994 season, becoming the second female PA announcer in the history of Major League Baseball. Ed Brickley took over in 1997, and was replaced by Carl Beane in 2003. Beane was regarded as an \"iconic\" announcer, and served until his death in 2012, which was caused by a heart attack suffered while driving. Fenway used a series of guest announcers to finish the 2012 season before hiring Henry Mahegan, Bob Lobel, and Dick Flavin for 2013. Flavin died after the 2022 season.\nRetired numbers.\nThere are eleven retired numbers above the right field grandstand. The numbers retired by the Red Sox are red on a white circle. Jackie Robinson's 42, which was retired by Major League Baseball, is blue on a white circle. The two are further delineated through the font difference; Boston numbers are in the same style as the Red Sox jerseys, while Robinson's number is in the more traditional \"block\" numbering found on the Dodgers jerseys.\nThe numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9-4-1-8. Dan Shaughnessy pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the 1918 World Series, the last championship that the Red Sox won before 2004. After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order. The numbers remained in numerical order until the 2012 season, when the numbers were rearranged back into the order in which they were retired by the Red Sox.\nThe Red Sox policy on retiring uniform numbers was once one of the most stringent in baseball\u2014the player had to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, play at least 10 years with the team, and retire as a member of the Red Sox. The final requirement was waived for Carlton Fisk as he had finished his playing career with the Chicago White Sox. However, Fisk was assigned a Red Sox front office job and effectively \"finished\" his baseball career with the Red Sox in this manner. In 2008, the ownership relaxed the requirements further with the retirement of Johnny Pesky's number 6. Pesky has not been inducted into the Hall of Fame, but in light of his over 50 years of service to the club, the management made an exception. Pesky would have had 10 seasons, but he was credited with the three seasons he served as an Operations Officer in the U.S. Navy during World War II. The most recent number retired was 34, worn by 2013 World Series Most Valuable Player David Ortiz.\nGround rules.\nIt is a misconception among fans that a fly ball that gets stuck in the ladder above the scoreboard on the left field wall is ruled a ground rule triple. There is no mention of it in the Red Sox ground rules list."}
{"id": "11240", "revid": "9092818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11240", "title": "Flatulence", "text": "Flatulence is the expulsion of gas from the intestines via the anus, commonly referred to as farting. \"Flatus\" is the medical word for gas generated in the stomach or bowels. A proportion of intestinal gas may be swallowed environmental air, and hence flatus is not entirely generated in the stomach or bowels. The scientific study of this area of medicine is termed flatology.\nPassing gas is a normal bodily process. Flatus is brought to the rectum and pressurized by muscles in the intestines. It is normal to pass flatus (\"to fart\"), though volume and frequency vary greatly among individuals. It is also normal for intestinal gas to have a feculent or unpleasant odor, which may be intense. The noise commonly associated with flatulence is produced by the anus and buttocks, which act together in a manner similar to that of an embouchure. Both the sound and odor are sources of embarrassment, annoyance or amusement (flatulence humor). Many societies have a taboo about flatus. Thus, many people either let their flatus out quietly or even hold it completely. However, holding the gases inside is not healthy.\nThere are several general symptoms related to intestinal gas: pain, bloating and abdominal distension, excessive flatus volume, excessive flatus odor, and gas incontinence. Furthermore, eructation (colloquially known as \"burping\") is sometimes included under the topic of flatulence. When excessive or malodorous, flatus can be a sign of a health disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease or lactose intolerance.\nTerminology.\nNon-medical definitions of the term include \"the uncomfortable condition of having gas in the stomach and bowels\", or \"a state of excessive gas in the alimentary canal\". These definitions highlight that many people consider \"bloating\", abdominal distension or increased volume of intestinal gas, to be synonymous with the term flatulence (although this is technically inaccurate).\nColloquially, flatulence may be referred to as \"farting\", \"pumping\", \"trumping\", \"blowing off\", \"pooting\", \"passing gas\", \"breaking wind\", \"backfiring\", \"tooting\", \"beefing\", or simply (in American English) \"gas\" or (British English) \"wind\". Derived terms include vaginal flatulence, otherwise known as a \"queef\". In rhyming slang, blowing a raspberry (at someone) means imitating with the mouth the sound of a fart, in real or feigned derision.\nSigns and symptoms.\nGenerally speaking, there are four different types of complaints that relate to intestinal gas, which may present individually or in combination.\nBloating and pain.\nPatients may complain of bloating as abdominal distension, discomfort and pain from \"trapped wind\". In the past, functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome that produced symptoms of bloating were attributed to increased production of intestinal gas.\nHowever, three significant pieces of evidence refute this theory. First, in normal subjects, even very high rates of gas infusion into the small intestine (30mL/min) is tolerated without complaints of pain or bloating and harmlessly passed as flatus per rectum. Secondly, studies aiming to quantify the total volume of gas produced by patients with irritable bowel syndrome (some including gas emitted from the mouth by eructation) have consistently failed to demonstrate increased volumes compared to healthy subjects. The proportion of hydrogen produced may be increased in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome, but this does not affect the total volume. Thirdly, the volume of flatus produced by patients with irritable bowel syndrome who have pain and abdominal distension would be tolerated in normal subjects without any complaints of pain.\nPatients who complain of bloating frequently can be shown to have objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined with the fact that the total volume of flatus is not increased led to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with bloating. They found that gas was not distributed normally in these patients: there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension. In conclusion, abdominal distension, pain and bloating symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather than increased flatus production.\nExcessive volume.\nThe range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476\u20131,491\u2009mL/24\u2009h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages, or the result of gut fermentation.\nSwallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and has been shown in a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is, however, considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages are likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages.\nEndogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally nearly sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues arrive in the colon.\nTherefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim to reduce the amount of undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.\nOdor.\nAlthough flatus possesses an odor, this may be abnormally increased in some patients and cause social distress to the patient. Increased odor of flatus presents a distinct clinical issue from other complaints related to intestinal gas. Some patients may exhibit over-sensitivity to bad flatus odor, and in extreme forms, olfactory reference syndrome may be diagnosed. Recent informal research found a correlation between flatus odor and both loudness and humidity content.\nIncontinence of flatus.\n\"Gas incontinence\" could be defined as loss of voluntary control over the passage of flatus. It is a recognised subtype of faecal incontinence, and is usually related to minor disruptions of the continence mechanisms. Some consider gas incontinence to be the first, sometimes only, symptom of faecal incontinence.\nCause.\nIntestinal gas is composed of varying quantities of exogenous sources and endogenous sources. The exogenous gases are swallowed (aerophagia) when eating or drinking or increased swallowing during times of excessive salivation (as might occur when nauseated or as the result of gastroesophageal reflux disease). The endogenous gases are produced either as a by-product of digesting certain types of food, or of incomplete digestion, as is the case during steatorrhea. Anything that causes food to be incompletely digested by the stomach or small intestine may cause flatulence when the material arrives in the large intestine, due to fermentation by yeast or prokaryotes normally or abnormally present in the gastrointestinal tract.\nFlatulence-producing foods are typically high in certain polysaccharides, especially oligosaccharides such as inulin. Those foods include beans, lentils, dairy products, onions, garlic, spring onions, leeks, turnips, swedes, radishes, sweet potatoes, potatoes, cashews, Jerusalem artichokes, oats, wheat, and yeast in breads. Cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables that belong to the genus \"Brassica\" are commonly reputed to not only increase flatulence, but to increase the pungency of the flatus.\nIn beans, endogenous gases seem to arise from complex oligosaccharides (carbohydrates) that are particularly resistant to digestion by mammals, but are readily digestible by microorganisms (methane-producing archaea; \"Methanobrevibacter smithii\") that inhabit the digestive tract. These oligosaccharides pass through the small intestine largely unchanged, and when they reach the large intestine, bacteria ferment them, producing copious amounts of flatus.\nWhen excessive or malodorous, flatus can be a sign of a health disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity or lactose intolerance. It can also be caused by certain medicines, such as ibuprofen, laxatives, antifungal medicines or statins. Some infections, such as giardiasis, are also associated with flatulence.\nInterest in the causes of flatulence was spurred by high-altitude flight and human spaceflight; the low atmospheric pressure, confined conditions, and stresses peculiar to those endeavours were cause for concern. In the field of mountaineering, the phenomenon of high altitude flatus expulsion was first recorded over two hundred years ago.\nMechanism.\nProduction, composition, and odor.\nFlatus (intestinal gas) is mostly produced as a byproduct of bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the colon. There are reports of aerophagia (excessive air swallowing) causing excessive intestinal gas, but this is considered rare.\nOver 99% of the volume of flatus is composed of odorless gases. These include oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Nitrogen is not produced in the gut, but a component of environmental air. Patients who have excessive intestinal gas that is mostly composed of nitrogen have aerophagia. Hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane are all produced in the gut and contribute 74% of the volume of flatus in normal subjects. Methane and hydrogen are flammable, and so flatus can be ignited if it contains adequate amounts of these components.\nNot all humans produce flatus that contains methane. For example, in one study of the faeces of nine adults, only five of the samples contained archaea capable of producing methane. The prevalence of methane over hydrogen in human flatus may correlate with obesity, constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, as archaea that oxidise hydrogen into methane promote the metabolism's ability to absorb fatty acids from food.\nThe remaining trace (&lt;1% volume) compounds contribute to the odor of flatus. Historically, compounds such as indole, skatole, ammonia and short chain fatty acids were thought to cause the odor of flatus. More recent evidence proves that the major contribution to the odor of flatus comes from a combination of volatile sulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan (also known as methanethiol), dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide are present in flatus. The benzopyrrole volatiles indole and skatole have an odor of mothballs, and therefore probably do not contribute greatly to the characteristic odor of flatus.\nIn one study, hydrogen sulfide concentration was shown to correlate convincingly with perceived bad odor of flatus, followed by methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide. This is supported by the fact that hydrogen sulfide may be the most abundant volatile sulfur compound present. These results were generated from subjects who were eating a diet high in pinto beans to stimulate flatus production.\nOthers report that methyl mercaptan was the greatest contributor to the odor of flatus in patients not under any specific dietary alterations. It has now been demonstrated that methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, and hydrogen sulfide (described as decomposing vegetables, unpleasantly sweet/wild radish and rotten eggs respectively) are all present in human flatus in concentrations above their smell perception thresholds.\nIt is recognized that increased dietary sulfur-containing amino acids significantly increases the odor of flatus. It is therefore likely that the odor of flatus is created by a combination of volatile sulfur compounds, with minimal contribution from non-sulfur volatiles. This odor can also be caused by the presence of large numbers of microflora bacteria or the presence of faeces in the rectum. Diets high in protein, especially sulfur-containing amino acids, have been demonstrated to significantly increase the odor of flatus.\nVolume and intestinal gas dynamics.\nNormal flatus volume is 476 to 1491 mL per 24 hours. This variability between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly, the number of flatus episodes per day is variable; the normal range is given as 8\u201320 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each flatulence event again varies (5\u2013375\u00a0mL). The volume of the first flatulence upon waking in the morning is significantly larger than those during the day. This may be due to buildup of intestinal gas in the colon during sleep, the peak in peristaltic activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of intestinal gas. It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of intestinal gas present low resistance, and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation. This process is thought not to affect solid and liquid intra-lumenal contents.\nResearchers investigating the role of sensory nerve endings in the anal canal did not find them to be essential for retaining fluids in the anus, and instead speculate that their role may be to distinguish between flatus and faeces, thereby helping detect a need to defecate or to signal the end of defecation.\nThe sound varies depending on the volume of gas, the size of the opening that the air is being pushed through, which is affected by the state of tension in the sphincter muscle, and the force or velocity of the gas being propelled, as well as other factors, such as whether the gas was caused by swallowed air. Among humans, flatulence occasionally happens accidentally, such as incidentally to coughing or sneezing or during orgasm; on other occasions, flatulence can be voluntarily elicited by tensing the rectum or \"bearing down\" on stomach or bowel muscles and subsequently relaxing the anal sphincter, resulting in the expulsion of flatus.\nManagement.\nSince problems involving intestinal gas present as different (but sometimes combined) complaints, the management is cause-related.\nPain and bloating.\nWhile not affecting the production of the gases themselves, surfactants (agents that lower surface tension) can reduce the disagreeable sensations associated with flatulence, by aiding the dissolution of the gases into liquid and solid faecal matter. Preparations containing simethicone reportedly operate by promoting the coalescence of smaller bubbles into larger ones more easily passed from the body, either by burping or flatulence. Such preparations do not decrease the total amount of gas generated in or passed from the colon, but make the bubbles larger and thereby allowing them to be passed more easily.\nOther drugs including prokinetics, lubiprostone, antibiotics and probiotics are also used to treat bloating in patients with functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, and there is some evidence that these measures may reduce symptoms.\nA flexible tube, inserted into the rectum, can be used to collect intestinal gas in a flatus bag. This method is occasionally needed in a hospital setting, when the patient is unable to pass gas normally.\nVolume.\nOne method of reducing the volume of flatus produced is dietary modification, reducing the amount of fermentable carbohydrates. This is the theory behind diets such as the low-FODMAP diet (a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, alcohols, and polyols).\nMost starches, including potatoes, corn, noodles, and wheat, produce gas as they are broken down in the large intestine. Intestinal gas can be reduced by fermenting the beans, and making them less gas-inducing, or by cooking them in the liquor from a previous batch. For example, the fermented bean product miso is less likely to produce as much intestinal gas. Some legumes also stand up to prolonged cooking, which can help break down the oligosaccharides into simple sugars. Fermentative lactic acid bacteria such as \"Lactobacillus casei\" and \"Lactobacillus plantarum\" reduce flatulence in the human intestinal tract.\nProbiotics (live yogurt, kefir, etc.) are reputed to reduce flatulence when used to restore balance to the normal intestinal flora. Live (bioactive) yogurt contains, among other lactic bacteria, \"Lactobacillus acidophilus\", which may be useful in reducing flatulence. \"L. acidophilus\" may make the intestinal environment more acidic, supporting a natural balance of the fermentative processes. \"L. acidophilus\" is available in supplements. Prebiotics, which generally are non-digestible oligosaccharides, such as fructooligosaccharide, generally increase flatulence in a similar way as described for lactose intolerance.\nDigestive enzyme supplements may significantly reduce the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus. The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, lactase, amylase, lipase, protease, cellulase, glucoamylase, invertase, malt diastase, pectinase, and bromelain are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.\nThe antibiotic rifaximin, often used to treat diarrhea caused by the microorganism \"E. coli\", may reduce both the production of intestinal gas and the frequency of flatus events.\nOdor.\nBismuth\nThe odor created by flatulence is commonly treated with bismuth subgallate, available under the name Devrom. Bismuth subgallate is commonly used by individuals who have had ostomy surgery, bariatric surgery, faecal incontinence and irritable bowel syndrome. Bismuth subsalicylate is a compound that binds hydrogen sulfide, and one study reported a dose of 524\u00a0mg four times a day for 3\u20137 days bismuth subsalicylate yielded a &gt;95% reduction in faecal hydrogen sulfide release in both humans and rats.\nAnother bismuth compound, bismuth subnitrate was also shown to bind to hydrogen sulfide. Another study showed that bismuth acted synergistically with various antibiotics to inhibit sulfate-reducing gut bacteria and sulfide production. Some authors proposed a theory that hydrogen sulfide was involved in the development of ulcerative colitis and that bismuth might be helpful in the management of this condition. However, bismuth administration in rats did not prevent them from developing ulcerative colitis despite reduced hydrogen sulfide production. Also, evidence suggests that colonic hydrogen sulfide is largely present in bound forms, probably sulfides of iron and other metals. Rarely, serious bismuth toxicity may occur with higher doses.\n Activated charcoal\nDespite being an ancient treatment for various digestive complaints, activated charcoal did not produce reduction in both the total flatus volume nor the release of sulfur-containing gasses, and there was no reduction in abdominal symptoms (after 0.52g activated charcoal four times a day for one week). The authors suggested that saturation of charcoal binding sites during its passage through the gut was the reason for this. A further study concluded that activated charcoal (4g) does not influence gas formation in vitro or in vivo. Other authors reported that activated charcoal was effective. A study in 8 dogs concluded activated charcoal (unknown oral dose) reduced hydrogen sulfide levels by 71%. In combination with yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate, this was increased to an 86% reduction in hydrogen sulfide, although flatus volume and number was unchanged. An early study reported activated charcoal (unknown oral dose) prevented a large increase in the number of flatus events and increased breath hydrogen concentrations that normally occur following a gas-producing meal.\nGarments and external devices\nIn 1998, Chester \"Buck\" Weimer of Pueblo, Colorado, received a patent for the first undergarment that contained a replaceable charcoal filter. The undergarments are air-tight and provide a pocketed escape hole in which a charcoal filter can be inserted. In 2001 Weimer received the Ig Nobel Prize for Biology for his invention.\nA similar product was released in 2002, but rather than an entire undergarment, consumers are able to purchase an insert similar to a pantiliner that contains activated charcoal. The inventors, Myra and Brian Conant of Mililani, Hawaii, still claim on their website to have discovered the undergarment product in 2002 (four years after Chester Weimer filed for a patent for his product), but state that their tests \"concluded\" that they should release an insert instead.\nIncontinence.\nFlatus incontinence where there is involuntary passage of gas, is a type of faecal incontinence, and is managed similarly.\nSociety and culture.\nIn many cultures, flatulence in public is regarded as embarrassing, but, depending on context, may also be considered humorous. People will often strain to hold in the passing of gas when in polite company, or position themselves to silence or conceal the passing of gas. In other cultures, it may be no more embarrassing than coughing.\nWhile the act of passing flatus in some cultures is generally considered to be an unfortunate occurrence in public settings, flatulence may, in casual circumstances and especially among children, be used as either a humorous supplement to a joke (\"pull my finger\"), or as a comic activity in and of itself. The social acceptability of flatulence-based humour in entertainment and the mass media varies over the course of time and between cultures. A sufficient number of entertainers have performed using their flatus to lead to the coining of the term flatulist. The whoopee cushion is a joking device invented in the early 20th century for simulating a fart. In 2008, a farting application for the iPhone earned nearly $10,000 in one day.\nA farting game named \"Touch Wood\" was documented by John Gregory Bourke in the 1890s. It was known as \"Safety\" in the 20th century in the U.S., and is still played by children as of 2011.\nIn January 2011, the Malawi Minister of Justice, George Chaponda, said that Air Fouling Legislation would make public \"farting\" illegal in his country. When reporting the story, the media satirised Chaponda's statement with punning headlines. Later, the minister withdrew his statement. \nEnvironmental impact.\nFlatulence is often blamed as a significant source of greenhouse gases, owing to the erroneous belief that the methane released by livestock is in the flatus. While livestock account for around 20% of global methane emissions, 90\u201395% of that is released by exhaling or burping. In cows, gas and burps are produced by methane-generating microbes called methanogens, which live inside the cow's digestive system. Proposals for reducing methane production in cows include the feeding of supplements such as oregano and seaweed, and the genetic engineering of gut biome microbes to produce less methane.\nSince New Zealand produces large amounts of agricultural products, it has the unique position of having higher methane emissions from livestock compared to other greenhouse gas sources. The New Zealand government is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol and therefore attempts to reduce greenhouse emissions. To achieve this, an agricultural emissions research levy was proposed, which promptly became known as a \"fart tax\" or \"flatulence tax\". It encountered opposition from farmers, farming lobby groups and opposition politicians.\nEntertainment.\nHistorical comment on the ability to fart at will is observed as early as Saint Augustine's \"City of God\" (5th century A.D.). Augustine mentions \"people who produce at will without any stench such rhythmical sounds from their fundament that they appear to be making music even from that quarter.\" Intentional passing of gas and its use as entertainment for others appear to have been somewhat well known in pre-modern Europe, according to mentions of it in medieval and later literature, including Rabelais.\nLe P\u00e9tomane (\"the Fartomaniac\") was a famous French performer in the 19th century who, as well as many professional farters before him, did flatulence impressions and held shows. The performer Mr. Methane carries on le P\u00e9tomane's tradition today. Also, a 2002 fiction film \"Thunderpants\" revolves around a boy named Patrick Smash who has an ongoing flatulence problem from the time of his birth.\nSince the 1970s, farting has increasingly been featured in film, especially comedies such as \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Scooby-Doo\".\nIn the popular vulgar cartoon series \"South Park,\" characters sometimes watch a show-within-a-show called \"The Terrance and Phillip Show\" whose humor primarily revolves around flatulence.\nPersonal experiences.\nPeople find other peoples' flatus unpleasant, but are unfazed by, and may even enjoy, the scent of their own. While there has been little research carried out upon the subject, some speculative guesses have been made as to why this might be so. For example, one explanation for this phenomenon is that people are very familiar with the scent of their own flatus, and that survival in nature may depend on the detection of and reaction to foreign scents. \nSome people have Eproctophilla, the fetish of flatulence, finding sexual gratification and pleasure from either the sound of the gas, smells from the gas, feeling of the gas, some combination of the three, or all three."}

{"id": "11244", "revid": "1278854936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11244", "title": "Free Methodist Church", "text": "The Free Methodist Church (FMC) is a Methodist Christian denomination within the holiness movement, based in the United States. It is evangelical in nature and is Wesleyan\u2013Arminian in theology.\nThe Free Methodist Church has members in over 100 countries, with 62,516 members in the United States and 1,547,820 members worldwide. The \"Light &amp; Life Magazine\" is their official publication. The Free Methodist Church World Ministries Center is in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nHistory.\nThe Free Methodist Church was organized at Pekin, New York, in 1860. The founders had been members of the Methodist Episcopal Church but were excluded from its membership for earnestly advocating what they saw as the doctrines and usages of authentic Wesleyan Methodism. Under the leadership of the Rev. Benjamin Titus (B. T.) Roberts, a graduate of Wesleyan University, the movement spread rapidly. Societies were organized, churches built, and the work established.\nBefore the founding of the church, Roberts began publication of a monthly journal, \"The Earnest Christian\". In 1868, \"The Free Methodist\" (now \"Light &amp; Life\") was begun. A publishing house was established in 1886 to produce books, periodicals, and Sunday school curriculum and literature.\nThe name \"Methodist\" was retained for the newly organized church because the founders believed that they were continuing the authentic practice of the doctrines and standards of Methodism; to them, their expulsion from the Methodist Episcopal Church happened because of their adherence to the same. The word \"Free\" was suggested and adopted because the new church (1) was anti-slavery; (2) wanted pews to be free to all regardless of status, rather than sold or rented (as was common); (3) promoted freedom of worship in the Holy Spirit, as opposed to stifling formality; (4) upheld the principle of \"freedom\" from secret and oath-bound societies (in particular the Masonic Lodge), so as to have full loyalty to Christ; (5) stood for \"freedom\" from the abuse of ecclesiastical authority (due to the bishop's action in allowing expulsion of 120 clergy and lay); and (6) desired its members to experience entire sanctification via the Holy Spirit through consecration and faith.\nAt the 1910 session of the General Conference of the Methodist Church at Rochester, New York, a full acknowledgement was made of the wrong done to the late Roberts fifty years before, and the credentials taken from him were restored in a public meeting on his behalf to his son, Rev. Benson Roberts.\nHoliness Conservatives within the Free Methodist Church left to form the Reformed Free Methodist Church in 1932, the United Holiness Church in 1966 (which joined the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches in 1994) and the Evangelical Wesleyan Church in 1963.\nFree Methodist headquarters were located in Winona Lake, Indiana until 1990, when the denomination moved to Indianapolis, Indiana.\nThe Free Methodist Church released a 21st Century articulation of its Historic Freedoms to include the following:\nStatistics.\nThe church has about 62,516 members in the United States as of 2021. Worldwide its membership is over 1,500,000. with large segments of membership in East Central Africa (Rwanda, Burundi, DRC) and other countries.\nBeliefs and practices.\nIn doctrine, Free Methodists\u2019 beliefs are the standard beliefs of Wesleyan-Arminian Protestantism, with distinctive emphasis on the teaching of entire sanctification as held by John Wesley, to whom the Free Methodist Church traces its origins.\nThe Free Methodist Church, along with the United Methodist Church, shares a common heritage linked to the Methodist revival in England during the 18th century. The Free Methodist Church itself arose within the context of the holiness movement within 19th century Methodism.\nThe first general superintendent, B. T. Roberts, was in favor of ordaining women, but never saw it take place in his lifetime. Out of his own conviction he wrote \"Ordaining Women: Biblical and Historical Insights\". The impact of his writings eventually prevailed in the church. The Free Methodist Church affirmed the ordination of women in 1911. As of June 2008, women represented 11% of ordained clergy (216 of 2,011) and 26% of candidates for the ministry.\nFree Methodists recognize and license unordained persons for particular ministries. They mandate lay representation in numbers equal to clergy in the councils of the church.\nAs a reaction to paid musicians in the Methodist Episcopal Church, early Free Methodists enjoyed a capella congregational hymns during worship. However, the General Conference of 1943 voted to allow each Conference to vote on whether or not their churches could have instrumental music. As a result, pianos and organs became common across most conferences. Currently, many churches have worship teams composed of vocalists, drums, keyboards, guitars, and other instruments.\nOrganization.\nThe Free Methodist Church's highest governing body is the World Conference, which is composed of representatives, both lay and clergy, from all countries with a Free Methodist General Conference. As the church in each country develops, its status progresses from Mission District to Annual Conference to General Conference. There are currently 20 General Conferences in the world, which are linked together through the articles of religion and common constitution of the first two chapters of the Book of Discipline, the World Conference, and the Council of Bishops.\nThe USA branch of the Free Methodist Church is currently led by three bishops: Bishop Keith Cowart, Bishop Kaye Kolde, and Bishop Kenny Martin. Bishop Cowart was first elected in 2019 and re-elected in 2023. Bishops Kolde and Martin were first elected in 2023.\nWorld Missions.\nFree Methodist World Missions oversees ministries across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Today, 95% of Free Methodists are located outside the United States, and that number is growing daily.\nInternational Child Care Ministries (ICCM), a child sponsorship initiative serves more than 21,000 children in 29 countries around the world. Through education, meals and medical care, children in need are given an opportunity for a better life. Each sponsored child is connected to a Free Methodist congregation or ministry at a local level.\nSet Free Movement is seeking to mobilize faith communities, financial partners, and all segments of society towards ending human trafficking and creating new futures through community-based action.\nVolunteers in Service Abroad (VISA) connects volunteers from the Free Methodist Church in the US and UK with Free Methodist World Missions for hands-on ministry internationally.\nThe church currently has ministry over 88 countries, including:\nHigher education.\nB. T. Roberts began what is now Roberts Wesleyan College in 1866. Spring Arbor College followed in 1873 (renamed Spring Arbor University in 2001), Seattle Pacific University in 1891, and Greenville College (renamed Greenville University in 2017) in 1892. Central College began in 1914, a continuation of Orleans Seminary begun in 1884. Los Angeles Pacific College existed from 1903 to 1965.\nThe following educational institutions are a part of the Association of Free Methodist Educational Institutions. The schools are not owned by the denomination but meet a set of requirements to maintain this relationship.\nIn addition, the Free Methodist Church is one of several denominations supporting Azusa Pacific University (Azusa, CA). Wessington Springs College is a former, now closed institution which was located in South Dakota. Internationally, there is Osaka Christian College of the Japanese Free Methodist Church, Hope Africa University, a recently founded school in Bujumbura, Burundi, Haiti Providence University, and the Faculdade de Teologia Metodista Livre, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\nThrough the John Wesley Seminary Foundation (JWSF) graduate students who are preparing for full-time ministry in the Free Methodist Church are provided a grant or loan at the following affiliated schools:\nPublishing.\nLike John Wesley before him, B. T. Roberts recognized the Christian's responsibility for publishing.\nBefore the founding of the church in 1860, B. T. Roberts began publication of a monthly journal, \"The Earnest Christian\". In 1868 \"The Free Methodist\" (now \"Light &amp; Life\" Magazine) began. A publishing house was established in 1886 to produce books, periodicals and Sunday school curriculum and literature.\nBeginnings.\nEarly leaders, T. B. Arnold and B. T. Roberts privately financed and produced several publications.\nThe official publishing institution was established by the church at the 1886 General Conference. The church purchased the publishing business built by Rev. T. B. Arnold for $8,000. Arnold was named first publisher and B. T. Roberts was elected editor of \"The Free Methodist\". The Free Methodist Publishing House is recognized under its trade name Light and Life Press.\nGrowth and development.\nThe Free Methodist Publishing House operated at three locations in Chicago, Illinois. In February 1935, it moved along with Free Methodist Headquarters to Winona Lake, Indiana.\nDuring its history, the Free Methodist Publishing House built up a plant and accumulated property worth several hundred thousand dollars. It also contributed thousands of dollars out of its profits to other activities of the church.\nOver the years, as the ministry of the Free Methodist Church expanded, various departments of the general church gradually moved into Free Methodist Publishing House accommodations. This was provided at vast cost and without the investment of any capital by the general church.\nIn 1960, the Free Methodist Publishing House board issued a deed in favor of the general church, whereby the church became the owner of the old property, plus nearly eight acres of land. For this the general church paid nothing, but agreed to make payments of $5,000 per year over a ten-year period to the Free Methodist Publishing House.\nAudio publications.\nIn 1944 the Free Methodist Church began a weekly radio show called The Light and Life Radio Hour which featured hymns, sermons, prayer, and scripture reading. The show ran until 1980 and featured several different hosts over the years including Dr. Leroy Lowell, Myron F. Boyd, and Robert Andrews.\nIn 2016 Josh Avery began The FMC Radio Show which was a spiritual successor to The Light and Life Radio Hour but embodied a very different focus. In a podcast format, the show is subtitled \"your officially unofficial source for all things Free Methodist\". Instead of worship and sermon, the show means to act as a uniting factor in the Free Methodist Church by informing listeners about different things that are happening in the denomination.\nToday, the Light+Life podcast features ministries of the Free Methodist Church that tell their stories of ministry fruitfulness.\nMinistry.\n\"Arnold\u2019s Commentary\" was published from 1894 to 1980. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the church pioneered fully graded church school materials. In 1960 the \"Aldersgate Biblical Series\" was developed as the only inductive curriculum of its time.\nA fully equipped printing area consisting of letterpresses, offset press, cutters, folders, bindery, linotypes etc. contributed toward making the church independent of commercial printers for the production for its printing needs at that time.\nActing on the recommendation of its executive committee, the board voted in 1988 to phase out printing operations. This decision and the 1989 General Conference decision to move the Press and Headquarters from Winona Lake to Indianapolis in 1990 shifted the focus of the Press. Where formerly, the Press produced and published Sunday school curriculum, this venture is now carried on in cooperation with other holiness denominations.\nBeginning in 2008, the Wesleyan Publishing House, publishing arm of the Wesleyan Church, began serving the distribution and customer service needs of Light and Life Press.\nMission statement.\nLight &amp; Life Communications, the official publishing arm of the Free Methodist Church, is a not-for-profit corporation that exists to serve in partnership with its parent body, the Free Methodist Church. Its primary purpose is to publish and distribute materials that enable the church to fulfill its stated mission. Light &amp; Life Communications also offers its services and materials to all who seek to make Christ known."}

{"id": "11246", "revid": "1272385410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11246", "title": "John Falstaff", "text": "Sir John Falstaff is a fictional character who appears in three plays by William Shakespeare and is eulogised in a fourth. His significance as a fully developed character is primarily formed in the plays \"Henry IV, Part 1\" and \"Part 2\", where he is a companion to Prince Hal, the future King Henry V of England. Falstaff is also featured as the buffoonish suitor of two married women in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". Though primarily a comic figure, he embodies a depth common to Shakespeare's major characters. A fat, vain, and boastful knight, he spends most of his time drinking at the Boar's Head Inn with petty criminals, living on stolen or borrowed money. Falstaff leads the apparently wayward Prince Hal into trouble, and is repudiated when Hal becomes king.\nFalstaff has appeared in other works, including operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Otto Nicolai, a \"symphonic study\" by Edward Elgar, and in Orson Welles's 1966 film \"Chimes at Midnight\". The operas focus on his role in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", while the film adapts the Henriad and \"The Merry Wives\". Welles, who played Falstaff in his film, considered the character \"Shakespeare's greatest creation\". The word \"Falstaffian\" has entered the English language with connotations of corpulence, jollity, and debauchery.\nRole in the plays.\nFalstaff appears in three of Shakespeare's plays: \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\", and \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". His death is mentioned in \"Henry V\", but he has no lines, nor is it directed that he appear on stage. However, many stage and film adaptations have seen it necessary to include Falstaff for the insight he provides into King Henry V's character. The most notable examples in cinema are Laurence Olivier's 1944 version and Kenneth Branagh's 1989 film, both of which draw additional material from the \"Henry IV\" plays.\nThe character is known to have been very popular with audiences at the time, and for many years afterwards. According to Leonard Digges, writing shortly after Shakespeare's death, while many plays could not get good audiences, \"let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest, you scarce shall have a room\".\n\"Henry IV, Part 1\".\nKing Henry is troubled by the behaviour of his son and heir, the Prince of Wales. Hal (the future Henry V) has lost his authority at court and spends his time in taverns with low companions. He has become an object of scorn to the nobility and his worthiness to succeed his father is doubted. Hal's main companion in enjoying the low life is Sir John Falstaff. Fat, old, drunk, and corrupt as he is, he has a charisma and a zest for life that captivates the Prince.\nHal likes Falstaff but makes no pretence of being like him. He enjoys insulting his dissolute friend and makes sport of him. He and Poins pretend to go along with a plan by Falstaff and three friends to carry out a highway robbery, but then attack the robbers in disguise and in turn steal their loot, after which Hal returns it to its owner. Hal tells the audience that he will soon abandon this life and assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change will gain him additional approval and earn him respect at court.\nFalstaff, who has \"misused the King's press damnably\", by taking money from able-bodied men who wished to evade service and by keeping the wages of those he recruited who were killed in battle (\"food for powder, food for powder\") is obliged to play a role in the Battle of Shrewsbury. Left on his own during Hal's duel with Hotspur, he feigns death to avoid attack by Douglas. After Hal leaves both Hotspur and Falstaff on the field and being thought dead, Falstaff revives, stabs Hotspur's corpse in the thigh and claims credit for the kill. Though Hal knows better, he is merciful to Falstaff, who subsequently states that he wants to amend his life and begin \"to live cleanly as a nobleman should do\".\n\"Henry IV, Part 2\".\nThe play focuses on Prince Hal's journey toward kingship, and his ultimate rejection of Falstaff. However, unlike \"Part One\", Hal's and Falstaff's stories are almost entirely separate, as the two characters meet only twice and very briefly. The tone of much of the play is elegiac, focusing on Falstaff's age and his closeness to death, which parallels that of the increasingly sick king.\nFalstaff is still drinking and engaging in petty criminality in the London underworld. He first appears, followed by a new character, a young page whom Prince Hal has assigned him as a joke. Falstaff enquires what the doctor has said about the analysis of his urine, and the page cryptically informs him that the urine is healthier than the patient. Falstaff delivers one of his most characteristic lines: \"I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men.\" Falstaff promises to outfit the page in \"vile apparel\" (ragged clothing). He then complains of his insolvency, blaming it on \"consumption of the purse.\" They go off, Falstaff vowing to find a wife \"in the stews\" (i.e., the local brothels).\nThe Lord Chief Justice enters, looking for Falstaff. Falstaff at first feigns deafness in order to avoid conversing with him. When this tactic fails, Falstaff pretends to mistake him for someone else. As the Chief Justice attempts to question Falstaff about a recent robbery, Falstaff insists on turning the subject of the conversation to the nature of the illness afflicting the King. He then adopts the pretense of being a much younger man than the Chief Justice: \"You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young.\" Finally, he asks the Chief Justice for one thousand pounds to help outfit a military expedition, but is denied.\nHe has a relationship with Doll Tearsheet, a prostitute, who gets into a fight with Ancient Pistol, Falstaff's ensign. After Falstaff ejects Pistol, Doll asks him about the Prince. Falstaff is embarrassed when his derogatory remarks are overheard by Hal, who is present disguised as a musician. Falstaff tries to talk his way out of it, but Hal is unconvinced. When news of a second rebellion arrives, Falstaff joins the army again, and goes to the country to raise forces. There he encounters an old school friend, Justice Shallow, and they reminisce about their youthful follies. Shallow brings forward potential recruits for the loyalist army: Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, Shadow and Wart, a motley collection of rustic yokels. Falstaff and his cronies accept bribes from two of them, Mouldy and Bullcalf, not to be conscripted.\nIn the final scene, Falstaff, having learned from Pistol that Hal is now King, travels to London in expectation of great rewards. But Hal rejects him, saying that he has now changed, and can no longer associate with such people. The London lowlifes, expecting a paradise of thieves under Hal's governance, are instead purged and imprisoned by the authorities.\n\"Henry V\".\nAlthough Falstaff does not appear on stage in \"Henry V\", his death is the main subject of Act 2, Scene 3, in which Mistress Quickly delivers a memorable eulogy:\nThere is a similarity in Shakespeare's description of the death of Falstaff, and in Plato's description of the death of Socrates. In a description in Plato's dialogue \"Phaedo\", after Socrates has drunk hemlock, the man who gave him the poisonfelt him, and after an interval examined his feet and legs; he then pinched his foot hard and asked if he would feel it, and Socrates said not. And then he felt his shins once more; and moving upwards in this way, he showed us that he was becoming cold and numb. He went on feeling him and said that when the coldness reached his heart, he would be gone.\n\"The Merry Wives of Windsor\".\nFalstaff arrives in Windsor very short on money. To obtain financial advantage, he decides to court two wealthy married women, Mistress Ford and Mistress Page. Falstaff decides to send the women identical love letters and asks his servants \u2013 Pistol and Nym \u2013 to deliver them to the wives. When they refuse, Falstaff sacks them, and, in revenge, the men tell Ford and Page (the husbands) of Falstaff's intentions. Page is not concerned, but the jealous Ford persuades the Host of the Garter Inn to introduce him to Falstaff as a 'Master Brook' so that he can find out Falstaff's plans.\nWhen the women receive the letters, each goes to tell the other, and they quickly find that the letters are almost identical. The \"merry wives\" are not interested in the ageing, overweight Falstaff as a suitor; however, for the sake of their own amusement and to gain revenge for his indecent assumptions towards them both, they pretend to respond to his advances.\nThis all results in great embarrassment for Falstaff. Mr. Ford poses as 'Mr. Brook' and says he is in love with Mistress Ford but cannot woo her as she is too virtuous. He offers to pay Falstaff to court her, saying that once she has lost her honour he will be able to tempt her himself. Falstaff cannot believe his luck, and tells 'Brook' he has already arranged to meet Mistress Ford while her husband is out. Falstaff leaves to keep his appointment and Ford soliloquises that he is right to suspect his wife and that the trusting Page is a fool.\nWhen Falstaff arrives to meet Mistress Ford, the merry wives trick him into hiding in a laundry basket (\"buck basket\") full of filthy, smelly clothes awaiting laundering. When the jealous Ford returns to try and catch his wife with the knight, the wives have the basket taken away and the contents (including Falstaff) dumped into the river. Although this affects Falstaff's pride, his ego is surprisingly resilient. He is convinced that the wives are just playing hard to get with him, so he continues his pursuit of sexual advancement, with its attendant capital and opportunities for blackmail.\nAgain Falstaff goes to meet the women but Mistress Page comes back and warns Mistress Ford of her husband's approach again. They try to think of ways to hide him other than the laundry basket which he refuses to get into again. They trick him again, this time into disguising himself as Mistress Ford's maid's obese aunt, known as \"the fat woman of Brentford\". Ford tries once again to catch his wife with the knight but ends up beating the \"old woman\", whom he despises, and throwing her out of his house. Black and blue, Falstaff laments his bad luck.\nEventually the wives tell their husbands about the series of jokes they have played on Falstaff, and together they devise one last trick which ends up with the Knight being humiliated in front of the whole town. They tell Falstaff to dress as \"Herne, the Hunter\" and meet them by an old oak tree in Windsor Forest (now part of Windsor Great Park). They then dress several of the local children as fairies and get them to pinch and burn Falstaff to punish him.\nThe wives meet Falstaff, and almost immediately the \"fairies\" attack. After the chaos, the characters reveal their true identities to Falstaff. Although he is embarrassed, Falstaff takes the joke surprisingly well, as he sees it was what he deserved. Ford says he must pay back the 20 pounds 'Brook' gave him and takes the Knight's horses as recompense. Eventually they all leave together and Mistress Page even invites Falstaff to come with them: \"let us every one go home, and laugh this sport o'er by a country fire; Sir John and all\".\nOrigins.\nJohn Oldcastle.\nShakespeare originally named Falstaff \"John Oldcastle\", a real historical personage who died in 1417. Lord Cobham, a descendant of Oldcastle, complained, forcing Shakespeare to change the name. Shakespeare's \"Henry IV\" plays and \"Henry V\" adapted and developed the material in an earlier play called \"The Famous Victories of Henry V\", in which Sir John \"Jockey\" Oldcastle appears as a dissolute companion of the young Henry. Prince Hal refers to Falstaff as \"my old lad of the castle\" in the first act of the play; the epilogue to \"Henry IV, Part 2\", moreover, explicitly disavows any connection between Falstaff and Oldcastle: \"Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man.\"\nThe historical Oldcastle was a knight from Herefordshire who became a Lollard who was executed for heresy and rebellion, and he was respected by many Protestants as a martyr. In addition to the anonymous \"The Famous Victories of Henry V\", in which Oldcastle is Henry V's companion, Oldcastle's history is described in Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicles\", Shakespeare's usual source for his histories.\nCobhams.\nIt is not clear, however, if Shakespeare characterised Falstaff as he did for dramatic purposes, or because of a specific desire to satirise Oldcastle or the Cobhams. Cobham was a common butt of veiled satire in Elizabethan popular literature; he figures in Ben Jonson's \"Every Man in His Humour\" and may have been part of the reason \"The Isle of Dogs\" was suppressed. Shakespeare's desire to burlesque a hero of early English Protestantism could indicate Roman Catholic sympathies, but Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham was sufficiently sympathetic to Catholicism that in 1603, he was imprisoned as part of the Main Plot to place Arbella Stuart on the English throne, so if Shakespeare wished to use Oldcastle to embarrass the Cobhams, he seems unlikely to have done so on religious grounds.\nThe Cobhams appear to have intervened while Shakespeare was in the process of writing either \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" or the second part of \"Henry IV\". The first part of \"Henry IV\" was probably written and performed in 1596, and the name Oldcastle had almost certainly been allowed by Master of the Revels Edmund Tilney. William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham may have become aware of the offensive representation after a public performance; he may also have learned of it while it was being prepared for a court performance (Cobham was at that time Lord Chamberlain). As father-in-law to the newly widowed Robert Cecil, Cobham certainly possessed the influence at court to get his complaint heard quickly. Shakespeare may have included a sly retaliation against the complaint in his play \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" (published after the \"Henry IV\" series). In the play, the paranoid, jealous Master Ford uses the alias \"Brook\" to fool Falstaff, perhaps in reference to William Brooke. At any rate, the name is Falstaff in the \"Henry IV, Part 1\" quarto, of 1598, and the epilogue to the second part, published in 1600, contains this clarification:\nSir John Fastolf.\nThe new name \"Falstaff\" probably derived from the medieval knight Sir John Fastolf. The historical Fastolf fought at the Battle of Patay against Joan of Arc, which the English lost. His previous career as a soldier had earned him wide respect but he seems to have become a scapegoat after the debacle. He was among the few English military leaders to avoid death or capture during the battle, and although there is no evidence that he acted with cowardice, he was temporarily stripped of his knighthood. Fastolf appears in \"Henry VI, Part 1\" in which he is portrayed as an abject coward. In the\" First Folio \"his name is spelled \"Falstaffe\", so Shakespeare may have directly appropriated the spelling of the name he used in the earlier play.\nRobert Greene.\nIt has been suggested that the dissolute writer Robert Greene may also have been an inspiration for the character of Falstaff. This theory was first proposed in 1930 and has been championed by Stephen Greenblatt. Notorious for a life of dissipation and debauchery somewhat similar to Falstaff, he was among the first to mention Shakespeare in his work (in \"Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit\"), suggesting to Greenblatt that the older writer may have influenced Shakespeare's characterisation.\nCultural adaptations.\nThere are several works about Falstaff, inspired by Shakespeare's plays:\nReferences.\nNotes\nSources\nFurther reading"}
{"id": "11247", "revid": "24036618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11247", "title": "Floorball", "text": "Floorball (also known by other names) is a sport played with five players and a goalkeeper in each team. It is played indoors with sticks and a hollow plastic ball with holes. Matches are played in three periods. The sport of bandy also played a role in the game's development.\nThe game was invented in Sweden in the late 1960s. The basic rules were established in 1979 when the first floorball club in the world, Sala IBK, from Sala, was founded in Sweden. Official rules for matches were first written down in 1981.\nThe sport is organized internationally by the International Floorball Federation (IFF). As of 2019, there were about 377,000 registered floorball players worldwide, up from around 300,000 in 2014. Events include an annual Champions Cup, EuroFloorball Cup and EuroFloorball Challenge for club teams and the biennial World Floorball Championships with separate divisions for men and women. Men's semi-professional club leagues include Finland's F-liiga, Sweden's Svenska Superligan, Switzerland's Unihockey Prime League, and the Czech Republic's Superliga florbalu. Women's semi-professional leagues from the same countries are F-liiga, Svenska Superligan, Unihockey Prime League and Extraliga \u017een.\nWhile the IFF contains 80 members, floorball is most popular where it has been developed the longest, such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. It is gaining popularity in Australia, New Zealand, India, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nFloorball was included in the World Games for the first time in 2017 in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland, where Sweden became the first team to win a gold medal.\nEtymology.\nThe game of floorball is also known by many other names, such as (in Estonia), (in Finland), (in Sweden and Norway), unihockey (in Switzerland and Ireland), unihokej (in Poland), Unihockey (in Germany) and (in Lithuania). The names and are derived from \"bandy\" and translate to \"hall bandy\" and \"indoor bandy\" respectively. In Sweden, voices have been raised to get rid of the word as name of the sport, to avoid confusions with bandy. The name \"unihockey\" is shortened from \"universal hockey\" since it is meant to be a special and simplified hockey form.\nHistory.\nIn various forms the game of floor hockey has been played since the early 20th Century in Canada as a recreational sport, especially in high school gymnasiums, as a playful variant of hockey. The basic design of floorball sticks is believed to have come from the ice skating team sport of bandy.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s many public school systems within Michigan in the United States incorporated floorball into their primary and secondary school gym classes. Americans have since claimed to have invented floorball. America held interstate tournaments in the 1960s.\nFloorball was formally organized as an international and more organized sport in the late 1970s in Gothenburg, Sweden. The sport began as something that was played for fun as a pastime in schools. After a decade or so, floorball began showing up in Nordic countries where the former schoolyard pastime was becoming a developed sport. Formal rules were soon developed, and clubs began to form. After some time, several countries developed national associations, and the IFF was founded in 1986.\nExpansion.\nWhen the IFF was founded in 1986, the sport was played mostly in the Nordic countries, several parts of the rest of Europe and Japan. By 1990, floorball was recognized in 7 countries, and by the time of the first European Floorball Championships in 1994, the number had risen to 14. That number included the United States, who was the first country outside Europe and Asia to recognize floorball. By the time of the first men's world championships in 1996, 20 nations played floorball, with 12 of them participating at the tournament.\nCurrently the IFF has 80 members, in addition to recognizing 11 other countries with ongoing floorball development. Of its members, 58 have national floorball associations that are recognized by the IFF. With the addition of Sierra Leone, Africa's first floorball nation, the IFF has at least one national association on each continent of the world, with the exception of Antarctica.\nDevelopment.\n10 years after the IFF was founded, the first world championships were played, with a sold out final of 15,106 people at the Globen in Stockholm, Sweden. In addition to that, the world's two largest floorball leagues, Finland's Salibandyliiga and Sweden's Svenska Superligan were formed, in 1986 and 1995 respectively.\nRecognition.\nIn December 2008, the IFF and the sport of floorball received recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In July 2011, the IOC officially welcomed the IFF into its family of Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF). This will pave the way for floorball to enter the official sport programme. The IFF hoped that this recognition would help allow floorball to become a part of the 2020 Summer Olympics. As of 2024, the IOC has not announced any plans to add floorball to future Olympic games.\nIn January 2009, the IFF and the sport of floorball received recognition from the Special Olympics.\nIn addition to recognition by the IOC and Special Olympics, the IFF is also a member of the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF, formerly SportAccord), and co-operates with the International University Sports Federation (FISU). Floorball is now also member of IWGA, which runs the World Games, and floorball was on the programme for the first time in Wroc\u0142aw 2017.\nWorld championships.\nThe world floorball championships is annual event, but each class only meet every other year\u2014the men and women under 19 meet in even years, and the women and men under 19 meet in odd years. The Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland remain the only five countries to have ever captured a medal at a World Championship event.\nFrom 1996 to 2009, the IFF used a World Floorball Championship format where the last team in the A-Division was relegated to the B-Division, while the top team in the B-Division was promoted to the A-Division. This format caused much hardship for countries such as Australia, Canada, Slovakia, and Spain, who have all been trying to get to the B-Division from the C-Division since 2004. In 2010, the IFF adopted a FIFA-like continental qualification system, where teams must qualify to play at the world championships. Depending on the number of countries registered per continent or region, the IFF gives spots for the world championships. For example, Argentina, Brazil, Canada and the United States would need to play for one spot at the world championships in a continental qualification tournament for the Americas.\nGameplay.\nMeasurements.\nFloorball is played indoors on a rink whose size can officially vary from wide to long, and which is surrounded by high enclosed boards with rounded corners. The goals are wide and high. Their depth is and they are from the end of the nearest boards. Face-off dots are marked on the center line. Dots are also marked from both sides of the rink on the goal lines imaginary extensions. The dots do not exceed in diameter. They do not have to be dots, they can also be crosses.\nEquipment.\nTypical equipment for a floorball player consists of a stick, a pair of shorts, a shirt, socks, and indoor sport shoes. Players may wear shin guards, eye protectors and protective padding for vital areas although most do not. Protective eyewear is, in some countries, compulsory for junior players.\nA floorball stick is short compared with one for ice hockey; the maximum size for a stick is . As a stick cannot weigh any more than , floorball sticks are often made of carbon and composite materials. The blade of the stick can either be \"right\" or \"left\" which indicates which way stick is supposed to be held from the player's point of view. A player who is right-handed will often use a \"left\" blade since they will be holding the stick to right, and the other way around for left-handed people.\nGoalkeepers.\nGoalkeepers wear limited protection provided by padded pants, a padded chest protector, knee pads and a helmet. Some goalkeepers like to wear gloves and/or wristbands The goalkeeper may also wear other protective equipment such as elbow pads and jock straps but bulky padding is not permitted. Goalkeepers do not use sticks and may use their hands to play the ball when they are within the goalkeeper's box. There, they are allowed to throw the ball out to their teammates provided that the ball touches the ground before the half court mark. They can assist but not score. When they are completely outside the box, goalkeepers are considered field players and are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands.\nBall.\nA floor ball weighs and its diameter is . It has 26 holes in it, each of which are in diameter. Many of these balls now are made with aerodynamic technology, where the ball has over a thousand small dimples in it that reduce air resistance. There have been several times where a ball has been recorded to have traveled at a speed of approximately .\nForms.\n3v3.\nThis modality works almost the same as the normal 5v5 one, but with only 3 field players per team. Goalkeepers have a bag full of balls behind the goal, and they will play one if the current ball goes out the field. They can score directly if the ball bounces before the midfield line. Game time is divided in 2 parts of 10 minutes each with semi-effective time (only stops on goals or interruptions led by the referee) and a 2-minute break.\nFirst 3vs3 World Floorball Championships were celebrated in Lahti (11-12 May 2024) with Finland winning the female tournament and Latvia doing the same in the male category. This WFC format is expected to be celebrated each year.\nFreebandy.\nFreebandy is a sport that developed in the 2000s from floorball fanatics who specialize in a technique called \"zorro\", which involves lifting the ball onto a stick and allowing air resistance and fast movements to keep the ball \"stuck\" to the stick. This technique is also referred to as \"airhooking\" or \"skyhooking\". In freebandy, the rules are very much the same of those of floorball, with the exception of high nets and no infractions for high sticking. As well, the sticks are slightly tweaked from those of a floorball variety to include a \"pocket\" where the ball can be placed.\nSpecial Olympics.\nFloorball at the Special Olympics is slightly modified from the \"regular\" form of floorball. Matches are played 3-on-3 with a goaltender, on a smaller court that measures long by wide. This form of floorball was developed for the intellectually disabled, and has yet to be played at the Special Olympics. Floorball was played as a demonstration sport at the 2013 Special Olympics World Winter Games, and was played as an official sport at the games in 2017.\nStreetbandy.\nA simplified less formal version of floorball, played with smaller team numbers and shorter periods, and typically outdoors on various surfaces, including AstroTurf. In its most basic form, it is an informal pick up game amongst friends. However, a more formal version is played in Sweden, with the following structure:\nSwiss floorball.\nSwiss floorball called unihockey is a revised version of a floorball match. The match is played on a slightly smaller court and often involves only three field players playing on each side, in 3-on-3 floorball. This form of floorball is also slightly shorter, with only two periods of 15 to 20 minutes each played. In Switzerland this form of playing is called \"smallcourt\" (Kleinfeld), opposed to the usual style of playing on a bigger court, which is called \"bigcourt\" (Grossfeld).\nWheelchair floorball.\nOriginally developed for players with disabilities, wheelchair floorball is played with exactly the same rules as \"regular\" floorball. Players use the same stick and ball, and goaltenders are also allowed to play.\nThe first ever IFF-sanctioned wheelchair floorball matches were played between the men's teams of the Czech Republic and Sweden during the 2008 Men's World Floorball Championships in Prague.\nIn addition to this, there is also an electric wheelchair variation.\nRules.\nEach team can field six players at a time on the court, one player being a goalkeeper. But the coach can take the goalkeeper off and substitute them for a field player whenever they like, although it usually only happens in the end to increase the chances of scoring with one more outfield player. This can bring an advantage for the attacking side of the team but also disadvantages when it comes to their own defense. Both teams are also allowed to change players any time in the game; usually, a change comprises the whole team. Individual substitution happens sometimes, but usually only when a player is exhausted or hurt.\nA floorball game is officially played over three periods lasting 20 minutes each (15 minutes for juniors). The clock is stopped in the case of penalties, goals, time-outs and any situation where the ball is not considered to be in play. The signal of a timeout is a triple honking sound. An intermission of 10 minutes (or maximum 15 minutes in some competitions) takes place between each period, where teams change ends and substitution areas. Each team is allowed one timeout of 30 seconds, which is often used late in matches. There are two referees to oversee the game, each with equal authority. If a game ends in a tie, teams play ten minutes extra, and the team that scores first wins. If the game is still drawn after extra-time, a penalty shootout similar to ice-hockey decides the winner.\nChecking is prohibited in floorball. Controlled shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed but ice hockey-like checking is forbidden. Pushing players without the ball or competing for a loose ball is also disallowed, and many of these infractions lead to two-minute penalties. The best comparison in terms of legal physical contact is Association football (soccer), where checking is used to improve one's positioning in relation to the ball rather than to remove an opposing player from the play. In addition to checking, players cannot lift an opponent's stick or perform any stick infractions in order to get to the ball. Moreover, players may not raise their stick or play the ball above knee level, and a stick may not be placed in between a player's legs. Passing the ball by foot is allowed more than once, following a rule change from 2022. Passing by hand or head deliberately may result in a two minutes penalty for the offending player. A field player may not enter the marked goal area and playing without stick is prohibited.\nWhen a player commits a foul or when the ball is deemed unplayable, play is resumed from a free hit or a face-off. A free hit means that a player from one of the teams restarts the play from the place where the ball was last deemed unplayable. A comparable situation to this is a free kick in association football. For many fouls, such as stick infractions, a free hit is the only disciplinary action prescribed. However, at their own discretion the referee may additionally award a two or five minute penalty to the offending player. In that case, the player who committed the foul has to leave the field and sit out his punishment in a dedicated penalty area, leaving his team shorthanded for the time of the penalty. If an 'extreme' foul is committed, such as physical contact or unsportsmanlike conduct, a player may receive a 10-minute personal penalty.\nPenalties.\nTwo-minute penalties can arise from a number of infractions and result in the offending player being sat on a penalty seat next to the scorers/timekeepers and away from the team benches. Each penalty has a specific code that is recorded on the official match record along with the time of the foul. The team of the offending player will play short-handed for the full length of the penalty. The codes are as follows;\nTwo Minute Penalties\n2+2 Minute Penalties\nPersonal Fouls/Penalties\nMatch Penalties\nCompetitions.\nIn addition to the Floorball World Championships, there are other IFF Events for club teams such as the Champions Cup which is for the national competition winners from the Top-4 ranked nations, and the EuroFloorball Cup for the national competition winners from the 5th and lower ranked nations. There are also many international floorball club competitions.\nAsia Pacific Floorball Championship.\nThe Asia Pacific Floorball Championships are played every single year in New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, or Japan. The event was created by the Singapore Floorball Association together with the cooperation of the Asia Oceania Floorball Confederation (AOFC). Members of the AOFC get together during this tournament to play for the Asia Pacific Floorball Championship every year.\nAs of 2010, the Asia Pacific Floorball Championship is also the qualifying tournament for the World Floorball Championships.\nCanada Cup.\nThe Canada Cup is an international club tournament that is held every year in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the largest floorball club tournament outside of Europe, and attracts 55+ clubs from worldwide, every year.\nCzech Open.\nThe world's largest club team tournament, the Czech Open is a traditional summer tournament held in Prague, Czech Republic. It is famous not only for its on-court activities, but also for those off-court. The tournament attracts 200+ clubs every year from 20 countries.\nChampions Cup.\nThe Champions Cup was played for the first time in 2011. It is now the premier IFF event for Men's and Women's Club teams. The national championship winners from the Top-4 ranked nations compete in the event.\nEuroFloorball Cup.\nThe EuroFloorball Cup (formerly European Cup) is an IFF-organised club event for both men's and women's teams. It has taken place every single year since 1993, and in 2000 it changed its format to a 2-year event (i.e. 2000\u201301). In 2008, the tournament switched back to its one-year format. In 2011 it underwent another change when the Champions Cup was introduced for the first time.\nThe EuroFloorball Cup (EFC) is now for the national competition winners from the 5th and lower ranked nations. Qualification can be made via a number of processes. Firstly, the teams from the 5th, 6th &amp; 7th ranked nations receive automatic qualification. A team nominated by the local event organiser also gets automatic qualification, and then the last two spots are determined by qualification tournaments.\nNorth American Floorball League.\nThe North American Floorball League is the first and only semi professional floorball league outside of Europe. It is not affiliated with any federation, so it has players from around the world. The inaugural set of teams are entirely based in the United States, though there is potential for expansion into Canada."}
{"id": "11250", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11250", "title": "Premier League", "text": "The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away. Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.\nThe competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20\u00a0February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams are still relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship at the conclusion of each season. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders. The Premier League takes advantage of a \u00a35\u00a0billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively. This deal will rise to \u00a36.7\u00a0billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029. The league is projected to earn $7.2\u00a0billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025. Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of \u00a32.4\u00a0billion in 2016\u201317, with a further \u00a3343\u00a0million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.\nThe Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643\u00a0million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7\u00a0billion people. For the 2023\u201324 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375, second to the German Bundesliga's 39,512, whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league. Most stadium occupancies are near capacity. , the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La\u00a0Liga. The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European cups in total.\nFifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1). Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nDespite major European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the mid-to-late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were ageing with poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs faced a 5-year ban from European competition following the events of the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster. The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.\nBy the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster (between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989) was published in January 1990.\nDuring the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation. The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986. They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches, and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received \u00a36.3\u00a0million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to \u00a344\u00a0million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash. According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around \u00a325,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around \u00a350,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to \u00a3600,000 in 1988. The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal. The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\". By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.\nIn 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner. The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money. The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position. The FA released a report in June 1991, \"Blueprint for the Future of Football\", that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.\nFounding and Manchester United dominance (1990s).\nAt the close of the 1990\u20131991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of \u00a3304\u00a0million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on \"Match of the Day\".\nLuton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991\u201392 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division. The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate. The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:\nThis meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.\nThe league held its first season in 1992\u201393. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995\u201396 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2\u20131 win against Manchester United.\nManchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition's dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup 'doubles' and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy.\nBetween 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United's early dominance, both of whom housed Alan Shearer up front. Blackburn won the 1994\u201395 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995\u201396 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United's dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997\u201398, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003.\nEmergence of the \"Big Four\" (2000s).\nThe 2000s saw Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United dominate the Premier League, forming the so-called \"Big Four\". Manchester United won five league titles (1999\u20132000, 2000\u201301, 2002\u201303, 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308), Arsenal claimed two (2001\u201302, 2003\u201304), while Chelsea rose to prominence with three under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2009\u201310). Arsenal\u2019s unbeaten 2003\u201304 season earned them the nickname \"The Invincibles,\" the only team to achieve this in the Premier League era. Only three other clubs secured a top-four finish during the decade: Newcastle United (2001\u201302, 2002\u201303), Everton (2004\u201305), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009\u201310). However, the Big Four consistently dominated the top spots, with three of them finishing in the top four every season from 1999\u20132000 to 2009\u201310.\nPremier League clubs were also highly competitive in Europe. Between 2005 and 2012, an English side reached seven of eight Champions League finals, with Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) winning. Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009, 2011) finished as runners-up. Leeds United were the only non-Big Four side to reach the semi-finals, doing so in 2000\u201301. Three English clubs made the semi-finals in 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308, and 2008\u201309\u2014a feat only matched twice by other leagues.\nIn the UEFA Cup/Europa League, four Premier League teams reached the final between 2000 and 2010, with only Liverpool lifting the trophy in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all fell short.\nThe decade saw record-breaking points tallies, including Chelsea\u2019s 95-point haul in 2004\u201305 and Manchester United\u2019s three consecutive title wins (2006\u201307 to 2008\u201309). The rise of billionaire owners, including Roman Abramovich at Chelsea and Sheikh Mansour at Manchester City (2008), began reshaping the league\u2019s financial landscape, setting the stage for a more competitive 2010s.\nEmergence of the \"Big Six\" (2010s).\nAfter 2009, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City regularly broke into the top four, forming a \"Big Six\". In 2009\u201310, Tottenham finished fourth, the first new club to do so since Everton five years earlier.\nDespite growing competition, criticism remains over the financial gap between elite clubs and the rest of the league. Manchester City's 2011\u201312 title win was the first by a club outside the \"Big Four\" since Blackburn Rovers in 1994\u201395. That season also saw Chelsea and Liverpool finish outside the top four for the first time since 1994\u201395.\nWith only four UEFA Champions League spots available, competition among the \"Big Six\" intensified. In the five seasons after 2011\u201312, Manchester United and Liverpool missed the top four three times, and Chelsea finished 10th in 2015\u201316. Arsenal\u2019s 2016\u201317 fifth-place finish ended their 20-year top-four streak.\nIn 2015\u201316, Leicester City defied 5000/1 odds to win the league, becoming the first non-\"Big Six\" champion since Blackburn in 1994\u201395.\nFinancially, the \"Big Six\" hold outsized influence, arguing for a greater revenue share due to their global status and style of play. Critics argue that the league's egalitarian revenue model ensures long-term competitiveness. The 2016\u201317 Deloitte Football Money League highlighted the revenue gap. The \"Big Six\" each earned over \u20ac350\u00a0million, with Manchester United leading at \u20ac676.3\u00a0million. Leicester City was closest, with \u20ac271.1\u00a0million, boosted by Champions League participation. West Ham, eighth in revenue (\u20ac213.3\u00a0million), earned less than half of fifth-place Liverpool (\u20ac424.2\u00a0million).\nTV broadcast deals accounted for a large portion of club revenues, with the top clubs earning between \u00a3150\u00a0million and nearly \u00a3200\u00a0million in 2016\u201317. By 2019, all \"Big Six\" clubs ranked in the world\u2019s top ten richest.\nLiverpool and Manchester City dominance (2020s).\nFrom the 2019\u201320 season, video assistant referees were used in the league. The 2019\u201320 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.\nProject Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by Manchester United and Liverpool. It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\nOn 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow Muslim players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.\nThe 2022\u201323 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup, with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures. The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected \"significant moments\". They assured to \"remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice\". That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion breaking the traditional \"Big Six\" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst \"Big Six\" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth. Meanwhile, 2015\u201316 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011\u201312 season.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history. Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024\u201325 UEFA Champions League.\nCorporate structure.\nThe Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.\nThe current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019. The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.\nThe Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023\u201324 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.\nCriticism of governance.\nThe Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability.\nFollowing the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process. On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes \u2013 to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator \u2013 but without the same systems for accountability.\"\nOn 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP \u2013 chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance \u2013 announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.\nPremier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don't think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"\nCompetition format.\nCompetition.\nThere are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.\nPromotion and relegation.\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League, with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs. The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991\u201392 season \u2013 the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.\nOn 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007\u201308 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction. Ultimately, the 2007\u201308 season kicked off again with 20 teams.\nVideo Assistant Referee.\nVideo assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019\u201320 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch. However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making.\nThe on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds.\nA study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data. The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology's impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns.\nClubs.\nFifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023\u201324 season.\nChampions.\n\"Italics\" indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League.\n2024\u201325 season.\nTwenty clubs are competing in the 2024\u201325 season \u2013 top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship.\nNon-English clubs.\nIn 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time. The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011. The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013\u201314, as Cardiff City gained promotion, but they were relegated after their maiden season. Cardiff were promoted again in 2017\u201318 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018\u201319 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017\u201318. Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018\u201319 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.\nBecause they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013\u201314 by winning the League Cup in 2012\u201313. The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.\nParticipation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland. Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.\nInternational competitions.\nQualification for European competitions.\nQualification criteria for 2024\u201325.\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024\u201325 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League.\nThe fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season's Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.\nThe number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain.\nAs of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):\nPrevious seasons.\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea \u2013 who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league \u2013 qualified for the 2012\u201313 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.\nFrom 2015\u201316, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five. This took effect in England in 2016\u201317, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017\u201318. In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League.\nPerformance in international competition.\nWith 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively. In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals. In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists. In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively. In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far. In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether. In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively. Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the \"Club World Championship\". They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times. English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.\nSponsorship.\nAfter an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004\u201305 season.\nFor the 2007\u201308 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.\nBarclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015\u201316 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.\nAs well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers. The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000\u201301 season when they took over from Mitre. Under its \"Merlin\" brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards. Launched in the 2007\u201308 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world. In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019\u201320 season. The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017\u201318 season to 2019\u201320 season. The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020\u201321 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021\u201322 season.\nFinances.\nThe Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of \u20ac2.48\u00a0billion in 2009\u201310. In 2013\u201314, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of \u00a378\u00a0million, exceeding all other football leagues. In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.\nThe Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009\u201310 season, and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013\u201314 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue. In 2019, the league generated around \u00a33.1\u00a0billion per year in domestic and international television rights.\nPremier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.\nCentral payments for the 2016\u201317 season amounted to \u00a32,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of \u00a335,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (\u00a31,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, \u00a31,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and \u00a339,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of \u00a34,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position. The merit component was a nominal sum of \u00a31,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 \u00d7 \u00a31,941,609 = \u00a39,708,045 merit payment).\nRelegation.\nSince its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.\nPromoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001\u201302, 2011\u201312, 2017\u201318 &amp; 2022\u201323 seasons. In the 1997\u201398 and 2023\u201324 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.\nThe Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives \u00a341\u00a0million whilst the average Championship club receives \u00a32\u00a0million. Starting with the 2013\u201314 season, these payments are in excess of \u00a360\u00a0million over four seasons. Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation.\nClubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.\nMedia coverage.\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland.\nTelevision has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.\nThe Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs. The money is divided into three parts: half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.\nNot all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45\u00a0p.m. and 5:15\u00a0p.m. on Saturday matchdays.\nThe first Sky television rights agreement was worth \u00a3304\u00a0million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997\u201398 season, rose to \u00a3670\u00a0million over four seasons. The third contract was a \u00a31.024\u00a0billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in \u00a3320\u00a0million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid \u00a31.7\u00a0billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3\u00a0pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on \"Match of the Day\") for \u00a3171.6\u00a0million, a 63\u00a0per\u00a0cent increase on the \u00a3105\u00a0million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay \u00a384.3\u00a0million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10\u00a0p.m. on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched \u00a3625\u00a0million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from those deals was more than \u00a32.7\u00a0billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around \u00a340\u00a0million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.\nThe TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result. An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position. In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.\nThe BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016. Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for \u00a31.782\u00a0billion. On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a \u00a330\u00a0million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009\u201310 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013. On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316 seasons at \u00a3246\u00a0million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid \u00a3760\u00a0million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised \u00a33.018\u00a0billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010\u201311 to 2012\u201313 rights. The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid \u00a35.136\u00a0billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018\u201319 season.\nA new rights cycle began in the 2019\u201320 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at \u00a34.464\u00a0billion. In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures. The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.\nWith the resumption of play in the 2019\u201320 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC \u2013 for the first time in league history \u2013 carrying four live matches.\nAs matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020\u201321 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October. It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of \u00a314.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising \u00a320,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising \u00a334,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.\nThe next cycle of rights between 2022\u201323 and 2024\u201325 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019\u201320 season.\nUK highlights\nIn August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled \"The Premier League Show\".\nWorldwide.\nThe Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643\u00a0million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7\u00a0billion people. The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners. On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026\u201327.\nThe Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia. In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports. In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League. In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021\u201322 season. SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights). As of the 2022\u201323 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV, after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.\nThe Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast. Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage. NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021\u201322 season in a deal valued at $1\u00a0billion (\u00a3640\u00a0million). In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76\u00a0billion (\u00a32\u00a0billion).\nThe Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa. Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France, Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria, Match TV for Russia, Sky Sport Italy for Italy, Eleven Sports for Portugal, DAZN for Spain, beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey, Digi Sport for Romania, and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway), Poland and the Netherlands. In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent, with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4. Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.\nStadiums.\nAs of the 2023\u201324 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater. Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums. Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023\u201324 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023\u201324 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350.\nStadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs. For the 2022\u201323 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.&lt;ref name=\"2022/23 Attendance\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League's first season (1992\u201393). However, during the 1992\u201393 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994\u201395 deadline for all-seater stadiums. The 2022\u201323 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15\u00a0million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021\u201322 season, which in turn broke an over 70-year-old record set in the 1948\u201349 season.\nIn October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.\nManagers.\nManagers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (\"i.e.\", more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r at Manchester United.\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017\u201318 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.\nNotably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager.\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.\nPlayers.\nTransfer regulations and foreign players.\nPlayer transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010\u201311 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".\nAt the inception of the Premier League in 1992\u201393, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland. By 2000\u201301, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004\u201305 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up, and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match. By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English. By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.\nIn 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union. A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75\u00a0per\u00a0cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.\nFollowing the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.\nTop scorers.\nThe Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260. Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark. Since the first Premier League season in 1992\u201393, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title. Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005\u201306 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023. Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league. Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.\nWages.\nThere is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was \u00a375,000 per year. In the 2018\u201319 season the average annual salary stood at \u00a32.99\u00a0million.\nThe total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018\u201319 season was \u00a31.62\u00a0billion; this compares to \u00a31.05\u00a0billion in La Liga, \u00a30.83\u00a0billion in Serie A, \u00a30.72\u00a0billion in Bundesliga, and \u00a30.54\u00a0billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at \u00a36.5\u00a0million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona \u00a310.5\u00a0million) and Italy (Juventus \u00a36.7\u00a0million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich \u00a36.4\u00a0million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain \u00a36.1\u00a0million). For the 2018\u201319 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.\nPlayer transfer fees.\nThe record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than \u00a33\u00a0million. The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at \u00a3106.8\u00a0million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at \u00a3105\u00a0million.\nAwards.\nTrophy.\nThe Premier League maintains two trophies \u2013 the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League. In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.\nThe current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard &amp; Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard &amp; Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs and the trophy weighs . The trophy and plinth are tall, wide and deep.\nIts main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy \u2013 the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.\nPlayer and manager awards.\nIn addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season.\nA man-of-the-match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match.\nMonthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month. These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season, Player of the Season and Goal of the Season. The Young Player of the Season award is given to the most outstanding U-23 player starting from the 2019\u201320 season.\nThe Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, the Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who makes the most assists of every season, and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season.\nStarting with the 2021\u201322 season, four new awards are given. The Save of the Season is awarded to the goalkeeper deemed to have made the most impressive save. The Game Changer of the Season is earned by the player with the single most game-changing performance over the course of the campaign. The Most Powerful Goal is given to the player whose goal-scoring shot had the highest average velocity from the time it was struck to the time it crossed the goal line, and the Most Improbable Comeback award is meant for the team that, based on calculations performed by Oracle Corporation, goes behind and overcomes a deficit to win their respective match.\nFrom the 2017\u201318 season, players receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones is to receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement.\n20 Seasons Awards.\nIn 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards:\nReferences.\nBibliography"}
{"id": "11252", "revid": "42119907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11252", "title": "Fine Gael", "text": "Fine Gael ( ; ; ) is a centre to centre-right, liberal-conservative, Christian democratic political party in Ireland. Fine Gael is currently the third-largest party in the Republic of Ireland in terms of members of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The party had a membership of 25,000 in 2021. Simon Harris succeeded Leo Varadkar as party leader on 24 March 2024.\nFine Gael was founded on 8 September 1933, following the merger of its parent party Cumann na nGaedheal, the National Centre Party and the Blueshirts. Its origins lie in the struggle for Irish independence and the pro-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War, with the party claiming the legacy of Michael Collins. In its early years, the party was commonly known as \"Fine Gael \u2013 The United Ireland Party\", abbreviated \"UIP\", and its official title in its constitution remains Fine Gael (United Ireland).\nFine Gael holds a pro-European stance and is generally considered to be more of a proponent of economic liberalism than its traditional rival, Fianna F\u00e1il. Fine Gael describes itself as a \"party of the progressive centre\" which it defines as acting \"in a way that is right for Ireland, regardless of dogma or ideology\". It lists its core values as \"equality of opportunity, free enterprise and reward, security, integrity and hope.\" In international politics, the party is highly supportive of the European Union, along with generally supporting strengthened relations with the United Kingdom and opposition to physical force Irish republicanism. The party's autonomous youth wing, Young Fine Gael (YFG), was formed in 1977.\nFine Gael governed in coalition with the Labour Party between 2011 and 2016, and in a minority government along with independent TDs from 2016 to 2020. It formed part of a historic coalition government with its traditional rival, Fianna F\u00e1il, and the Green Party, with Simon Harris serving as Taoiseach until January 2025. Since January 2025, Fine Gael has been in a coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il and independents, with Simon Harris serving as T\u00e1naiste.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nFine Gael was created in 1933 following the merger of three political organisations; Cumann na nGaedhael (CnaG) led by W. T. Cosgrave, the National Centre Party led by Frank MacDermot and James Dillon, and the National Guard (better known as the Blueshirts), led by Eoin O'Duffy. Cumann na nGaedhael, born out of the pro-Anglo-Irish Treaty side in the Irish Civil War, had been the party of government from the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 until the 1932 general election, which it lost to the newly emergent Fianna F\u00e1il. The National Centre Party was a new party that had done well at the 1932 election, and represented the interests of farmers. The National Guard were not a political party, but a militant group made up of former pro-Treaty Irish Army soldiers, and was previously known as the Army Comrades Association. Following the disruption of Cumann na nGaedhael meetings by members of the Irish Republican Army, the ACA had begun providing security at their events. This led to the leadership of the ACA being taken over by a number of CnaG TDs, including Thomas F. O'Higgins. In early 1933, Eoin O'Duffy took over the ACA, renamed them the National Guard, and began instilling the organisation with elements of European fascism. However, in August 1933 the Fianna F\u00e1il government banned the National Guard, fearing a planned parade in Dublin might be an attempt to emulate the March on Rome, which saw Benito Mussolini rise to power in Italy.\nIn September 1933, the three groups combined forces and merged to form Fine Gael. The National Guard (referred to informally by this point as \"the Blueshirts\") were to serve as the youth wing of the new party, \"The League of Youth\". CnaG members dominated the new party. However, to avoid the perception that Fine Gael was simply Cumann na nGaedhael under a new name, O'Duffy was made leader of the new party. Following poor results at the 1934 local elections and concerns over his increasingly rabid rhetoric, O'Duffy resigned from the leadership after the party attempted to control what he said in public. He was replaced by W. T. Cosgrave, with James Dillon becoming deputy leader. O'Duffy attempted to regain control of the Blueshirts, but was rebuffed by the majority of them, who chose to stay with Fine Gael. Under the stewardship of Cosgrave and Dillon, the party returned to the more traditional conservatism espoused by Cumann na nGaedhael, with the moribund League of Youth disbanded by 1936.\nFinding success with coalitions with Labour.\nFine Gael remained out of government and at a low ebb for a prolonged period until the aftermath of the 1948 general election, which saw the party form a grand coalition with several other parties in order to oust Fianna F\u00e1il and place Fine Gael member John A. Costello as Taoiseach. The coalition was short-lived but revived again between 1954 and 1957. However, following this stint Fine Gael returned to opposition for 16 years. The party went through a period of soul-searching during the 1960s, in which a new generation of Fine Gael politicians led by Declan Costello sought to revitalise Fine Gael with new ideas. In what has later been hailed as a landmark moment in Fine Gael history, Costello proposed moving the party to the left in a social democratic direction with a document entitled \"Towards a Just Society\". The document was adopted as the basis for the party's manifesto for the 1965 general election; however, when the party failed to make headway at the polls the momentum behind the Just Society document wilted and faded.\nIt was not until leader Liam Cosgrave secured an election pact with the Labour Party that Fine Gael returned to government in 1973. This period also saw Fine Gael becoming increasingly liberal in ethos, particularly under the leadership of Garret FitzGerald who took the reins of the party in 1977; It was during this time that Fine Gael campaigned in a number of referendums: the party supported Irish entry into the European Economic Community, supported lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, and supported a proposal to remove the \"special position\" of the Roman Catholic Church from the constitution. It was on the successful side in all three of these campaigns. The party also began to take a more liberal approach to the introduction of contraceptives to Ireland, although an attempt by the Fine Gael/Labour coalition to legalise contraceptives in 1974 stumbled after six members of Fine Gael, most prominently Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave, voted against the government's own bill.\nThe arrangement between Fine Gael and Labour proved pleasing to both parties and their election pacts remained throughout the rest of the 1970s and into the 1980s, seeing the pair enter government a number of times together. In 1985, Fine Gael/Labour voted to liberalise access to contraceptives. That same year FitzGerald signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement with Margaret Thatcher, paving the way to devolved government in Northern Ireland. In 1986 the party campaigned for a Yes in that year's referendum on legalising divorce, which was defeated, with the No side obtaining 63.5% of the vote.\nDecline and rebuilding.\nThe 1980s had proven fruitful electorally for Fine Gael, but the 1990s and early 2000s saw this momentum decline quickly. One of the first signs of this was the party's poor result in the 1990 presidential election, in which their candidate Austin Currie obtained just 17% of the first preference vote.\nFine Gael formed a government between 1994 and 1997 with the Labour Party and the Democratic Left. This government legalised divorce after a successful referendum in 1995. The party's share of TDs fell from 54 in 1997 to only 31 in the 2002 general election, its second-worst result ever at that point. It was at this point Enda Kenny took over leadership of the party and began the process of rebuilding it. At the 2007 general election Kenny was able to bring Fine Gael back to its 1997 levels with 51 TDs.\nRecovery.\nThe collapse of the Celtic Tiger resulted in the post-2008 Irish economic downturn, which threw Ireland not only into economic turmoil but also political upheaval. The 2011 Irish general election saw the governing Fianna F\u00e1il collapse at the polls, while Fine Gael and the Labour Party returned with their best results ever. For the first time in its history, Fine Gael became the largest party in D\u00e1il Eireann. Once more Fine Gael and Labour paired up to form a government, their tenure marked by the difficulty of trying to guide Ireland towards economic recovery. In 2013, a number of Fine Gael parliamentary party members, including Lucinda Creighton, were expelled from the party for defying the party whip on anti-abortion grounds to oppose the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill. These members subsequently formed a political party called Renua.\nSince 2015.\nIn 2015, the Fine Gael/Labour government held a referendum to allow gay marriage under the constitution. The government campaigned for a yes vote and were successful. Following the 2016 general election, Fine Gael retained control of the government as a minority government, made possible by a confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F\u00e1\u00edl, who agreed to abstain in confidence votes. Enda Kenny resigned as party leader in 2017. Following a leadership contest, Leo Varadkar became his successor as well as Taoiseach. In doing so, Varadkar became one of the first openly LGBT heads of government in the world. In 2018 the Fine Gael government held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment, the provision in the Irish constitution which forbid abortion. The party campaigned to repeal the amendment and was successful.\nAfter the 2020 general election, for the first time in history, Fine Gael entered into a coalition government with its traditional rival Fianna F\u00e1il, as well as the Green Party, with Leo Varadkar serving as T\u00e1naiste for the first half of the government's five-year term, then becoming Taoiseach in December 2022. Leo Varadkar resigned as leader of Fine Gael on 20 March 2024, and was succeeded by Simon Harris, who was elected unopposed on 24 March.\nIdeology and policies.\nAs a political party of the centre to centre-right, Fine Gael has been described as liberal-conservative, Christian-democratic, liberal, conservative liberal, conservative, and pro-European, with an ideological base combining elements of cultural conservatism and economic liberalism.\nAlthough Ireland's political spectrum was traditionally divided along Civil War lines, rather than the traditional European left\u2013right spectrum, Fine Gael is described generally as a centre to centre-right party, with a focus on \"fiscal rectitude\". As the descendant of the pro-Treaty factions in the Irish Civil War, Fine Gael cites Michael Collins as an inspiration and claims his legacy. He remains a symbol for the party, and the anniversary of his death is commemorated each year in August.\nAlthough Fine Gael was historically a Catholic party, it became the de facto home for Irish Protestants. Its membership base had a higher proportion of Protestants than that of Fianna F\u00e1il or Labour. The party promoted a strong Catholic image and depicted itself as a defender of Catholicism against Atheistic Communism, of which it accused the two aforementioned parties of being sympathetic to.\nSocial policies.\nFine Gael adopted the \"Just Society\" policy statement in the 1960s, based on principles of social justice and equality. It was created by the emerging social democratic wing of the party, led by Declan Costello. The ideas expressed in the policy statement had a significant influence on the party in the years to come.\nWhile Fine Gael was traditionally socially conservative for most of the twentieth century due to the conservative Christian ethos of Irish society during this time, its members are variously influenced by social liberalism, social democracy and Christian democracy on issues of social policy. Under Garret FitzGerald, the party's more socially liberal, or pluralist, wing gained prominence. Proposals to allow divorce were put to referendum by two Fine Gael\u2013led governments, in 1986 under FitzGerald, and in 1995 under John Bruton, passing very narrowly on this second attempt. Its modern supporters have shown a preference for postmaterialist values.\nLGBT+ issues.\nFine Gael supported civil unions for same-sex couples from 2003, voting for the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2010. In 2012, the party approved a motion at its Ardfheis to prioritise the consideration of same-sex marriage in the upcoming constitutional convention. In 2013, party leader and Taoiseach Enda Kenny declared his support for same-sex marriage. The Fine Gael\u2013led government held a referendum on the subject on 22 May 2015. The referendum passed, with the electorate voting to extend full marriage rights to same-sex couples, with 62.1% in favour and 37.9% opposed.\nIn 2015, months before the marriage equality referendum, Leo Varadkar became the first Irish government minister to come out as gay. In May 2019, former Rose of Tralee Maria Walsh, was elected as a Fine Gael MEP for the Midlands-Northwest constituency in the 2019 European Parliament election, running alongside Mair\u00e9ad McGuinness MEP. Walsh was Fine Gael's first openly lesbian candidate.\nFine Gael has an LGBT+ section, Fine Gael LGBT, and in 2017, Leo Varadkar became the first Taoiseach to march in Dublin Pride.\nAbortion.\nIn 1983, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which proposed to protect the life of the unborn, was put to a referendum. Fine Gael initially supported the proposal, but then came out in opposition to it. Under leader and Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, the party campaigned for a 'No' vote, arguing, on the advice of the Attorney General Peter Sutherland, that the wording, which had been drafted under the previous government, was ambiguous and open to many interpretations. Its stance conflicted with that of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign (PLAC) and Catholic bishops, and Fianna F\u00e1il, the largest party in the State at the time, but then in opposition. The amendment resulted in the addition of Article 40.3.3\u00b0 to the Constitution, giving the unborn child a qualified equal right to life to that of the mother.\nIn 1992, in the X Case, the Supreme Court held that a risk to the life of woman from suicide was a permissible ground under Article 40.3.3\u00b0 for abortion. In 2002, Fine Gael campaigned against the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which proposed to remove suicide as a grounds for granting a termination of a pregnancy. The amendment was rejected by Irish voters.\nIn 2013 it proposed, and supported, the enactment of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which implemented in statute law the \"X case\" ruling of the Supreme Court, granting access to a termination of a pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, not the health, of the mother, including a threat of suicide. Five TDs and two Senators, including Minister of State Lucinda Creighton, lost the Fine Gael party whip for voting against the legislation. Creighton later left Fine Gael to found Renua. The Act was criticised by various anti-abortion groups and Catholic bishops, but supported by a majority of the electorate in opinion polls, with many indicating they wished to see a more liberal law on abortion.\nEnda Kenny's Fine Gael\u2013led minority government took office after the 2016 election with a programme which promised a randomly selected Citizens' Assembly to report on possible changes to the Eighth Amendment, which would be considered by an Oireachtas committee, to whose report the government would respond officially in debates in both houses of the Oireachtas. Fine Gael Oireachtas members were promised a free vote on the issue. Leo Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny as Taoiseach on 14 June 2017 and promised to hold a referendum on abortion in 2018. Several Fine Gael TDs, notably Health Minister Simon Harris and Kate O'Connell, were prominent supporters of the pro-choice side before and during the referendum. While the party was divided, the majority of Fine Gael TDs and Senators, as well as most members, were in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment. A referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment was held on 25 May 2018 and was approved by 66.4% of voters.\nDrug policies.\nThe party has traditionally held a strong stance against the decriminalisation of drugs. In 2007, Fine Gael's leader at the time Enda Kenny called for drug and alcohol testing to be performed in schools, saying cocaine usage at schools was \"rampant\" in some areas.\nAt the party's 2014 Ard Fheis, a proposed motion to support the legalisation of cannabis was voted down by the membership.\nIn 2016, the Fine Gael health minister James Reilly said that they would not be changing their policy on the legalisation of cannabis, due to \"serious concerns about the health impacts\" of cannabis.\nEconomic policies.\nFine Gael has, since its inception, portrayed itself as a party of fiscal rectitude and minimal government interference in economics, advocating pro-enterprise policies. In that they followed the line of the previous pro-Treaty government that believed in minimal state intervention, low taxes and social expenditures. Newly elected politicians for the party in the D\u00e1il have strongly advocated liberal economic policies. Lucinda Creighton (who has since left the party) and Leo Varadkar in particular have been seen as strong advocates of a neoliberal approach to Ireland's economic woes and unemployment problems. Varadkar in particular has been a strong proponent of small, indigenous business, advocating in 2008 that smaller firms should have benefitted from the government's recapitalisation program. Its former finance spokesman Richard Bruton's proposals were seen as approaching problems from a pro-enterprise point of view. Its fairer budget website in 2011 suggested that its solutions are \"tough but fair\". Other solutions conform generally to conservative governments' policies throughout Europe, focusing on cutting numbers in the public sector, while maintaining investment in infrastructure.\nFine Gael's proposals have sometimes been criticised mostly by smaller political groupings in Ireland, and by some of the trade unions, who have raised the idea that the party's solutions are more conscious of business interests than the interests of the worker. In 2008 the SIPTU trade union stated its opposition to then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny's assertion, in response to Ireland's economic crisis, that the national wage agreement ought to have been suspended. Kenny's comments had support however and the party attributed its significant rise in polls in 2008 to this.\nFine Gael's Simon Coveney launched what the party termed a radical re-organisation of the Irish semi-state company sector. Styled the New Economy and Recovery Authority (or NewERA), Coveney said that it is an economic stimulus plan that will \"reshape the Irish economy for the challenges of the 21st century\". Requiring an \u20ac18.2 billion investment in Energy, Communications and Water infrastructure over a four-year period, it was promoted as a way to enhance energy security and the digital reputation of Ireland. A very broad-ranging document, it proposed the combined management of a portfolio of semi-state assets, and the sale of all other, non-essential services. The release of equity through the sale of the various state resources, including electricity generation services belonging to the ESB, Bord na M\u00f3na and Bord G\u00e1is, in combination with use of money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, was Fine Gael's proposed funding source for its national stimulus package.\nThe plan was seen as the longer term contribution to Fine Gael's economic agenda and the basis of its program for government. It was publicised in combination with a more short term policy proposal from Leo Varadkar. This document, termed \"Hope for a Lost Generation\", promised to bring 30,000 young Irish people off the Live Register in a year by combining a National Internship Program, a Second Chance Education Scheme, an Apprenticeship Guarantee and Community Work Program, as well as instituting a German style Workshare program.\nConstitutional reform policies.\nIn 2010 Fine Gael's Phil Hogan published the party's proposals for political and constitutional reform. In a policy document entitled \"New Politics\", Hogan suggested creating a country with \"a smaller, more dynamic and more responsive political system\" by reducing the size of the D\u00e1il by 20, changing the way the D\u00e1il works, and by abolishing the Irish senate, Seanad \u00c9ireann.\nThe question of whether to abolish the Seanad or not was put to a referendum in 2013, with voters voting 51% to 49% to retain bicameralism in Ireland.\nHealth policies.\nThe Irish health system, being administered centrally by the Health Service Executive, is seen to be poor by comparison to other countries in Europe, ranking outside expected levels at 25th according to the Euro Health Consumer Index 2006.\nFine Gael has long wanted Ireland to break with the system of private health insurance, public medical cards and what it calls the two tiers of the health system and has launched a campaign to see the system reformed. Speaking in favour of the campaign, Fine Gael then health spokesman James Reilly stated \"Over the last 10\u00a0years the health service has become a shambles. We regularly have over 350 people on trolleys in A&amp;E, waiting lists that go on for months, outpatient waiting lists that go on for years and cancelled operations across the country...\"\nFine Gael launched its FairCare campaign and website in April 2009, which stated that the health service would be reformed away from a costly ineffective endeavour, into a publicly regulated system where compulsory universal health insurance would replace the existing provisions.\nThis strategy was criticised by Fianna F\u00e1il's then-Minister for Children, Barry Andrews. The spokesperson for family law and children, Alan Shatter TD, robustly defended its proposals as the only means of reducing public expenditure, and providing a service in Ireland more akin to the Canadian, German, Dutch and Austrian health systems.\nFine Gael's current healthcare policy revolves around the implementation of Sl\u00e1intecare, a cross-party plan for the reform of the Irish health system. Sl\u00e1intecare is focused on introducing \"a universal single-tiered health service, which guarantees access based on need, not income\u2026 through Universal Health Insurance\".\nPro-Europeanism and defence policies.\nFine Gael is among the most pro-European integration parties in Ireland, having supported the European Constitution, the Lisbon Treaty, and advocating participation in European common defence. The party have been supportive of NATO. In 1998, party leader John Bruton called on Ireland to join the NATO-led Partnership for Peace. The party's youth wing, Young Fine Gael, passed a motion in 2016 calling on the government to apply for membership of NATO.\nUnder Enda Kenny, the party called on the state to end Irish neutrality and to sign up for a European defence structure, with Kenny claiming that \"the truth is, Ireland is not neutral. We are merely unaligned.\" Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fine Gael called for an increase in defence spending, with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney proposing an increase of \u20ac500 million a year and suggesting Ireland needed a \"fundamental rethink\" of its security approach.\nSince Brexit, Fine Gael has taken a strong pro-European stance, stating that Ireland's place is \"at the heart of Europe\". In government, the party has launched the \"Global Ireland\" plan to develop alliances with other small countries across Europe and the world.\nEuropean affiliations.\nFine Gael is a founding member of the European People's Party (EPP), the largest European political party comprising liberal conservative and Christian democratic national-level parties from across Europe. Fine Gael's MEPs sit with the EPP Group in the European Parliament, and Fine Gael parliamentarians also sit with the EPP Groups in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and Committee of the Regions. Young Fine Gael is a member of the Youth of the European People's Party (YEPP).\nIt is inferred from the party's relationship with its European counterparts via membership of the European People's Party that Fine Gael belongs on the centre-right. The party conforms generally with European political parties that identify themselves as being Christian democratic.\nPlanning and payment tribunals.\nThe Moriarty Tribunal has sat since 1997 and has investigated the granting of a mobile phone license to Esat Telecom by Michael Lowry when he was Fine Gael Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in the Rainbow Coalition of the mid-1990s. Lowry resigned from the Cabinet after it was revealed at the Moriarty Tribunal that businessman Ben Dunne had paid for an IR\u00a3395,000 extension to Lowry's County Tipperary home. Lowry, now an independent TD, supported the Fianna F\u00e1il\u2013Green Party government in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann until March 2011.\nIt was also revealed in December 1996 that Fine Gael had received some \u00a3180,000 from Ben Dunne in the period 1987 to 1993. This was composed of \u00a3100,000 in 1993, \u00a350,000 in 1992 and \u00a330,000 in 1989. In addition, Michael Noonan received \u00a33,000 in 1992 towards his election campaign, Ivan Yates received \u00a35,000, Michael Lowry received \u00a35,000 and Sean Barrett received \u00a31,000 in the earlier 1987 election. John Bruton said he had received \u00a31,000 from Dunne in 1982 towards his election campaign, and Dunne had also given \u00a315,000 to the Labour Party during the 1990 Presidential election campaign.\nFollowing revelations at the Moriarty Tribunal on 16 February 1999, in relation to Charles Haughey and his relationship with AIB, former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald confirmed that AIB and Ansbacher wrote off debts of almost \u00a3200,000 that he owed in 1993, when he was in financial difficulties because of the collapse of the aircraft leasing company, GPA, in which he was a shareholder. The write-off occurred after Fitzgerald left politics. Fitzgerald also said he believed his then Fine Gael colleague, Peter Sutherland, who was chairman of AIB at the time, was unaware of the situation.\nLeadership.\nThe leader of the Fine Gael party is Simon Harris. The position of deputy leader has been held since 2024 by Helen McEntee TD, the Minister for Justice.\nParty leader.\nThe following are the terms of office as party leader, and as Taoiseach (bolded) if applicable:\nElectoral performance since 2009.\nIn the 2009 local elections held on 5 June 2009, Fine Gael won 556 seats, surpassing Fianna F\u00e1il which won 407 seats, and making Fine Gael the largest party of local government nationally. They gained 88 seats from their 2004 result.\nIn the 2009 European Parliament election held on the same day as the local elections, which saw a reduction in the number seats from 13 to 12 for Ireland, the party won four seats, retaining the largest number of seats of an Irish party in the European Parliament. This was a loss of one seat from its 2004 result.\nIn the 2011 general election, Fine Gael gained 25 seats bringing them to a total of 76. The party ran candidates in all 43 constituencies and had candidates elected in every constituency except Dublin North-West. Fine Gael won 19 seats in Seanad \u00c9ireann following the 2011 election, a gain of four from the previous election in 2007.\nWhile Fine Gael was responsible for the initial nomination of the uncontested, first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde, a Fine Gael candidate has never won an election to the office of president. The Fine Gael presidential candidate, Gay Mitchell, finished fourth in the 2011 presidential election, with 6.4% of the vote. In 2004, Fine Gael supported the re-election of President Mary McAleese. Similarly, it supported the re-election of Michael D. Higgins in the 2018 presidential election.\nIn the 2016 general election the outgoing government consisting of Fine Gael and its partner the Labour Party was defeated. The previous government had the largest majority in the history of the state with a combined 113 seats out of the 166-seat D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The aftermath of the general election resulted in months of negotiations for an agreement of government. A deal was reached with the main opposition and traditional rival Fianna F\u00e1il to facilitate a minority Fine Gael-led government. Fine Gael governed Ireland alone with eight Independent members of the D\u00e1il until 2020, when the party emerged as the third party following the general election. After governing for several months in a caretaker capacity, Fine Gael agreed to serve in a historic coalition government along with its traditional rival, Fianna F\u00e1il, and the Green Party, with Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin serving as Taoiseach and Leo Varadkar serving as T\u00e1naiste.\nAs per the agreed Programme for Government, on 17 December 2022, Leo Varadkar returned to the role of Taoiseach with Miche\u00e1l Martin as T\u00e1naiste.\nYoung Fine Gael.\nYoung Fine Gael (YFG) is the autonomous youth movement of Fine Gael. It was founded in 1976 by the then leader Garret FitzGerald. It caters for young people under 35 with an interest in Fine Gael and politics, in cities, towns and third level colleges throughout Ireland. YFG is led by its national executive consisting of ten members elected on a regional basis, and on a national panel."}
{"id": "11253", "revid": "38517020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11253", "title": "Fu Manchu", "text": "Dr. Fu Manchu () is a supervillain who was introduced in a series of novels by the English author Sax Rohmer beginning shortly before World War I and continuing for another forty years. The character featured in cinema, television, radio, comic strips and comic books for over 100 years, and he has also become an archetype of the evil criminal genius and mad scientist, while lending his name to the Fu Manchu moustache.\nBackground and publication.\nAccording to his own account, Sax Rohmer decided to start the Dr. Fu Manchu series after his Ouija board spelled out C-H-I-N-A-M-A-N when he asked what would make his fortune. Clive Bloom argues that the portrait of Fu Manchu was based on the popular music hall magician Chung Ling Soo, \"a white man in costume who had shaved off his Victorian moustache and donned a Mandarin costume and pigtail\". As for Rohmer's theories concerning \"Eastern devilry\" and \"the unemotional cruelty of the Chinese\", he seeks to give them intellectual credentials by referring to the travel writing of Bayard Taylor. Taylor was a would-be ethnographer who, though unversed in Chinese language and culture, used the pseudo-science of physiognomy to find in the Chinese race \"deeps on deeps of depravity so shocking and horrible, that their character cannot even be hinted\". Rohmer's protagonists treat him as an authority.\nFu Manchu first appeared in Rohmer's short story \"The Zayat Kiss\" (1912). It and nine further stories were later collected into the 1913 novel \"The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu\". Two more series were collected into \"The Devil Doctor\" (1916) and \"The Si-Fan Mysteries\" (1917), before the character entered a 14-year absence. Following 1931's \"The Daughter of Fu-Manchu\", Rohmer wrote nine more Fu Manchu novels before his death in 1959. Four previously published stories were posthumously collected into \"The Wrath of Fu-Manchu\" (1973). In total, Rohmer wrote 14 novels concerning the character. The image of \"Orientals\" invading Western nations became the foundation of Rohmer's commercial success, being able to sell 20 million copies in his lifetime.\nCharacters.\nDr. Fu Manchu.\nSupervillain Dr. Fu Manchu's murderous plots are marked by the extensive use of arcane methods; he disdains guns or explosives, preferring dacoits (armed robbers in India), Thugs (professional robbers and murderers in India) and members of other secret societies as his agents (usually armed with knives) or using \"pythons and cobras\u00a0... fungi and my tiny allies, the bacilli\u00a0... my black spiders\" and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons. He has a great respect for the truth (in fact, his word is his bond), and uses torture and other gruesome tactics to dispose of his enemies.\nDr. Fu Manchu is described as a mysterious villain because he seldom appears on the scene. He always sends his minions to commit crimes for him. In the novel \"The Insidious Dr Fu-Manchu\", he sends a beautiful young girl to the crime scene to see that the victim is dead. He also sends a dacoit to attack Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr Petrie.\nIn the novel \"Fu Manchu's Bride\" (1933), Dr. Fu Manchu claims to hold doctorates from four Western universities, while in \"Emperor Fu Manchu\" (1959), he states that he attended Heidelberg University, the Sorbonne and the University of Edinburgh. (In the film \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\", however, he states proudly that \"I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ's College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me 'Doctor.) At the time of their first encounter (1911) Dr. Petrie believed that Dr Fu Manchu was more than 70 years old. That would mean that he studied for his first doctorate in the 1860s or 1870s.\nAccording to Cay Van Ash, Rohmer's biographer and former assistant who became the first author to continue the series after Rohmer's death, \"Fu Manchu\" was a title of honor, which referred to \"the warlike Manchu\". Van Ash speculates that Dr. Fu Manchu was a member of the imperial family of China who backed the losing side in the Boxer Rebellion. In the early books (1913\u20131917), Dr. Fu Manchu is an agent of a Chinese tong, known as the \"Si-Fan\", and acts as the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations targeting Westerners living in China. In the later books (1931\u20131959), he has gained control of the \"Si-Fan\", which has been changed from a mere Chinese tong into an international criminal organization under his leadership. In addition to attempting to take over the world and restore China to its former glory (Dr. Fu Manchu's main goals right from the beginning), the \"Si-Fan\" now also tries to eliminate fascist dictators and halt the spread of communism around the globe, for its leader's own selfish reasons. Dr. Fu Manchu knows that both fascism and communism present major obstacles to his plans for world domination. The \"Si-Fan\" is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and human trafficking. Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the elixir of life, a formula that he has spent decades trying to perfect.\nSir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr Petrie.\nOpposing Dr Fu Manchu in the stories are Sir Denis Nayland Smith and, in the first three books, Dr Petrie. Petrie narrates the first three novels. (The later novels are narrated by various other characters allied with Smith right up to the end of the series.) Smith carries on the fight, combating Dr Fu Manchu more by sheer luck and dogged determination than intellectual brilliance except \"in extremis\". Smith and Dr Fu Manchu share a grudging respect for one another, as each believes that a man must keep his word, even to an enemy.\nIn the first three books, Smith serves in the Indian Imperial Police as a police commissioner in Burma who has been granted a roving commission, allowing him to exercise authority over any group who can help him in his mission. When Rohmer revived the series in 1931, Smith, who has been knighted for his efforts to defeat Fu Manchu, is an ex-Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard. He later accepts a position with MI6. Several books have him placed on special assignment with the FBI.\nK\u00e2raman\u00e8h.\nProminent among Dr Fu Manchu's agents is the \"seductively lovely\" K\u00e2raman\u00e8h. Her real name is unknown. She was sold to the \"Si-Fan\" by Egyptian slave traders while she was still a child. K\u00e2raman\u00e8h falls in love with Dr Petrie, the narrator of the first three books in the series, and rescues Petrie and Nayland Smith many times. Eventually the couple are united and she wins her freedom. They marry and have a daughter, Fleurette, who figures in two later novels, \"Fu Manchu's Bride\" (1933) and its sequel, \"The Trail of Fu Manchu\" (1934). Lin Carter later created a son for Dr Petrie and K\u00e2raman\u00e8h.\nFah Lo Suee.\nDr Fu Manchu's daughter, Fah Lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, frequently plotting to usurp her father's position in the \"Si-Fan\" and aiding his enemies both within and outside the organization. Her real name is unknown; Fah Lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment. She is introduced anonymously while still a teenager in the third book in the series and plays a larger role in several of the titles of the 1930s and 1940s. She is known for a time as Koreani after being brainwashed by her father, but her memory is later restored. Like her father, she takes on false identities, among them Madame Ingomar, Queen Mamaloi and Mrs van Roorden. In films she has been portrayed by numerous actresses over the years. Her character is usually renamed in film adaptations because of difficulties with the pronunciation of her name. Anna May Wong played Ling Moy in \"Daughter of the Dragon\" (1931). Myrna Loy portrayed the character (as Fah Lo See) in \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" (1932). Gloria Franklin had the role of Fah Lo Suee in \"Drums of Fu Manchu\" (1940). Laurette Luez played Karamaneh in \"The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu\" (1956), but the character owed more to Fah Lo Suee than to Rohmer's depiction of K\u00e2raman\u00e8h. Tsai Chin portrayed Dr Fu Manchu's daughter Lin Tang in the five Christopher Lee films of the 1960s.\nBooks.\nOther authors.\nDr Fu Manchu also makes appearances in the following non-Fu Manchu/Rohmer works:\nActors.\nActors who have played Dr Fu Manchu:\nActors who have played Dr Petrie:\nActors who have played Sir Denis Nayland Smith\nCultural impact.\nThe style of facial hair associated with Fu Manchu in film adaptations has become known as the Fu Manchu moustache. The \"Fu Manchu\" moustache is defined in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" as a \"long, narrow moustache whose ends taper and droop down to the chin\", although Rohmer's writings described the character as wearing no such adornment.\nBefore the creation of Fu Manchu, Chinese people were often portrayed in Western media as victims. Fu Manchu indicated a new phase in which Chinese people were portrayed as perpetrators of crime and threats to Western society as a whole. Rohmer's villain is presented as the kingpin of a plot by the \"yellow races\" threatening the existence of \"the entire white race\", and his narrator opines, \"No white man, I honestly believe, appreciates the unemotional cruelty of the Chinese.\"\nThe character of Dr. Fu Manchu became, for many, a stereotype embodying the \"Yellow Peril\". For others, Fu Manchu became the most notorious personification of Western views of the Chinese, and became the model for other villains in contemporary \"Yellow Peril\" thrillers: these villains often had characteristics consistent with xenophobic and racist stereotypes which coincided with a significant increase in Chinese emigration to Western countries.\nAfter the Second World War, the stereotype inspired by Fu Manchu increasingly became a subject of satire. Fred Fu Manchu, a \"famous Chinese bamboo saxophonist\", was a recurring character on \"The Goon Show\", a 1950s British radio comedy programme. He was featured in the episode \"The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu Manchu\" in 1955 (announced as \"Fred Fu Manchu and his Bamboo Saxophone\"), and made minor appearances in other episodes (including \"China Story\", \"The Siege of Fort Night\", and in \"The Lost Emperor\" as \"Doctor Fred Fu Manchu, Oriental tattooist\"). The character was created and performed by the comedian Spike Milligan, who used it to mock the racist attitudes which had led to the creation of the character. The character was also parodied in a later radio comedy, \"Round the Horne\", as Dr Chu En Ginsberg MA (failed), portrayed by Kenneth Williams.\nDr. Fu Manchu was parodied as the fiendish Dr. Wu in the action-comedy film \"Black Dynamite\" (2009), in which the executor of an evil plan against African Americans is an insidious, moustache-sporting kung fu master.\nScience historian Fred Cooper and colleagues draws a parallel between narratives that COVID-19 was created by China, and the machinations of Fu Manchu, who is \"expert in the deadly application of animal and biological agents\" and who has been depicted on US television shows as threatening the West with lethal diseases.\nIn other media.\nFilm.\nDr Fu Manchu first appeared on the big screen in the British silent film series \"The Mystery of Dr Fu Manchu\" (1923) starring Harry Agar Lyons, a series of 15 short feature films, each running around 20 minutes. Lyons returned to the role in \"The Further Mysteries of Dr Fu Manchu\" (1924), which comprised eight additional short feature films.\nDr Fu Manchu made his American film debut in Paramount Pictures' early talkie \"The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu\" (1929) starring Warner Oland, soon to be known for his portrayal of Charlie Chan. Oland repeated the role in \"The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu\" (1930) and \"Daughter of the Dragon\" (1931) as well as in the short film \"Murder Will Out\" (part of the omnibus film \"Paramount on Parade\") in which Dr. Fu Manchu confronts both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes.\nThe most controversial incarnation of the character was MGM's \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" (1932) starring Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy. At the time of its first release the film was considered racist and offensive by representatives of the Chinese government. The film was suppressed for many years, but has been released on DVD uncut.\nDr Fu Manchu returned to the serial format in Republic Pictures' \"Drums of Fu Manchu\" (1940), a 15-episode serial considered to be one of the best the studio ever made. It was later edited and released as a feature film in 1943.\nOther than an obscure, unauthorized Spanish spoof \"El Otro Fu Manchu\" (1946), the Devil Doctor was absent from the big screen for 25 years, until producer Harry Alan Towers began a series starring Christopher Lee in 1965. Towers and Lee made five Fu Manchu films: \"The Face of Fu Manchu\" (1965), \"The Brides of Fu Manchu\" (1966), \"The Vengeance of Fu Manchu\" (1967), \"The Blood of Fu Manchu\" (1968), and \"The Castle of Fu Manchu\" (1969).\nThe character's last authorised film appearance was in the Peter Sellers spoof \"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu\" (1980), with Sellers featured as both Dr Fu Manchu and Nayland Smith. The film bore little resemblance to any earlier film or the original books. Fu Manchu claims he was known as \"Fred\" at public school, a reference to the character in \"The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu Manchu\", a 1955 episode of \"The Goon Show\" which had co-starred Sellers.\nJes\u00fas Franco, who directed \"The Blood of Fu Manchu\" and \"The Castle of Fu Manchu\", also directed \"The Girl from Rio\", the second of three Harry Alan Towers films based on Rohmer's Fu Manchu-like female character Sumuru. He later directed an unauthorized 1986 Spanish film featuring Dr Fu Manchu's daughter, \"Esclavas del Crimen\".\nIn the film \"Grindhouse\" (2007), Nicolas Cage makes an uncredited comedic cameo appearance as Dr Fu Manchu during the \"trailer\" for the fake film \"Werewolf Women of the SS\", directed by Rob Zombie.\nA composite character of Fu Manchu and the Mandarin, named Xu Wenwu, appears in film \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", portrayed by Tony Leung Chiu-wai. The character was previously referenced in the \"Iron Man\" trilogy and \"All Hail the King\". Xialing, Wenwu's daughter and Shang-Chi's sister, was partially inspired by Fah Lo Suee.\nTelevision.\nA half-hour pilot was produced in 1952 for NBC's consideration starring Cedric Hardwicke as Sir Denis Nayland Smith, John Carradine as Dr. Fu Manchu, and Reed Hadley as Dr. John Petrie. NBC turned it down without broadcasting it, but it has been screened at special events.\nThe television arm of Republic Pictures produced a 13-episode syndicated series, \"The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu\" (1956), starring Glen Gordon as Dr. Fu Manchu, Lester Matthews as Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and Clark Howat as Dr. John Petrie. The title sequence depicted Smith and Dr. Fu Manchu in a game of chess as the announcer stated that \"the devil is said to play for men's souls. So does Dr. Fu Manchu, evil incarnate.\" At the conclusion of each episode, after Nayland Smith and Petrie had foiled Dr. Fu Manchu's latest fiendish scheme, Dr. Fu Manchu would be seen breaking a black chess piece in a fit of frustration (black king's bishop, always the same scene, repeated) just before the closing credits rolled. It was directed by Franklin Adreon, as well as William Witney. Dr. Fu Manchu was never allowed to succeed in this TV series. Unlike the Holmes/Watson type relationship of the films, the series featured Smith as a law enforcement officer and Petrie as a staff member for the Surgeon-General. Though Republic had planned to film 78 episodes for the series, a dispute with Sax Rohmer ended the series after only 13 episodes were produced.\nRadio.\nDr. Fu Manchu's earliest radio appearances were on \"The Collier Hour\" 1927\u20131931 on the Blue Network. This was a radio program designed to promote \"Collier's\" magazine and presented weekly dramatizations of the current issue's stories and serials. Dr. Fu Manchu was voiced by Arthur Hughes. A self-titled show on CBS followed in 1932\u201333. John C. Daly, and later Harold Huber, played Dr. Fu Manchu.\nIn 2010, Fu Manchu's connections with the University of Edinburgh where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp for BBC Radio 4.\nAdditionally, there were \"pirate\" broadcasts from the continent into Britain, from Radio Luxembourg and Radio Lyons in 1936 through 1937. Frank Cochrane voiced Dr. Fu Manchu. The BBC produced a competing radio play, \"The Peculiar Case at the Poppy Club\" written by Rohmer and broadcast in December 1938. In 1939, \"The Shadow of Fu Manchu\" aired in the United States as a thrice-weekly serial dramatizing the first nine novels.\nComic strips.\nDr. Fu Manchu was first brought to newspaper comic strips in a black and white daily comic strip drawn by Leo O'Mealia (1884\u20131960) that ran from 1931 to 1933. The strips were adaptations of the first two Dr. Fu Manchu novels and part of the third. Unlike most other illustrators, O'Mealia drew Dr. Fu Manchu as a clean-shaven man with an abnormally large cranium. The strips were copyrighted by \"Sax Rohmer and The Bell Syndicate, Inc.\" Two of the Dr. Fu Manchu comic strip storylines were reprinted in the 1989 book \"Fu Manchu: Two Complete Adventures\". In 1940, the Chicago Tribune published an adaptation of \"Drums of Fu Manchu\", at first it was a photo comics, but later it was illustrated by a unicredit artist.\nBetween 1962 and 1973, the French newspaper \"Le Parisien Lib\u00e9r\u00e9\" published a comic strip by Juliette Benzoni (script) and Robert Bressy (art).\nRole-playing games.\nFu Manchu appears in the adventures \"Night Moves\" and \"Night Live\" for the role-playing game \"Marvel Super Heroes\".\nAccusations of racism.\nThe stories of Dr Fu Manchu, both in print and on screen, have sparked accusations of racism and orientalism, from his fiendish design to his nonsensical Chinese name. After the release of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's film adaptation of \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" (1932), which featured the Chinese villain telling his followers that they must \"kill the white man and take his women\", the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, issued a formal complaint against the film.\nFollowing the release of Republic Pictures' serial adaptation of \"Drums of Fu Manchu\" (1940) the U.S. State Department requested that the studio make no further films about the character, as China was an ally against Japan during the Second World War. Likewise, Rohmer's publisher, Doubleday, refused to publish additions to the best-selling series for the duration of the Second World War once the United States entered the conflict. BBC Radio and Broadway investors subsequently rejected Rohmer's proposals for an original Fu Manchu radio serial and stage show during the 1940s.\nThe re-release of \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" in 1972 was met with protests from the Japanese American Citizens League, which stated that \"the movie was offensive and demeaning to Asian Americans\". CBS Television decided to cancel a showing of \"The Vengeance of Fu Manchu\". Los Angeles TV station KTLA shared similar sentiments, but ultimately decided to run \"The Brides of Fu Manchu\" with the disclaimer: \"This feature is presented as fictional entertainment and is not intended to reflect adversely on any race, creed or national origin.\"\nRohmer responded to charges that his work demonized Asians in \"Master of Villainy\", a biography co-written by his widow:\nIt was Rohmer's contention that he based Dr Fu Manchu and other \"Yellow Peril\" mysteries on real Chinese criminals he met as a newspaper reporter covering Limehouse.\nIn May 2013, General Motors cancelled an advertisement after complaints that a phrase it contained, \"the land of Fu Manchu\", which was intended to refer to China, was offensive.\nCharacterizing Dr Fu Manchu as an overtly racist creation has been criticized in the book \"Lord of Strange Deaths: The Fiendish World of Sax Rohmer\". In a review of the book in \"The Independent\", Dr Fu Manchu is contextualised: \"These magnificently absurd books, glowing with a crazed exoticism, are really far less polar, less black and white, less white and yellow, than they first seem.\""}
{"id": "11254", "revid": "44044858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11254", "title": "Friesland", "text": "Friesland ( ; ; official ), historically and traditionally known as Frisia (), named after the Frisians, is a province of the Netherlands located in the country's northern part. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the Wadden Sea. As of January 2023, the province had a population of about 660,000, and a total area of .\nThe province is divided into 18 municipalities. The capital and seat of the provincial government is the city of Leeuwarden (West Frisian: \"Ljouwert\", Liwwaddes: \"Liwwadde\"), a city with 123,107 inhabitants. Other large municipalities in Friesland are Sneek (pop. 33,512), Heerenveen (pop. 50,257), and Smallingerland (includes town of Drachten, pop. 55,938). Since 2017, Arno Brok is the King's Commissioner in the province. A coalition of the Christian Democratic Appeal, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, the Labour Party, and the Frisian National Party forms the executive branch. The area of the province was once part of the ancient, larger region of Frisia, which gave the province its name. The land is mostly made up of grassland and it has numerous lakes. The official languages of Friesland are West Frisian and Dutch.\nToponymy.\nIn 1996, the Provincial Council of Friesland resolved that the official name of the province should follow the West Frisian spelling rather than the Dutch spelling, resulting in \"Friesland\" being replaced by \"Frysl\u00e2n\". In 2004, the Dutch government confirmed this resolution, putting in place a three-year scheme to oversee the name change and associated cultural programme.\nThe province of Friesland is occasionally referred to as \"Frisia\" by, amongst others, Hanno Brand, head of the history and literature department at the Fryske Akademy since 2009. However, the English-language webpage of the Friesland Provincial Council refers to the province as \"Frysl\u00e2n\".\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe Frisii were among the migrating Germanic tribes that, following the breakup of Celtic Europe in the 4th century BC, settled along the North Sea. They came to control the area from roughly present-day Bremen to Bruges, and conquered many of the smaller offshore islands. What little is known of the Frisii is provided by a few Roman accounts, most of them military. Pliny the Elder said their lands were forest-covered with tall trees growing up to the edge of the lakes. They lived by agriculture and raising cattle.\nIn his \"Germania\", Tacitus described all the Germanic peoples of the region as having elected kings with limited powers and influential military leaders who led by example rather than by authority. The people lived in spread-out settlements. He specifically noted the weakness of Germanic political hierarchies in reference to the Frisii, when he mentioned the names of two kings of the 1st century Frisii and added that they were kings \"as far as the Germans are under kings\".\nIn the 1st century BC, the Frisii halted a Roman advance and thus managed to maintain their independence. Some or all of the Frisii may have joined into the Frankish and Saxon peoples in late Roman times, but they would retain a separate identity in Roman eyes until at least 296, when they were forcibly resettled as \"laeti\" (Roman-era serfs) and thereafter disappear from recorded history. Their tentative existence in the 4th century is confirmed by archaeological discovery of a type of earthenware unique to 4th-century Frisia, called \"terp Tritzum\", showing that an unknown number of Frisii were resettled in Flanders and Kent, likely as \"laeti\" under the aforementioned Roman coercion. The lands of the Frisii were largely abandoned by as a result of the conflicts of the Migration Period, climate deterioration, and the flooding caused by a rise in the sea level.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nThe area lay empty for one or two centuries, when changing environmental and political conditions made the region habitable again. At that time, during the Migration Period, \"new\" Frisians (probably descended from a merging of Frisii, Angles, Saxons and Jutes) repopulated the coastal regions. These Frisians consisted of tribes with loose bonds, centred on war bands but without great power. The earliest Frisian records name four social classes, the (\"nobiles\" in Latin documents; \"adel\" in Dutch and German) and (\"vrijen\" in Dutch and \"Freien\" in German), who together made up the \"Free Frisians\" who might bring suit at court, and the \"laten\" or \"liten\" with the slaves, who were absorbed into the \"laten\" during the Early Middle Ages, as slavery was not so much formally abolished, as evaporated. The \"laten\" were tenants of lands they did not own and might be tied to it in the manner of serfs, but in later times might buy their freedom.\nUnder the rule of King Aldgisl, the Frisians came in conflict with the Frankish mayor of the palace Ebroin, over the old Roman border fortifications. Aldgisl could keep the Franks at a distance with his army. During the reign of Redbad, however, the tide turned in favour of the Franks; in 690, the Franks were victorious in the Battle of Dorestad. In 733, Charles Martel sent an army against the Frisians. The Frisian army was pushed back to Eastergoa. The next year the Battle of the Boarn took place. Charles ferried an army across the Almere with a fleet that enabled him to sail up to De Boarn. The Frisians were defeated in the ensuing battle, and their last king Poppo was killed. The victors began plundering and burning heathen sanctuaries. Charles Martel returned with much loot, and broke the power of the Frisian kings for good. The Franks annexed the Frisian lands between the Vlie and the Lauwers. They conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785, when Charlemagne defeated Widukind. The Carolingians laid Frisia under the rule of \"grewan\", a title that has been loosely related to count in its early sense of \"governor\" rather than \"feudal overlord\". About 100,000 Dutch drowned in a flood in 1228.\nFrisian freedom.\nWhen, around 800, the Scandinavian Vikings first attacked Frisia, which was still under Carolingian rule, the Frisians were released from military service on foreign territory in order to be able to defend themselves against the heathen Vikings. With their victory in the Battle of Norditi in 884 they were able to drive the Vikings permanently out of East Frisia, although it remained under constant threat. Over the centuries, whilst feudal lords reigned in the rest of Europe, no aristocratic structures emerged in Frisia. This 'Frisian freedom' was represented abroad by \"redjeven\" who were elected from among the wealthier farmers or from elected representatives of the autonomous rural municipalities. Originally the \"redjeven\" were all judges, so-called \"Asega\", who were appointed by the territorial lords.\nAfter significant territories were lost to Holland in the Friso-Hollandic Wars, Frisia saw an economic downturn in the mid-14th century. Accompanied by a decline in monasteries and other communal institutions, social discord led to the emergence of untitled nobles called \"haadlingen\" (\"headmen\"), wealthy landowners possessing large tracts of land and fortified homes who took over the role of the judiciary as well as offering protection to their local inhabitants. Internal struggles between regional leaders resulted in bloody conflicts and the alignment of regions along two opposing parties: the Fetkeapers and Skieringers. On 21 March 1498, a small group of Skieringers from Westergo secretly met with Albert III, Duke of Saxony, the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, in Medemblik requesting his help. Albrecht, who had gained a reputation as a formidable military commander, accepted and soon conquered all Friesland. Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg appointed Albrecht hereditary potestate and gubernator of Friesland in 1499.\nIn 1515, an army of haadlingen and peasants, with the help of mercenaries known as the Arumer Zwarte Hoop, started a fight for freedom from oppression by the Habsburg authorities. One of the leaders was Pier Gerlofs Donia, whose farm had been burned down and whose kinfolk had been killed by a marauding \"Landsknecht\" regiment. Since the regiment had been employed by the Habsburg authorities to suppress the civil war of the Fetkeapers and Skieringers, Donia put the blame on the authorities. After this he gathered angry peasants and some petty noblemen from Frisia and Gelderland and formed the \"Arumer Zwarte Hoop\".The rebels received financial support from Charles II, Duke of Guelders, who claimed the Duchy of Guelders in opposition to the House of Habsburg. Charles also employed mercenaries under command of his military commander Maarten van Rossum in their support. However, when the tides turned against the rebels after the Donia's death in 1520, Charles withdrew his support, without which the rebels could no longer afford to pay their mercenary army. The revolt was put to an end in 1523 and Frisia was incorporated into the Habsburg Netherlands, bringing an end to the Frisian freedom.\nModern times.\nCharles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, became the first lord of the Lordship of Frisia. He appointed Georg Schenck van Toutenburg, who had crushed the peasants' revolt, as Stadtholder to rule over the province in his stead. When Charles abdicated in 1556, Frisia was inherited by Philip II of Spain along with the rest of the Netherlands. In 1566, Frisia joined the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule.\nIn 1577, George de Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg was appointed Stadtholder of Frisia and other provinces. A moderate, trusted by both sides, he tried to reconcile the rebels with the Crown. But in 1580, Rennenburg declared for Spain. The States of Frisia raised troops and took his strongholds of Leeuwarden, Harlingen and Stavoren. Rennenburg was deposed and Frisia became the fifth Lordship to join the rebels' Union of Utrecht. From 1580 onward, all stadtholders were members of the House of Orange-Nassau. With the Peace of M\u00fcnster in 1648, Frisia became a full member of the independent Dutch Republic, a federation of provincies. In economic and therefore also political importance, Friesland was next in rank to the provinces of Holland and Zeeland.\nIn 1798, three years after the Batavian Revolution, the provincial lordship of Frisia was abolished and its territory was divided between the Eems and Oude IJssel departments. This was short-lived, however, as Frisia was revived as a department in 1802. When the Netherlands were annexed by the First French Empire in 1810, the department was in French renamed Frise. After Napoleon was defeated in 1813 and a new constitution was introduced in 1814, Friesland became a province of the Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands, then of the unitary Kingdom of the Netherlands a year later.\nGeography.\nFriesland is situated at in the northwest of the Netherlands, west of the province of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of the IJsselmeer and North Holland, and south of the North Sea. It is the largest province of the Netherlands if one includes areas of water; in terms of land area only, it is the third-largest province.\nMost of Friesland is on the mainland, but it also includes a number of West Frisian Islands, including Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog, which are connected to the mainland by ferry. The province's highest point is a dune at above sea level, on the island of Vlieland.\nThere are four national parks of the Netherlands located in Friesland: Schiermonnikoog, De Alde Feanen, Lauwersmeer (partially in Groningen), and Drents-Friese Wold (also partially situated in Drenthe).\nUrban areas.\nThe ten urban areas in Friesland with the largest population are:\nMunicipalities.\nThe province is divided into 18 municipalities, each with local government (municipal council, mayor and aldermen).\nClimate.\nThe province of Friesland, like the rest of the Netherlands, has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\").\nDemography.\nIn 2023, Friesland had a population of 659,551 and a population density of .\nThe years 1880\u20131900 show slower population growth due to an agricultural recession during which some 20,000 Frisians emigrated to the United States.\nAnthropometry.\nSince the late Middle Ages, Friesland has been renowned for the exceptional height of its inhabitants. Even early Renaissance poet Dante Alighieri refers to the height of Frisians in his \"Divine Comedy\" when, in the canticle about Hell, he talks about the magnitude of an infernal demon by stating that \"not even three tall Frieslanders, were they set one upon the other, would have matched his height\".\nReligion.\nIn 2015, 28.5% of the population belonged to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, while 6.6% were Roman Catholic, 1.1% were Muslim and 6.5% belonged to other churches or faiths. Over half of the population (57.2%) identified as non-religious.\nEconomy.\nFriesland is mainly an agricultural province. The black and white Frisian cattle, black and white Stabyhoun and the black Frisian horse originated here. Tourism is another important source of income: the principal tourist destinations include the lakes in the southwest of the province and the islands in the Wadden Sea to the north. There are 195 windmills in the province of Friesland, out of a total of about 1200 in the entire country.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 19.8 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 2.6% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac26,700 or 89% of the EU27 average in the same year.\nCulture.\nLanguages.\nFriesland is one of the twelve provinces of the Netherlands to have its national language that is recognized as such, West Frisian. Before the 18th century, varieties of Frisian were also spoken in the provinces of North Holland and Groningen, and together with the Frisian speakers in East Friesland and North Friesland a continuous linguistic area existed between Amsterdam and the present day Danish-German border.\nThe mutual intelligibility in reading between Dutch and Frisian is limited. A cloze test in 2005 revealed native Dutch speakers understood 31.9% of a West Frisian newspaper, 66.4% of an Afrikaans newspaper and 97.1% of a Dutch newspaper. In 2007, West Frisian is the native language of 54.3% of the inhabitants of the province of Friesland, followed by Dutch with 34.7%, and speakers of other regional languages, most of these restricted to Friesland, with 9.7%, and in the end other foreign languages with 1.4%. Frisian speakers are traditionally underrepresented in urban areas, and predominant in the countryside.\nWest Frisian is also spoken in a small adjacent part of the province of Groningen. Up to the 18th century Frisian was spoken in the, at that time Prussian and Hanoverian, lordships of East Friesland). Since then the East Frisian population switched to East Frisian (\"Ostfriesisch\"), a Low German dialect. Only in some, formerly remoted, East Frisian villages (Saterland) a variety of historically East Frisian (\"Seeltersk\") is still in use but by an older generation. A collection of dialects named North Frisian, is or was spoken in North Friesland, alongside the North Sea coast and on the islands of Schleswig-Holstein. The named Frisian languages are historically related to Old English, which points towards the fact that Angles and Saxons, eventually accompanied by Frisians, came from these areas.\nIn Stellingwerf, in south-east Friesland, a dialect of Low Saxon is spoken, as is in the northeast in Kollumerpomp.\nIn the former municipality of het Bildt the Hollandic dialect of Bildts is spoken. It contains a lot of Frisian influence. In most of the cities of Leeuwarden, Town Frisian is spoken. As with Bildts, these variants are Hollandic dialects with Frisian influence.\nThe language policy in Friesland is preservation. West Frisian is a mandatory subject in Friesland in primary and secondary schools of the Frisian speaking districts. Bilingual (Dutch\u2013Frisian) and trilingual (Dutch\u2013English\u2013Frisian) schools in the province of Friesland use West Frisian as a language of instruction in some lessons, besides Dutch in most other lessons and alongside them English. Literacy in Frisian however, is not often a core aim and that makes the number of Frisians speakers able to write in Frisian only 12%.\nThe provincial government takes various initiatives to preserve the West Frisian language. All parents in Friesland receive, at their children's birth, information about language and multilingualism (e.g. 'taaltaske'). To support the use of Frisian in public and at public events, the province also invests in the development of speech pathology materials and strives to create information technology devices for the West Frisian language. The Frisian government subsidizes the \"Af\u00fbk\" organization, which offers language courses and actively promotes Frisian in all sectors of society as well as the corporate domain which as a rule is dominated by Dutch and English. The province also promotes a wide range of art and entertainment in Frisian.\nSports.\nThe province is famous for its speed skaters, with mass participation in cross-country ice skating when weather conditions permit. When winters are cold enough to allow the freshwater canals to freeze hard, the province holds its traditional Elfstedentocht (Eleven cities tour), a ice skating tour. A traditional sport is Frisian handball. Another Frisian practice is \"fierljeppen\", a sport with some similarities to pole vaulting. A jump consists of an intense sprint to the pole (\"polsstok\"), jumping and grabbing it, then climbing to the top while trying to control the pole's forward and lateral movements over a body of water and finishing with a graceful landing on a sand bed opposite to the starting point. Because of all the diverse skills required in fierljeppen, fierljeppers are considered to be very complete athletes with superbly developed strength and coordination. In the warmer months, many Frisians practice \"wadlopen\", the traditional art of wading across designated sections of the Wadden Sea at low tide.\nFriesland has lots of waterways and lakes there for Sailcontests with a Skutsje or frisian Tjalk is done during the summer on various lakes.\nThere are currently two professional football clubs playing in Friesland: SC Cambuur from Leeuwarden (home stadium Cambuur Stadion) active in de keuken kampioen divisie(2nd div.) and SC Heerenveen (home stadium Abe Lenstra Stadion) active in de Eredivisie(1st div.).\nPolitics.\nThe King's Commissioner of Friesland is Arno Brok. The Provincial Council of Friesland has 43 seats. The Provincial Executive was a coalition of the Christian Democratic Appeal, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, the Labour Party and the Frisian National Party (FNP), until 2023 when new provincial elections saw a different composition in the provincial council.\n!colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\"|Party\n!Votes\n!Seats\n!colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\"|Total\n! 298.241\n!align=\"center\" | 43\nTransport.\nThe four motorways in the province are A6, A7 (E22), A31, and A32.\nThe main railway station of Friesland is Leeuwarden, which connects the railways Arnhem\u2013Leeuwarden, Harlingen\u2013Nieuweschans, and Leeuwarden\u2013Stavoren which are all (partially) located in the province.\nAmeland Airport near Ballum and Drachten Airfield near Drachten are the two small general aviation airports in the province. The Royal Netherlands Air Force uses Vlieland Heliport and the Leeuwarden Air Base.\nMedia.\n\"Friesch Dagblad\" and \"Leeuwarder Courant\" are daily newspapers mainly written in Dutch. Omrop Frysl\u00e2n is the public broadcaster with radio and TV programs mainly in Frisian."}
