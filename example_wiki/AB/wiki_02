Feminist SF is political because of its tendency to critique the dominant culture. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.\nDefinition.\nFeminist science fiction is a sub-genre of science fiction (SF for short) that focuses on theories that include feminist themes, for example gender inequality, sexuality, race, economics and reproduction. Feminist science fiction spans a wider range than science fiction itself, covering fantasy, utopia and dystopia, horror (such as Anne Rice's vampire stories). Marleen S. Barr says that what is described as feminist \u2018SF\u2019 is not really \u2018SF\u2019 at all, because it is not concerned with \u2018hard science\u2019 but with women's drive for power. Hard science fiction is of course a subset of science fiction. She thought we needed to use a term like feminist fabulation.\nFantasy literature is de facto a privileged genre for tackling feminist themes. Because it allows to reflect on the future, on the possibilities of humanity and science, this literature allows all progressive and innovative ideas to coexist. So, to qualify as feminist science fiction, the stories must carry a political message, that of challenging the male/female paradigm in society. With this in mind, in the early 1990s the American feminist fanzine Aurora SF published a list of ten levels of feminism to measure the political content of a text. This graduation of the political message ranges from simple questioning of patriarchal society, to egalitarian discourse between the sexes, to systematic criticism of men, to the establishment of feminist and lesbian utopia.\nIn her book \"In the chinks of the world machine: feminism and science fiction\", Scottish author Sarah LeFanu distinguishes between feminist SF and women's SF insofar as the latter, while having a certain influence on the development of science fiction in general by rejecting sexism and featuring female heroes, does not make feminist demands.\nFeminist science fiction (SF) distinguishes between \"female\" SF authors and \"feminist\" SF authors. Both female and feminist SF authors are historically significant to the feminist SF subgenre, as female writers have increased women's visibility and perspectives in SF literary traditions, while the feminist writers have foregrounded political themes and tropes in their works. Because distinctions between female and feminist can be blurry, whether a work is considered feminist can be debatable, but there are generally agreed-upon canonical texts, which help define the subgenre.\nHistory.\nEarly modern times.\nAs early as the English Restoration, female authors were using themes of SF and imagined futures to explore women's issues, roles, and place in society. This can be seen as early as 1666 in Margaret Cavendish's \"The Blazing World\", in which she describes a utopian kingdom ruled by an empress. This foundational work has garnered attention from some feminist critics, such as Dale Spender, who considered this a forerunner of the science fiction genre, more generally. Another early female writer of science fiction was Mary Shelley. Her novel \"Frankenstein\" (1818) dealt with the asexual creation of new life, and has been considered by some a reimagining of the Adam and Eve story.\nHer book is a critique of Darwinist ideas and also of the use of science without ethical reflection, as well as of the seventeenth-century view that science was endowed with a certain virility aimed at penetrating the secrets of nature, presented as other, feminine and objectified. The book paved the way for future explorations of the cyborg theme by feminist science fiction and had a lasting influence.\nIn France, feminist writer Marie-Anne de Roumier-Robert's \"Voyage de Milord C\u00e9ton dans les sept plan\u00e8tes\", published in 1758, is considered one of the first science fiction novels. Refusing to overlook the contribution made by women to science and culture for the sole benefit of men, Marie-Anne Robert wrote an initiatory tale designed to develop women's critical faculties, and ultimately work towards their emancipation.\nFirst-wave feminism (suffrage).\nWomen writers involved in the utopian literature movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries could be considered the first feminist SF authors. Their texts, emerging during the first-wave feminist movement, often addressed issues of sexism through imagining different worlds that challenged gender expectations. In 1881, \"Mizora: A Prophecy\" described a women-only world with technological innovations such as parthenogenesis, videophones, and artificial meat.\nIt was closely followed by other feminist utopian works, such as Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett's \"New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future\" (1889). In 1892, poet and abolitionist Frances Harper published \"Iola Leroy\", one of the first novels by an African American woman. Set during the antebellum South, it follows the life of a mixed race woman with mostly white ancestry and records the hopes of many African Americans for social equality\u2014of race and gender\u2014during Reconstruction. \"Unveiling a Parallel\" (1893) features a male protagonist who takes an \"aeroplane\" to Mars, visiting two different \"Marsian\" societies; in both, there is equality between men and women. In one, Paleveria, women have adopted the negative characteristics of men; in Caskia, the other, gender equality \"has made both sexes kind, loving, and generous.\" Two American Populists, A.O. Grigsby and Mary P. Lowe, published \"NEQUA or The Problem of the Ages\" (1900), which explores issues of gender norms and posited structural inequality. This recently rediscovered novel displays familiar feminist SF conventions: a heroine narrator who masquerades as a man, the exploration of sexist mores, and the description of a future hollow earth society (like \"Mizora\") where women are equal.\n\"The Sultana's Dream\" (1905), by Bengali Muslim feminist Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain, engages with the limited role of women in colonial India. Through depicting a gender-reversed purdah in an alternate technologically futuristic world, Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain,'s book has been described as illustrating the potential for cultural insights through role reversals early on in the subgenre's formation.\nIn the utopian novel \"Beatrice the Sixteenth\" (1909), transgender writer Irene Clyde creates a world where gender is no longer recognized and the story itself is told without the use of gendered nouns. Along these same lines, Charlotte Perkins Gilman explores and critiques the expectations of women and men by creating a single-sex world in \"Herland\" (1915), possibly the most well-known of the early feminist SF and utopian novels.\nAmong the francophones, Ren\u00e9e Marie Gouraud d\u02bbAblancourt published in 1909 \"Vega la magicienne\", depicting L'Oiselle, a winged superheroine and the first of the francophone superhero series.\nRhoda Broughton is also one of a number of 19th-century women writing in the successful science fiction genre.\nRosa Ros\u00e0 (Edith von Haynau) wrote the first Italian feminist science fiction with \"Una donna con tre anime\" in 1918.\nBetween the wars.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, many popular pulp science fiction magazines exaggerated views of masculinity and featured portrayals of women that were perceived as sexist. These views would be subtly satirized by Stella Gibbons in \"Cold Comfort Farm\" (1932) and much later by Margaret Atwood in \"The Blind Assassin\" (2000). As early as 1920, however, women writers of this time, such as Clare Winger Harris (\"The Runaway World,\" 1926) and Gertrude Barrows Bennett (\"Claimed\", 1920), published science fiction stories written from female perspectives and occasionally dealt with gender and sexuality based topics.\nJohn Wyndham, writing under his early pen-name of John Beynon Harris, was a rare pulp writer to include female leads in stories such as The Venus Adventure (Wonder Stories, 1932), in which a mixed crew travel to Venus. The story opens in a future in which women are no longer enslaved by pregnancy and childbirth thanks to artificial incubators, which are opposed by a religious minority. Women have used this freedom to enter professions including chemistry. Wyndham's outlook was so rare that in a serialisation of his novel Stowaway to Mars, one magazine editor \"corrected\" the name of the central character Joan to John. Wyndham then had to write them a new final instalment to replace the conclusion in which Joan fell in love and became pregnant. \n\"The Fate of the Poseidonia\", 1927.\nThe first science fiction story published in a magazine by a woman in America was \"The Fate of the Poseidonia\", written by Claire Winger Harris in 1927. The story was published by Hugo Gernsback in the pulp magazine Amazing Stories. The story was published as part of a science fiction competition, in which 300 short stories were proposed. Hugo Gernsback put out a call to his magazine's readership for this competition, inviting them to send in texts describing the cover of Amazing Stories in December 1926. The cover featured an ocean liner floating in space. Using the term \u2018fans\u2019 to describe his male and female readers, blurring the boundary between readership and writing, he allowed women to take part for the first time. The 1920s saw the establishment of what was later to become \u2018fandom\u2019.\nPost World War II.\nThe Post-WWII and Cold War eras were a pivotal and often overlooked period in feminist SF history. During this time, female authors utilized the SF genre to assess critically the rapidly changing social, cultural, and technological landscape. Women SF authors during the post-WWII and Cold War time periods directly engage in the exploration of the impacts of science and technology on women and their families, which was a focal point in the public consciousness during the 1950s and 1960s. These female SF authors, often published in SF magazines such as \"The Avalonian\", \"Astounding\", \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\", and \"Galaxy\", which were open to new stories and authors that pushed the boundaries of form and content.\nAt the beginning of the Cold War, economic restructuring, technological advancements, new domestic technologies (washing machines, electric appliances), increased economic mobility of an emerging middle class, and an emphasis on consumptive practices, carved out a new technological domestic sphere where women were circumscribed to a new job description \u2013 the professional housewife. Published feminist SF stories were told from the perspectives of women (characters and authors) who often identified within traditional roles of housewives or homemakers, a subversive act in many ways given the traditionally male-centered nature of the SF genre and society during that time.\nIn \"Galactic Suburbia\", author Lisa Yaszek recovers many women SF authors of the post-WWII era such as Judith Merril, author of \"That Only a Mother\" (1948), \"Daughters of Earth\" (1952), \"Project Nursemaid\" (1955), \"The Lady Was a Tramp\" (1957); Alice Eleanor Jones \"Life, Incorporated\" (1955), \"The Happy Clown\" (1955), \"Recruiting Officer\" (1955); and Shirley Jackson \"One Ordinary Day, with Peanuts\" (1955) and \"The Omen\" (1958). These authors often blurred the boundaries of feminist SF fiction and feminist speculative fiction, but their work laid substantive foundations for second-wave feminist SF authors to directly engage with the feminist project. \"Simply put, women turned to SF in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s because it provided them with growing audiences for fiction that was both socially engaged and aesthetically innovative.\"\nSecond-wave feminism.\nBy the 1960s, science fiction was combining sensationalism with political and technological critiques of society. With the advent of second-wave feminism, women's roles were questioned in this \"subversive, mind expanding genre\". Three notable texts of this period are Ursula K. Le Guin's \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" (1969), Marge Piercy's \"Woman on the Edge of Time\" (1976) and Joanna Russ's \"The Female Man\" (1970). Each highlights what the authors believe to be the socially constructed aspects of gender roles by creating worlds with genderless societies. Two of these authors were pioneers in feminist criticism of science fiction during the 1960s and 1970s through essays collected in \"The Language of the Night\" (Le Guin, 1979) and \"How To Suppress Women's Writing\" (Russ, 1983). Also of note, Madeleine L'Engle's \"A Wrinkle in Time\" (1962), written for children and teens, features a 13-year-old girl protagonist, Meg Murry, whose mother, Mrs. Murry, is a scientist with degrees in biology and bacteriology. L'Engle's novel is decidedly science fiction, feminist, and deeply Christian, and the first of her series, \"The Time Quintet\". Meg's adventures to other planets, galaxies, and dimensions are aided in \"Wrinkle\" by three ancient beings, Mrs What, Mrs Which, and Mrs Who who \"tesser\" to travel vast distances. \"A Wrinkle in Time\" was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1963 and has never been out of print. Men also contributed literature to feminist science fiction. Prominently, Samuel R. Delany's short story, \"Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones\" (1968), which won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1970, follows the life of a gay man that includes themes involving sadomasochism, gender, significance of language, and when high and low society encounter one another, while his novel \"Babel-17\" has a Chinese woman as its primary hero and protagonist. Octavia Butler's \"Kindred\" (1979) tells the story of an African American woman living in the United States in 1979 who uncontrollably time travels to the antebellum South. The novel poses complicated questions about the nature of sexuality, gender, and race when the present faces the past.\n\"The Demon Breed\" is a 1968 science fiction novel by James H. Schmitz in which the female main character, Nyles Etland, armed only with intelligence and intimate knowledge of her home environment, allies and science, intimidated an alien species who had intended to invade. Schmitz, who still commands a cult audience half a century after his death, dealt almost exclusively in competent and intelligent female main characters in dozens of novels and short stories.\n1980s onwards.\nFeminist science fiction continues on into the 1980s with Margaret Atwood's novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (1985), a dystopic tale of a theocratic society in which women have been systematically stripped of all liberty. The book was motivated by fear of potential retrogressive effects on women's rights. Sheri S. Tepper is perhaps best known for her series The True Game, which explore the \"Lands of the True Game\", a portion of a planet explored by humanity somewhere in the future. In November 2015, she received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement for this series. Tepper has written under several pseudonyms, including A. J. Orde, E. E. Horlak, and B. J. Oliphant. Carol Emshwiller is another feminist SF author whose best known works are \"Carmen Dog\" (1988), \"The Mount\" (2002), and \"Mister Boots\" (2005). Emshwiller had also been writing SF for \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" since 1974. She won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2005 for her novel \"The Mount\" (2002). This novel explores the prey/predator mentality through an alien race. Another author of the 1980s, Pamela Sargent has written the \"Seed Series\", which included \"Earthseed\", \"Farseed\", and \"Seed Seeker\" (1983\u20132010), the \"Venus Series\" about the terraforming of Venus, which includes \"Venus of Dreams\", \"Venus of Shadows\", and \"Child of Venus\" (1986\u20132001), and \"The Shore of Women\" (1986). Sargent is also the 2012 winner of the Pilgrim Award for lifetime contributions to SF/F studies. Lois McMaster Bujold has won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for her novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\", which is part of her series the \"Vorkosigan Saga\" (1986\u20132012). This saga includes points of view from a number of minority characters, and is also highly concerned with medical ethics, identity, and sexual reproduction.\nMore recent science fiction authors illuminate what they contend are injustices that are still prevalent. At the time of the LA Riots, Japanese-American writer Cynthia Kadohata's work \"In the Heart of the Valley of Love\" (1992) was published. Her story, set in the year 2052, examines tensions between two groups as defined as the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\" and is written as seen through the eyes of a nineteen-year-old girl who is of Asian and African descent. Nalo Hopkinson's \"Falling in Love With Hominids\" (2015) is a collection of her short stories whose subjects range from an historical fantasy involving colonialism in the Caribbean, to age manipulation, to ethnic diversity in the land of Faerie, among others.\nIn the early 1990s, a new award opportunity for feminist SF authors was created. The James Tiptree, Jr. Award is an annual literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one's understanding of gender (Alice Sheldon was a female writer who published science fiction under the Tiptree pen name). Science fiction authors Pat Murphy and Karen Joy Fowler initiated this subsequent discussion at WisCon in February 1991. The authors' publishing in feminist SF after 1991 were now eligible for an award named after one of the genre's beloved authors. Karen Joy Fowler herself is considered a feminist SF writer for her short stories, such as \"What I Didn't See\", for which she received the Nebula Award in 2004. This story is an homage to Sheldon, and describes a gorilla hunting expedition in Africa. Pat Murphy won a number of awards for her feminist SF novels as well, including her second novel \"The Falling Woman\" (1986), a tale of personal conflict and visionary experiences set during an archaeological field study for which she won the Nebula Award in 1988. She won another Nebula Award in the same year for her story \"Rachel in Love\". Her short story collection, \"Points of Departure\" (1990) won the Philip K. Dick Award, and her 1990 novella \"Bones\" won the 1991 World Fantasy Award.\nOther winners of the James Tiptree, Jr. Award include \"The Sparrow\" by Mary Doria Russell (1996), \"Black Wine\" by Candas Jane Dorsey (1997), \"Redwood and Wildfire\" by Andrea Hairston (2011), \"The Carhullan Army\" by Sarah Hall (2007), \"Ammonite\" by Nicola Griffith (1993), and \"The Conqueror's Child\" by Suzy McKee Charnas (1999). All of these authors have had an important impact on the SF world by adding a feminist perspective to the traditionally male genre.\nEileen Gunn's science fiction short story \"Coming to Terms\" received the Nebula Award (2004) in the United States and the Sense of Gender Award (2007) in Japan, and has been nominated twice each for the Hugo Award, Philip K. Dick Award and World Fantasy Award, and short-listed for the James Tiptree, Jr. Award. Her most popular anthology of short stories is \"Questionable Practices\", which includes stories \"Up the Fire Road\" and \"Chop Wood, Carry Water\". She also edited \"The WisCon Chronicles 2: Provocative Essays on Feminism, Race, Revolution, and the Future\" with L. Timmel Duchamp. Duchamp has been known in the feminist SF community for her first novel \"Alanya to Alanya\" (2005), the first of a series of five titled \"The Marq'ssan Cycle\". \"Alanya to Alanya\" is set on a near-future earth controlled by a male-dominated ruling class patterned loosely after the corporate world of today. Duchamp has also published a number of short stories, and is an editor for Aqueduct Press. Lisa Goldstein is another well respected feminist sf author. The novelette \"Dark Rooms\" (2007) is one of her better known works, and another one of her novels, \"The Uncertain Places\", won the Mythopoeic Award for Best Adult Novel in 2012.\nRecurrent themes.\nWorks of feminist science fiction are often similar in the goals they work towards as well as the subjects and plotlines they focus on in order to achieve those goals. Feminist science fiction is science fiction that carries across feminist ideals and the promotion of societal values such as gender equality, and the elimination of patriarchal oppression. Feminist science fiction works often present tropes that are recurrent across science fiction with an emphasis on gender relations and gender roles. Many elements of science fiction, such as cyborgs and implants, as well as utopias and dystopias, are given context in a gendered environment, providing a real contrast with present-day gender relations while remaining a work of science fiction.\nUtopian and dystopian societies.\nRepresentations of utopian and dystopian societies in feminist science fiction place an increased emphasis on gender roles while countering the anti-utopian philosophies of the 20th century. Male philosophers such as John Rawls, Isaiah Berlin, and Michael Oakeshott often criticize the idea of utopia, theorizing that it would be impossible to establish a utopia without violence and hegemony. Many male authored works of science fiction as well as threads of philosophical utopian thought dismiss utopias as something unattainable, whereas in feminist science fiction, utopian society is often presented as something both achievable and desirable.\nAnti-utopian philosophies and feminist science fiction come to odds in the possibility of achieving utopia. In \"Rehabilitating Utopia: Feminist Science Fiction and Finding the Ideal\", an article published in Contemporary Justice Review, philosophers against the dream of utopia argue that \"First is the expectation that utopia justifies violence, second is the expectation that utopia collapses individual desires into one communal norm, and third is the expectation that utopia mandates a robotic focus on problem-solving.\" In feminist science fiction, utopias are often realized through a communal want for an ideal society. One such novel is summarized in the aforementioned article, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's novel \"Herland\", in which \"Gilman perfectly captures the utopian impulse that all problems are solvable. She establishes a society where every consideration about a question aims for the rational answer.\" Gilman's utopia is presented as something attainable and achievable without conflict, neither enabling violence nor extinguishing individualism.\nIn the Parable series by feminist science fiction novelist Octavia Butler, anti-utopian philosophies are criticized via a dystopian setting. In the first novel, \"Parable of the Sower\", following the destruction of her home and family, Lauren Olamina, one of many who live in a dystopian, ungoverned society, seeks to form her own utopian religion entitled 'Earthseed'. Olamina's utopian creation does not justify the use of violence as a means, no matter how expedient, to justify the end, achieving utopia, no matter how desirable. Yet we witness that she cannot avoid violence, as it results from little more than promulgating ideas different from those held by the majority of those living within the current social structure, however disorganized and ungoverned that social structure may be. Butler posits that utopian society can never be achieved as an entity entirely separate from the outside world, one of the more commonly held beliefs about conditions necessary to achieve utopia. Olamina's, and Butler's, utopia is envisioned as a community with a shared vision that is not forced on all within it.\nOne common trend in feminist science fiction utopias is the existence of utopian worlds as single-gendered \u2013 most commonly female, an early example being Em\u00edlia Freitas\u2019s 1899 novel \"A Rainha do Ignoto\". In literary works female utopias are portrayed as free of conflict, and intentionally free of men. The single gendered utopias of female science fiction are free of the conflicts that feminism aims to eliminate, such as patriarchal oppression and the gender inequality inherent in patriarchal society. In a statement about these single gendered utopias, Joanna Russ, author of \"The Female Man\" , theorized that male-only societies were not written because in patriarchal society, male oppression is not as pressing an issue as is female oppression.\nUtopia as an ideal to strive for is not a concept wholly limited to feminist science fiction, however many non-feminist science fiction works often dismiss utopia as an unachievable goal, and as such, believe that pursuits for utopia should be considered dangerous and barren. Anti-utopian theory focuses on the 'how' in the transition from present society to a utopian future. In feminist science fiction, the achievement of a utopian future depends on the ability to recognize the need for improvement and the perseverance to overcome the obstacles present in creating a utopian society.\nRepresentation of women.\nPerhaps the most obvious attraction of science fiction to women writers \u2013 feminist or not \u2013 is the possibilities it offers for the creation of a female hero. The demands of realism in the contemporary or historical novel set limits which do not bind the universes available to science fiction. Although the history of science fiction reveals few heroic, realistic, or even original images of women, the genre had a potential recognized by the women writers drawn to it in the 1960s and 1970s. Before this time, the appeal for women writers was not that great. The impact of feminism on the science fiction field can be observed not only in science fiction texts themselves, but also on the development of feminist approaches to science fiction criticism and history, as well as conversations and debates in the science fiction community. One of the main debates is about the representation of women in science fiction.\nIn her article \"Redefining Women's Power through Feminist Science Fiction\", Maria DeRose suggests that, \"One of the great early socialists said that the status of women in a society is a pretty reliable index of the degree of civilization of that society. If this is true, then the very low status of women in science fiction should make us ponder about whether science fiction is civilized at all\". The women's movement has made most of us conscious of the fact that Science Fiction has totally ignored women. This \"lack of appreciation\" is the main reason that women are rebelling and actively fighting to be noticed in the field anyway.\nVirginia Wolf relates to this aspect of feminist science fiction in the article \"Feminist Criticism and Science Fiction for Children\". As she discusses the scarcity of women in the field, she states, \"During the first period, that of the nineteenth century, apparently only two women wrote Science Fiction, Mary Shelley and Rhoda Broughton,\" and continues, \"In the early twentieth century, a few women were successful Science Fiction writers\". But, \"The times changed. Repression gave way to questioning and outright rebellion, and in the Science Fiction of the 1960s stylistic innovations and new concerns emerged 'Many of their stories, instead of dealing with the traditional hardware of science fiction, concentrated on the effects that different societies or perceptions would have on individual characters'\". Andre Norton, a semi-well known analyst of Science fiction argues along these lines as well. As Norton explored one or more novels she came across, she realized that the creation of characters and how they are shown is a clear connection to the real world situation. From here, she goes in depth of characters in these feminist novels and relates them to the real world. She concludes here article along these lines. She wanted to get the idea out that feminists have a way to get their voice out there. Now, all their works are famous/ popular enough for their ideas to be let out. Virginia Wolf can attest to this fact. She introduced the idea that women were not represented well in the field till the early 1900s and added to the fact by stating, \"Women are not represented well in Science Fiction\".\nIndividual characters, as we come to know, have their own perception and observation of their surroundings. Characters in novels such as \"The Girl Who Was Plugged In\" by James Tiptree and Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale\" are fully aware of the situation at hand and their role in society. This idea is a continuation of the argument presented by Andre Norton. Wolf argues the same point in her analysis of Le Guin's writing, who has many contributions to the works of feminist Science Fiction. Wolf argues, \"What matters to Le Guin is not what people look like or how they behave but whether or not they have choice and whether or not they receive respect for who they are and what they do rather than on the basis of sex. Feminism is for her not a matter of how many women (or characters in Science Fiction) are housewives but a part of our hope for survival, which she believes lies in the search for balance and integration\". This stirs up many questions about equality (a debate which has been going on for many years) but nobody seems to have an answer. In this continual search for equality, many characters find themselves asking the same question: \"Is Gender Necessary\" (which is, coincidentally, one of Le Guin's novels and also another problem arising from gender biases). Robin Roberts, an American literary historian, addresses the link of these characters and what that means for our society today. Roberts believes that men and women would like to be equal, but are not equal. They should be fighting the same battle when in fact they are fighting each other. She also debates that gender equality has been a problem in every reach of feminism, not just in feminist science fiction. Wolf also tackles this problem, \"As she explains in \"Is Gender Necessary?\", \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" convinced her that if men and women were completely and genuinely equal in their social roles, equal legally and economically, equal in freedom, in responsibility, and in self-esteem, ... our central problem would not be the one it is now: the problem of exploitation\u2014exploitation of the woman, of the weak, of the earth' (p.\u00a0159)\". Science fiction criticism has come a long way from its defensive desire to create a canon. All of these authors demonstrate that science fiction criticism tackles the same questions as other literary criticism: race, gender, and the politics of Feminism itself. Wolf believes that evaluating primarily American texts, written over the past one hundred and twenty years, these critics locate science fiction's merits in its speculative possibilities. At the same time, however, all note that the texts they analyze reflect the issues and concerns of the historical period in which the literature was written. DeRose introduces her article with, in effect, the same argument. She says, \"the power of women in Science Fiction has greatly depreciated in the past few years\".\nGender identity.\nFeminist science fiction offers authors the opportunity to imagine worlds and futures in which women are not bound by the standards, rules, and roles that exist in reality. Rather, the genre creates a space in which the gender binary might be troubled and different sexualities may be explored.\nAs Anna Gilarek explains, issues of gender have been a part of feminist discourse throughout the feminist movement, and the work of authors such as Joanna Russ and Marge Piercy explore and expose gender based oppression. Gilarek outlines two approaches to social critique via Feminist SF: the use of fantastical elements such as \"invented worlds, planets, moons, and lands\", used to call attention to the ills of society by exaggerating them, or a more straightforward approach, \"relying on realist techniques to convey the message about the deficiencies of our world and its social organization, in particular the continued inequality of women\". There are many examples of redefined gender roles and gender identity found in Feminist SF, ranging from the inversion of gendered oppression to the amplification of gender stereotypes and tropes. In the short story \"The Matter of Seggri\", by Ursula Le Guin, traditional gender roles are completely swapped. Men are relegated to roles of athletes and prostitutes while women control the means of production and have exclusive access to education. In Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale\", gendered oppression is exaggerated in a dystopian society in which women's rights are stripped away and fertile women are relegated to the roles of handmaids who will bear children to further the human race. New books continue the dystopian theme of women living in a society which conforms to the wishes of men, at the expense of women's rights and well-being, such as in Louise O'Neill's young adult novel \"Only Ever Yours\". In this work, females are no longer born naturally but are genetically designed before birth to conform to the physical desires of men, then placed in a school in which they are taught not to think (they are never taught to read), and to focus on appearance until they are rated by beauty on a scale at age sixteen, with the top ten becoming the brides of elite men, the middle ten forced into concubinage, and the bottom ten forced to continue their lives as instructors at the school in very humiliating circumstances. At age forty, the women are euthanized. In the post-apocalyptic novel, \"Gather the Daughters\", by Jennie Melamed, females living in an island society are sexually exploited from the time they are girls, are forced to marry at adolescence, and after they become grandmothers must commit suicide.\nOver the decades, SF and feminist SF authors have taken different approaches to criticizing gender and gendered society. Helen Merrick outlines the transition from what Joanna Russ describes as the \"Battle of the Sexes\" tradition to a more egalitarian or androgynous approach. Also known as the \"Dominant Woman\" stories, the \"Battle of the Sexes\" stories often present matriarchal societies in which women have overcome their patriarchal oppressors and have achieved dominance. These stories are representative of an anxiety that perceives women's power as a threat to masculinity and the heterosexual norm. As Merrick explains, \"And whilst they may at least hint at the vision of a more equal gendered social order, this possibility is undermined by figuring female desire for greater equality in terms of a (stereotypical) masculine drive for power and domination.\" Examples of these types of stories, written in the 1920s and 30s through the 50s, include Francis Steven's \"Friend Island\" and Margaret Rupert's \"Via the Hewitt Ray\"; in 1978, Marion Zimmer Bradley released \"The Ruins of Isis\", a novel about a futuristic matriarchy on a human colony planet where the men are extremely oppressed.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, feminist SF authors shifted from the \"Battle of the Sexes\" writing more egalitarian stories and stories that sought to make the feminine more visible. Ursula Le Guin's \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" portrayed an androgynous society in which a world without gender could be imagined. In James Tiptree Jr.'s short story \"Houston, Houston, Do You Read?\", women are able to be seen in their full humanity due to the absence of men in a post-apocalyptic society. Joanna Russ's works, including \"When it Changed\" and \"The Female Man\" are other examples of exploring femininity and a \"deconstruction of the acceptable, liberal 'whole' woman towards a multiple, shifting postmodernist sense of female 'selfhood'\".\nComic books and graphic novels.\nFeminist science fiction is evidenced in the globally popular mediums of comic books, manga, and graphic novels. One of the first appearances of a strong female character was that of the superhero Wonder Woman, co-created by husband and wife team William Moulton Marston and Elizabeth Holloway Marston. In December 1941, Wonder Woman came to life on the pages of \"All Star Comics\", and in the intervening years has been reincarnated in from animated TV series to live-action films, with significant cultural impact. By the early 1960s, Marvel Comics already contained some strong female characters, although they often suffered from stereotypical female weakness such as fainting after intense exertion. By the 1970s and 1980s, true female heroes started to emerge on the pages of comics. This was helped by the emergence of self-identified feminist writers including Ann Nocenti, Linda Fite, and Barbara Kesel. As female visibility in comics increased, the \"fainting heroine\" type began to fade into the past. However, some female comic book writers, such as Gail Simone, believe that female characters are still relegated to plot devices (see \"Women in Refrigerators\").\nFeminism in science fiction sh\u014djo manga has been a theme in the works of Moto Hagio among others, for whom the writings of Ursula K. Le Guin have been a major influence.\nFilm and television.\nFeminism has driven the creation of a considerable body of action-oriented science fiction with female protagonists: Wonder Woman (originally created in 1941) and \"The Bionic Woman\" during the time of the organized women's movement in the 1970s; \"\" and the \"Alien tetralogy\" in the 1980s; and \"Xena, Warrior Princess\", comic book character \"Red Sonja\", and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". 2001 science fiction TV series \"Dark Angel\" featured a powerful female protagonist, with gender roles between her and the main male character generally reversed.\nHowever, feminists have also created science fiction that directly engages with feminism beyond the creation of female action heroes. Television and film have offered opportunities for expressing new ideas about social structures and the ways feminists influence science. Feminist science fiction provides a means to challenge the norms of society and suggest new standards for how societies view gender. The genre also deals with male/female categories, showing how female roles can differ from feminine roles. Hence feminism influences the film industry by creating new ways of exploring and looking at masculinity/femininity and male/female roles. A contemporary example of feminist science fiction television can be found in \"Orphan Black\", which deals with issues of reproductive justice, science, gender, and sexuality.\nFandom.\nBy the 1970s, the science fiction community was confronting questions of feminism and sexism within science fiction culture itself. Multiple Hugo-winning fan writer and professor of literature Susan Wood and others organized the \"feminist panel\" at the 1976 World Science Fiction Convention against considerable resistance. Reactions to the appearance of feminists among fannish ranks led indirectly to the creation of \"A Women's APA\" and WisCon.\nFeminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.\nPublications.\nIn the 1970s, the first feminist science fiction publications were created. The most well-known are fanzines \"The Witch and the Chameleon\" (1974\u20131976) and \"Janus\" (1975\u20131980), which later became \"Aurora SF\" (Aurora Speculative Feminism) (1981\u20131987). Windhaven, \"A Journal of Feminist Science Fiction\" was published from 1977 to 1979 by Jessica Amanda Salmonson in Seattle. Special issues of magazines linked to science fiction meetings were also published at that moment, like the Khatru symposium's fanzine \"Women in Science Fiction\" in 1975.\nCritical works.\n\"Femspec\".\n\"Femspec\" is a feminist academic journal specializing in works that challenge gender through speculative genres, including science fiction, fantasy, magical realism, mythic explorations in poetry and post-modern fiction, and horror. There is a conscious multicultural focus of the journal, both in content and in the diverse makeup of its editorial group. The first issue came out in 1999 under the editorial direction of founder Batya Weinbaum, who is still the Editor-in-Chief. \"Femspec\" is still publishing and has brought over 1000 authors, critics and artists into print. Having lost their academic home in May 2003, they increasingly cross genres and print write-ups of all books and media received, as well as of events that feature creative works that imaginatively challenge gender such as intentional communities, performance events, and film festivals."}
{"id": "11258", "revid": "34413366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11258", "title": "Fellatio", "text": "Fellatio (also known as fellation, and in slang as blowjob, BJ, giving head, or sucking off) is an oral sex act consisting of the stimulation of a penis by using the mouth. Oral stimulation of the scrotum may also be termed \"fellatio\", or colloquially as \"teabagging\". \nIt may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay before other sexual activities, such as vaginal or anal intercourse, or as an erotic and physically intimate act of its own. Fellatio creates a risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but the risk is significantly lower than that of vaginal or anal sex, especially for HIV transmission.\nMost countries do not have laws banning the practice of fellatio, though some cultures may consider it taboo. People may also refrain from engaging in fellatio due to personal preference, negative feelings, or sexual inhibitions. Commonly, people do not view oral sex as affecting the virginity of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary.\nEtymology.\nThe English noun \"fellatio\" comes from the Latin ', the past participle of the verb ', meaning \"to suck\". In \"fellatio\", the \"-us\" is replaced by the \"-io\" while the declension stem ends in \"-ion-\", which gives the suffix the form \"-ion\" (cf. French \"fellation\"). The \"-io\"(\"n\") ending is used in English to create nouns from Latin adjectives and it can indicate a state or action wherein the Latin verb is being, or has been, performed.\nFurther English words have been created based on the same Latin root. A person who performs fellatio upon another (i.e. who \"fellates\") may be termed a \"fellator.\" Latin's gender based declension means this word may be restricted to describing a male. The equivalent term for a female is \"fellatrix\".\nPractice.\nGeneral.\nThe essential aspect of fellatio is oral stimulation of the penis (including the shaft and glans) through sucking with the mouth, use of the tongue for licking, using the lips, or some combination. One method is the sex partner taking the penis into the mouth and moving smoothly up and down to a rhythm while being careful to avoid contact with the teeth. Fellatio also includes oral stimulation of the scrotum, whether licking, sucking or taking the entire scrotum into the mouth. During the act, orgasm may be achieved and semen may be ejaculated into the partner's mouth. When the penis is thrust into someone's mouth, it is called \"irrumatio\", though the term is rarely used.\nPerforming fellatio can trigger the gag reflex. \nIt is physically possible for men with sufficient flexibility, penis size, or both, to perform fellatio on themselves as a form of masturbation, in an act called autofellatio. However, few men possess the flexibility and penis length to safely perform the necessary frontbend.\nDeposition of semen.\nDuring fellatio, a partner may ingest semen from the penis. As late as 1976, some doctors were advising women in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy not to swallow semen lest it induce premature labor, but it was later determined to be safe.\nThe receiver of fellatio typically becomes sexually aroused. Once the prerequisite level of sexual stimulation has been achieved and ejaculation becomes imminent, the semen may be discharged onto his partner. The male may position his penis prior to ejaculation so that semen will be deposited onto his partner's face (known as a \"facial\"), or other body part such as their neck, chest or breast.\nDeep-throating.\nDeep-throating is a sexual act in which a person takes a partner's entire erect penis into the mouth and throat. The technique and term became popularized by the 1972 pornographic film \"Deep Throat\". For deep-throating, the penis must be long enough so that it can reach the back of the receiver's throat.\nDeep-throating can be difficult because of the natural gag reflex that is triggered when the soft palate is touched. People have different sensitivities to this reflex. With practice, some learn to suppress it. Deep-throating leads to a different kind of sexual stimulation of the penis than regular fellatio: the tongue's movement is restricted during deep-throating and sucking becomes impossible; the tightness of the pharynx can intensely stimulate the glans of the penis.\nOther aspects.\nThe male receiving fellatio receives direct sexual stimulation, while his partner may derive satisfaction from giving him pleasure. Giving and receiving fellatio may happen simultaneously in sex positions like 69 and daisy chain.\nFellatio is sometimes practiced when vaginal or anal penetration would create a physical difficulty for a sex partner. For example, it may be practiced during pregnancy instead of vaginal intercourse by couples wishing to engage in intimate sexual activity while avoiding the difficulty of vaginal intercourse during later stages of pregnancy.\nOther reasons why a woman may not wish to have vaginal intercourse include apprehension of losing her virginity or of becoming pregnant, or because she may be menstruating.\nHealth aspects.\nSexually transmitted infections.\nChlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be transmitted through oral sex. Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.\nThere is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on their genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in their mouth, or bleeding gums. Brushing the teeth, flossing, or undergoing dental work soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are microscopic, increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of condoms or other effective barrier methods when performing or receiving fellatio with a partner whose STI status is unknown.\nHPV and oral cancer link.\nLinks have been reported between oral sex and oral cancer with HPV-infected people.\nA 2007 study suggested a correlation between oral sex and throat cancer. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.\nPregnancy and semen exposure.\nFellatio cannot result in pregnancy, as there is no way for ingested sperm to reach the uterus and fallopian tubes to fertilize an egg cell. At any rate, acids in the stomach and digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract break down and kill spermatozoa.\nClinical research has tentatively linked fellatio with immune modulation, indicating it may reduce the chance of complications during pregnancy. The potentially fatal complication pre-eclampsia was observed to occur less in women who regularly engaged in fellatio, with those who also ingested their partner's semen being at the least risk. The results were consistent with the fact that semen contains TGF-\u03b21, the exchange of which between partners has a causal reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia caused by an immunological reaction. However, fellatio is not the only viable mechanism for the transmission of TGF-\u03b21.\nCultural views.\nVirginity.\nOral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving virginity, especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed \"technical virginity\" (which additionally includes anal sex, manual sex and other non-penetrative sex acts, but excludes penile-vaginal sex). The concept of \"technical virginity\" or sexual abstinence through oral sex is particularly popular among teenagers in the United States, including with regard to teenage girls who not only fellate their boyfriends to preserve their virginities, but also to create and maintain intimacy or to avoid pregnancy. Other reasons given for the practice among teenage girls are peer-group pressure and as their introduction to sexual activity. Additionally, gay males may regard fellatio as a way of maintaining their virginities, with penile-anal penetration defined as resulting in virginity loss, while other gay males may define fellatio as their main form of sexual activity.\nLegality.\nFellatio is legal in most countries. Laws of some jurisdictions regard fellatio as penetrative sex for the purposes of sexual offenses with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice, in contrast to anal sex or extramarital sex. In Islamic literature, the only forms of sexual activity that are consistently explicitly prohibited within marriage are anal sex and sexual activity during menstruation. However, the exact attitude towards oral sex is a subject of disagreements between modern scholars of Islam. Authorities considering it \"objectionable\" do so because of the penis' supposedly impure fluids coming in contact with the mouth. Others emphasize that there is no decisive evidence to forbid oral sex.\nIn Malaysia, fellatio is illegal, but the law is seldom enforced. Under Malaysia's Section 377A of the Penal Code, the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of another person is considered a \"carnal intercourse against the order of nature\" and is punishable with imprisonment of 20 years maximum and whipping.\nTradition.\nGalienus called fellatio \"lesbiari\" since women of the island of Lesbos were supposed to have introduced the practice of using one's lips to give sexual pleasure.\nThe Ancient Indian \"Kama Sutra\", dating from the first century AD, describes oral sex, discussing fellatio in great detail (the \"Kama Sutra\" has a chapter on (or ), \"mouth congress\") and only briefly mentioning cunnilingus. However, according to the \"Kama Sutra\", fellatio is above all a characteristic of eunuchs (or, according to other translations, of effeminate homosexuals or trans women similar to the modern Hijra of India), who use their mouths as a substitute for female genitalia.\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana, the author of the \"Kama Sutra\", states that it is also practiced by \"unchaste women\", but mentions that there are widespread traditional concerns about this being a degrading or unclean practice, with known practitioners being evaded as love partners in large parts of the country. The author appears to somewhat agree with these attitudes, claiming that \"a wise man\" should not engage in that form of intercourse while acknowledging that it can be appropriate in some unspecified cases.\nThe Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted fellatio in their ceramics.\nIn some cultures, such as Cambodia, Chinese in Southeast Asia, northern Manchu tribes along Amur River, Sambians in Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Telugus of India, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, briefly taking the penis of a male infant or toddler into one's mouth was considered a nonsexual form of affection or even a form of ritual, greeting, respect, parenting love, or lifesaving. According to some sources, it was an ancient Chinese custom for grandmothers, mothers, and elder sisters to calm their baby boys with fellatio. It has also been reported that some modern Chinese mothers have performed fellatio to their moribund sons as affection and means for lifesaving, because they culturally believe that when the penis is completely retracted into the abdomen, the boy or man will die.\nOther animals.\nFlying foxes (a type of bat) have been observed engaging in oral sex. Indian flying fox males will lick a female's vulva both before and after copulation, with the length of pre-copulation cunnilingus positively correlated with length of copulation. The fruit bat \"Cynopterus sphinx\", has been observed to engage in fellatio during mating. Pairs spend more time copulating if the female licks the male than if she does not. Male Livingstone's fruit bats have been observed engaging in homosexual fellatio, although it is unknown if this is an example of sexual behavior or social grooming. Bonin flying foxes also engage in homosexual fellatio, but the behavior has been observed independently of social grooming."}
{"id": "11259", "revid": "46370372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11259", "title": "Fatwa", "text": "A fatwa (; ; ; ) is a legal ruling on a point of Islamic law (sharia) given by a qualified Islamic jurist (\"faqih\") in response to a question posed by a private individual, judge or government. A jurist issuing fatwas is called a \"mufti\", and the act of issuing fatwas is called ifta'. Fatwas have played an important role throughout Islamic history, taking on new forms in the modern era.\nResembling \"jus respondendi\" in Roman law and rabbinic \"responsa\", privately issued fatwas historically served to inform Muslim populations about Islam, advise courts on difficult points of Islamic law, and elaborate substantive law. In later times, public and political fatwas were issued to take a stand on doctrinal controversies, legitimize government policies or articulate grievances of the population. During the era of mass European/Christian invasions, fatwas played a part in mobilizing resistance against foreign aggressors.\nMuftis acted as independent scholars in the classical legal system. Over the centuries, Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, while Shia jurists in Iran asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era.\nIn the modern era, fatwas have reflected changing economic, social and political circumstances, and addressed concerns arising in varied Muslim communities. The spread of codified state laws and Western-style legal education in the modern Muslim world has displaced muftis from their traditional role of clarifying and elaborating the laws applied in courts. Instead, modern fatwas have increasingly served to advise the general public on other aspects of sharia, particularly questions regarding religious rituals and everyday life. Modern public fatwas have addressed and sometimes sparked controversies in the Muslim world, and some fatwas in recent decades have gained worldwide notoriety. The legal methodology of modern \"ifta\" often diverges from pre-modern practice, particularly so in the West. Emergence of modern media and universal education has transformed the traditional institution of \"ifta\" in various ways. While the proliferation of contemporary fatwas attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims, little research has been done to determine how much these fatwas affect the beliefs or behavior of the Muslim public.\nTerminology.\nThe word \"fatwa\" comes from the Arabic root \"f-t-w\", whose meanings include 'youth, newness, clarification, explanation'. A number of terms related to \"fatwa\" derive from the same root. A jurist issuing fatwas is called a \"mufti\". The person who asks for a fatwa is known as \"mustafti\". The act of issuing fatwas is called \"ift\u0101\u02be\". The term \"futy\u0101\" refers to soliciting and issuing fatwas.\nIn older English language works the spelling fetva, from Turkish, is used, relating to the Ottoman Empire.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the \"fatwa\" can be traced back to the Quran. On a number of occasions, the Quranic text instructs the Islamic prophet Muhammad how to respond to questions from his followers regarding religious and social practices. Several of these verses begin with the phrase \"When they ask you concerning ..., say ...\" In two cases (4:127, 4:176) this is expressed with verbal forms of the root \"f-t-y\", which signify asking for or giving an authoritative answer. In the hadith literature, this three-way relationship between God, Muhammad, and believers, is typically replaced by a two-way consultation, in which Muhammad replies directly to queries from his Companions (\"sahaba\").\nAccording to Islamic doctrine, with Muhammad's death in 632, God ceased to communicate with mankind through revelation and prophets. At that point, the rapidly expanding Muslim community turned to Muhammad's Companions, as the most authoritative voices among them, for religious guidance, and some of them are reported to have issued pronouncements on a wide range of subjects. The generation of Companions was in turn replaced in that role by the generation of Successors (\"tabi'un\"). The concept of fatwa thus developed in Islamic communities under a question-and-answer format for communicating religious knowledge, and took on its definitive form with development of the classical theory of Islamic law.\nIn pre-modern Islam.\nProcess of \"ift\u0101\u02be\".\nThe legal theory of the fatwa was formulated in the classical texts of \"usul al-fiqh\" (principles of jurisprudence), while more practical guidelines for muftis were found in manuals called \"adab al-mufti\" or \"adab al-fatwa\" (etiquette of the mufti/fatwa).\nFatwas are issued in response to a query. They can range from a simple yes/no answer to a book-length treatise. A short fatwa may state a well-known point of law in response to a question from a lay person, while a \"major\" fatwa may give a judgment on an unprecedented case, detailing the legal reasoning behind the decision. Queries to muftis were supposed to address real and not hypothetical situations and be formulated in general terms, leaving out names of places and people. Since a mufti was not supposed to inquire into the situation beyond the information included in the query, queries regarding contentious matters were often carefully constructed to elicit the desired response. A mufti's understanding of the query commonly depended on their familiarity with local customs and colloquialisms. In theory, if the query was unclear or not sufficiently detailed for a ruling, the mufti was supposed to state these caveats in their response.\nFatwas were solicited by men and women from all social classes. A mufti could be an obscure scholar, who occasionally replied to queries from people in his neighborhood, or, at the other extreme, a famous jurist or a powerful state official. The level of technical detail supplied in a fatwa, such as citations of sources or specification of legal methodologies employed, depended on the technical level of the petitioner. In theory, a petitioner was supposed to verify the mufti's scholarly reputation, but mufti manuals (\"adab al-mufti\") recognized that it would be difficult for a lay person to do so, and advised the petitioner to trust their sense of the mufti's piety and ideally follow the advice of a single scholar known for exemplary morals. The mufti was often a well-known figure in his neighborhood. Some petitioners could choose among several local muftis, while others had to or chose to travel to receive a fatwa. Judges commonly sent letters to solicit fatwas from prominent jurists in another town or even country. Sunni legal theory generally permits the petioner to obtain a fatwa from multiple jurists on the same query, provided that it addresses a real and not hypothetical situation. Some petitioners sought out a second fatwa because they were unsatisfied with the first, and the two sides in a legal dispute generally each sought to obtain a fatwa that would support their position. Muftis often consulted another mufti on difficult cases, though this practice was not foreseen by legal theory, which saw \"futya\" as a transaction between one qualified jurist and one \"unqualified\" petitioner.\nIn theory, a mufti was expected to issue fatwas free of charge. In practice, muftis commonly received support from the public treasury, public endowments or private donations. Taking of bribes was forbidden. Until the 11th or 12th century, the vast majority of jurists held other jobs to support themselves. These were generally lower- and middle-class professions such as tanning, manuscript copying or small trade.\nIn theory, fatwas could be delivered orally or in writing, but it is not clear how common oral fatwas were, aside from those issued by an Ottoman office established specifically for the purpose of issuing oral fatwas. Many routine, written fatwas were delivered directly to the petitioner on the piece of paper containing the query, leaving no documentary trace. However, large collections of ordinary fatwas are preserved in Ottoman and Indian archives. Mufti manuals contained a number of regulations about the standard format of a fatwa, such as avoiding blank space that could be used for a spurious addition and concluding the fatwa with an expression like \"allahu a'lam\" (God knows best). Nonetheless, fatwas took on a variety of forms depending on the local legal culture.\nThe 14th century jurist Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya was known for his methodology of issuing \"fatwas\" through direct research of the \"Qur'an\" and \"Hadith\", rather than being restrained by the mechanism of the \"madhhabs\" (legal schools). Explaining Ibn Taymiyya's approach to issue \"fatwas\", his student Al-Dhahabi writes: \"He was well informed of the legal views of the [Prophet's] companions and their followers, and he rarely talked about a subject without quoting the four schools of the imams. Yet, he contradicted the four schools in well-known matters about which he wrote and for which provided arguments from the Koran and the Sunna. He has compiled a work entitled \"Politics According to Divine Law for Establishing Order for Sovereign and Subjects\" and a book [called] \"Removing the Reproach from the Learned Imams\"... For some years now he has not issued \"fatwas\" (legal opinions) according to a specific school, rather he bases these on the proof he has ascertained himself. He supported the pure Sunna and the way of Salafiyah\".\nRole of fatwas.\nThe classical institution of fatwa is similar to \"jus respondendi\" in Roman law and the \"responsa\" in Jewish law.\nFatwas have played three important roles in the classical legal system:\nBefore the rise of modern education, the study of law was a centerpiece of advanced education in the Islamic world. A relatively small class of legal scholars controlled the interpretation of sharia on a wide range of questions essential to the society, ranging from ritual to finance. It was considered a requirement for qualified jurists to communicate their knowledge through teaching or issuing fatwas. The ideal mufti was conceived as an individual of scholarly accomplishments and exemplary morals, and muftis were generally approached with the respect and deference corresponding to these expectations.\nJudges generally sought an opinion from a mufti with higher scholarly authority than themselves for difficult cases or potentially controversial verdicts. Fatwas were routinely upheld in courts, and if a fatwa was disregarded, it was usually because another fatwa supporting a different position was judged to be more convincing. If a party in a dispute was not able to obtain a fatwa supporting their position, they would be unlikely to pursue their case in court, opting for informal mediation instead, or abandoning their claim altogether. Sometimes muftis could be petitioned for a fatwa relating to a court judgment that has already been passed, acting as an informal appeals process, but the extent of this practice and its mechanism varied across history. While in most of the Islamic world judges were not required to consult muftis by any political authority, in Muslim Spain this practice was mandatory, so that a judicial decision was considered invalid without prior approval by a legal specialist.\nAuthor-jurists collected fatwas by muftis of high scholarly reputation and abstracted them into concise formulations of legal norms that could be used by judges, giving a summary of jurisprudence for a particular \"madhhab\" (legal school). Author-jurists sought out fatwas that reflected the social conditions of their time and place, often opting for later legal opinions which were at variance with the doctrine of early authorities. Research by Wael Hallaq and Baber Johansen has shown that fatwa compilations could, and sometimes did, have a significant impact on the development of Islamic law.\nDuring the early centuries of Islam, the roles of mufti, author-jurist and judge were not mutually exclusive. A jurist could lead a teaching circle, conduct a fatwa session, and adjudicate court cases in a single day, devoting his night hours to writing a legal treatise. Those who were able to act in all four capacities were regarded as the most accomplished jurists.\nFrom the standpoint of morality and religious obligation, the term \"fatwa\" has been contrasted with \"taqwa\" (piety, fear of God), particularly in Sufi literature. Fatwas may allow a choice between lenient and strict interpretation of \"sharia\" on a certain matter, or they may employ legalistic stratagems (\"hiyal\") to circumvent a stricter interpretation, while such strategies may not be acceptable from the standpoint of \"taqwa\".\nQualifications of a mufti.\nThe basic prerequisite for issuing fatwas under the classical legal theory was religious knowledge and piety. According to the \"adab al-mufti\" manuals, a mufti must be an adult, Muslim, trusted and reliable, of good character and sound mind, an alert and rigorous thinker, trained as a jurist, and not a sinner. On a practical level, the stature of muftis derived from their reputation for scholarly expertise and upright character.\nAccording to legal theory, it was up to each mufti to decide when he was ready to practice. In practice, an aspiring jurist would normally study for several years with one or several recognized scholars, following a curriculum that included Arabic grammar, hadith, law and other religious sciences. The teacher would decide when the student was ready to issue fatwas by giving him a certificate (\"ijaza\").\nDuring the first centuries of Islam, it was assumed that a mufti was a \"mujtahid\", i.e., a jurist who is capable of deriving legal rulings directly from the scriptural sources through independent reasoning (\"ijtihad\"), evaluating the reliability of hadith and applying or even developing the appropriate legal methodologies. Starting from around 1200 CE, legal theorists began to accept that muftis of their time may not possess the knowledge and legal skill to perform this activity. In addition, it was felt that the major question of jurisprudence had already been addressed by master jurists of earlier times, so that later muftis only had to follow the legal opinions established within their legal school (\"taqlid\"). At that point, the notions of \"mufti\" and \"mujtahid\" became distinguished, and legal theorists classified jurists into three or more levels of competence.\nAmong Twelver Shia, the Akhbari school of jurisprudence, which was predominant for a time during the early modern era, hold a different view on \"ifta\" from the currently predominant Usuli school. According to the Usulis, fatwas can be based on valid conjecture (\"zann\") arrived through \"ijtihad\", and every Muslim who is not qualified to be a \"mujtahid\" should become a follower (\"muqallid\") of a \"mujtahid\". In contrast, Akhbaris hold that all Shia Muslims must be \"muqallids\" of the Twelve Imams, and that fatwas should reflect only knowledge that is certain (\"qat\u02bf\") and based on the traditions of the Imams.\nUnlike the post of \"qadi\", which is reserved for men in the classical sharia system, fatwas could be issued by qualified women as well as men. In practice, the vast majority of jurists who completed the lengthy curriculum in linguistic and religious sciences required to obtain the qualification to issue fatwas were men. Slaves and persons who were blind or mute were likewise theoretically barred from the post of a judge, but not that of mufti.\nFatwa vs. court judgment.\nThe mufti and the judge play different roles in the classical sharia system, with corresponding differences between a fatwa and a \"qada\" (court decision):\nInstitutions.\nBefore the 11th century CE, anyone who possessed scholarly recognition as an Islamic jurist could issue fatwas. Starting around that time, however, the public office of mufti began to appear alongside the private issuing of fatwas. In Khurasan, the rulers appointed a head of the local ulama, called \"shaykh al-Islam\", who also functioned as the chief mufti. The Mamluks appointed four muftis, one for each of the four Sunni madhhabs, to appellate courts in provincial capitals. The Ottomans organized muftis into a hierarchical bureaucracy with a chief mufti of the empire called \"shaykh al-Islam\" at the top. The Ottoman \"shaykh al-Islam\" (Turk. \"\u015feyh\u00fclislam\"), was among the most powerful state officials. Scribes reviewed queries directed to Ottoman muftis and rewrote them to facilitate issuing of fatwas. In Mughal India and Safavid Iran the chief mufti had the title of \"sadr\".\nFor the first few centuries of Islam, muftis were educated in informal study circles, but beginning in the 11th and 12th centuries, the ruling elites began to establish institutions of higher religious learning known as madrasas in an effort to secure support and cooperation of the \"ulema\" (religious scholars). Madrasas, which were primarily devoted to the study of law, soon multiplied throughout the Islamic world, helping to spread Islamic learning beyond urban centers and to unite diverse Islamic communities in a shared cultural project.\nIn some states, such as Muslim Spain, muftis were assigned to courts in advisory roles. In Muslim Spain jurists also sat on a \"shura\" (council) advising the ruler. Muftis were additionally appointed to other public functions, such as market inspectors.\nIn Shia Islam.\nWhile the office of the mufti was gradually subsumed into the state bureaucracy in much of the Sunni Muslim world, Shia religious establishment followed a different path in Iran starting from the early modern era. During Safavid rule, independent Islamic jurists (\"mujtahids\") claimed the authority to represent the hidden imam. Under the Usuli doctrine that prevailed among Twelver Shias in the 18th century and under the Qajar dynasty, the \"mujtahids\" further claimed to act collectively as deputies of the imam. According to this doctrine, every Muslim is supposed to choose and follow a high-ranking living \"mujtahid\" bearing the title of \"marja' al-taqlid\", whose fatwas are considered binding, unlike fatwas in Sunni Islam. Thus, in contrast to Sunni muftis, Shia \"mujtahids\" gradually achieved increasing independence from the state.\nPublic and political fatwas.\nWhile most fatwas were delivered to an individual or a judge, some fatwas that were public or political in nature played an important role in religious legitimation, doctrinal disputes, political criticism, or political mobilization. As muftis were progressively incorporated into government bureaucracies in the course of Islamic history, they were often expected to support government policies. Ottoman sultans regularly sought fatwas from the chief mufti for administrative and military initiatives, including fatwas sanctioning jihad against Mamluk Egypt and Safavid Iran. Fatwas by the Ottoman chief mufti were also solicited by the rulers to lend religious legitimacy to new social and economic practices, such as financial and penal laws enacted outside of sharia, printing of nonreligious books (1727) and vaccination (1845).\nAt other times muftis wielded their influence independently of the ruler, and several sultans in Morocco and the Ottoman Empire were dethroned as a result of fatwas issued by influential jurists. This happened, for example, to the Ottoman sultan Murad V on the grounds of his insanity. Public fatwas were also used to dispute doctrinal matters, and in some case to proclaim that certain groups or individuals who professed to be Muslim were to be excluded from the Islamic community (a practice known as \"takfir\"). In both political and scholarly sphere, doctrinal controversies between different states, denominations or centers of learning were accompanied by dueling fatwas. Muftis also acted to counteract the influence of judges and secular functionaries. By articulating grievances and legal rights of the population, public fatwas often prompted an otherwise unresponsive court system to provide redress.\nIn the modern era.\nAnti-colonial fatwas.\nEarly in the era of Western colonialism, several fatwas were issued drawing on the classical legal distinction between lands under Islamic rule (\"dar al-Islam\") and lands of war (\"dar al-harb\") or unbelief (\"dar al-kufr\"). These fatwas classified countries under European domination as lands of war or unbelief and invoked the legal theory obliging Muslims to wage war against the rulers of these lands or emigrate. A number of such fatwas were issued during the 19th century, including in 1803 by Shah Abdul Aziz in India and in 1804 by Usman dan Fodio in West Africa. The unrealistic nature of these fatwas was soon recognized and in 1870 the \"ulama\" of northern India issued fatwas stating that Indian Muslims were not obliged to rebel or emigrate. A similar doctrinal controversy occurred in French-ruled Algeria. The fatwas solicited by the Algerian anti-colonial leader Abd al-Qadir differed in their technical detail, while the French authorities obtained fatwas from local muftis, stating that Muslims living under the rule of unbelievers were not obligated to fight or emigrate as long as they were granted religious freedom by the authorities.\nOn many other occasions, fatwas served as an effective tool for influencing the political process. For example, in 1904 a fatwa by Moroccan ulema achieved the dismissal of European experts hired by the Moroccan government, while in 1907 another Moroccan fatwa succeeded in deposing the sultan on accusation that he failed to mount a defense against French aggression. The 1891 tobacco protest fatwa by the Iranian \"mujtahid\" Mirza Shirazi, which prohibited smoking as long as the British tobacco monopoly was in effect, also achieved its goals.\nModern institutions.\nUnder European colonial rule, the institution of \"dar al-ifta\" was established in a number of madrasas (law colleges) as a centralized place for issuing of fatwas, and these organizations to a considerable extent replaced independent muftis as religious guides for the general population. Following independence, most Muslim states established national organizations devoted to issuing fatwas. One example is the Egyptian Dar al-Ifta, founded in 1895, which has served to articulate a national vision of Islam through fatwas issued in response to government and private queries. National governments in Muslim-majority countries also instituted councils of senior religious scholars to advise the government on religious matters and issue fatwas. These councils generally form part of the ministry for religious affairs, rather than the justice department, which may have a more assertive attitude toward the executive branch.\nWhile chief muftis of earlier times oversaw a hierarchy of muftis and judges applying traditional jurisprudence, most modern states have adopted European-influenced legal codes and no longer employ traditional judicial procedures or traditionally trained judges. State muftis generally promote a vision of Islam that is compatible with state law of their country.\nAlthough some early theorists argued that muftis should not respond to questions on certain subjects, such as theology, muftis have in practice handled queries relating to a wide range of subjects. This trend continued in modern times, and contemporary state-appointed muftis and institutions for \"ifta\" respond to government and private queries on varied issues, including political conflicts, Islamic finance, and medical ethics, contributing to shaping a national Islamic identity.\nThere exists no international Islamic authority to settle differences in interpretation of Islamic law. An International Islamic Fiqh Academy was created by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, but its legal opinions are not binding.\nLegal methodology.\nModern fatwas have been marked by an increased reliance on the process of \"ijtihad\", i.e. deriving legal rulings based on an independent analysis rather than conformity with the opinions of earlier legal authorities (\"taqlid\"). While in the past muftis were associated with a particular school of law (\"madhhab\"), in the 20th century many muftis began to assert their independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence.\nThe most notorious result of disregarding classical jurisprudence are the fatwas of militant extremists who have interpreted the Quran and hadith as supporting suicide bombings, indiscriminate killing of bystanders, and declaration of self-professed Muslims as unbelievers (\"takfir\").\nNew forms of ijtihad have also given rise to fatwas that support such notions as gender equality and banking interest, which are at variance with classical jurisprudence. This is commonly accomplished by application of various traditional legal doctrines such as the \"maqasid\" (objectives) of sharia, \"maslaha\" (public interest) and \"darura\" (necessity), in place of adhering to the letter of scriptural sources. The main argument for this approach is that Islamic law is meant to serve the interest of Muslims and make their lives easier (\"tays\u012br\"). This form of ijtihad is particularly prominent in \"fiqh al-aqall\u012by\u0101t\" (minority jurisprudence), a recently developed branch of Islamic jurisprudence that aims to address the needs of Muslims living in countries with a non-Muslim majority. Its opponents object that sharia is supposed to determine the interests of Muslims, and not the other way around.\nPolitical fatwas and controversies.\nOn November 14, 1914, the Ottoman sultan proclaimed a jihad to mark the official entry of the Ottoman Empire into World War I. The proclamation was supported by a fatwa issued by the Shaykh al-Islam. Contrary to the German hopes that the proclamation would trigger Muslim revolts in British and French colonies, it was either rejected or quietly ignored by their Muslim authorities. It also quickly gave rise to a heated academic debate in Europe. The controversy was sparked by a 1915 article by the prominent Dutch orientalist C. Snouck Hurgronje, titled \"Heilige Oorlog [Holy War] Made in Germany\". In it Hurgronje denounced his German colleagues, who he felt instigated the jihad proclamation in an irresponsible appeal to an antiquated concept that threatened the project of modernizing the Muslim world. The article was widely circulated in an English translation and its accuracy continues to be debated by historians, who acknowledge both the German influence and the internal political calculations of the Ottoman government underlying the proclamation.\nSeveral boycott fatwas were issued in modern times, such as the one issued by Iraqi ulema in 1933, calling on Muslims to boycott Zionist products. In 2004 Yusuf al-Qaradawi issued a fatwa calling for boycott of Israeli and American products, arguing that buying these goods would strengthen the \"enemy\" fighting against Muslims in the struggle over Palestine.\nSome muftis in the modern era, like the mufti of the Lebanese republic in the mid-20th century and the Grand Mufti of the Sultanate of Oman, were important political leaders. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini used proclamations and fatwas to introduce and legitimize a number of institutions, including the Council of the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian Parliament.\nKhomeini's most publicized fatwa was the proclamation condemning Salman Rushdie to death for his novel \"The Satanic Verses\". Khomeini himself did not call this proclamation a fatwa, and some scholars have argued that it did not qualify as one, since in Islamic legal theory only a court can decide whether an accused is guilty. However, after the proclamation was presented as a fatwa in Western press, this characterization was widely accepted by both its critics and its supporters, and the Rushdie Affair is credited with bringing the institution of fatwa to world attention. Together with later militant fatwas, it has contributed to the popular misconception of the fatwa as a religious death warrant.\nMany militant and reform movements in modern times have disseminated fatwas issued by individuals who do not possess the qualifications traditionally required of a mufti. A famous example is the fatwa issued in 1998 by Osama bin Laden and four of his associates, proclaiming \"jihad against Jews and Crusaders\" and calling for killing of American civilians. In addition to denouncing its content, many Islamic jurists stressed that bin Laden was not qualified to either issue a fatwa or declare a jihad.\nThe Amman Message was a statement, signed in 2005 in Jordan by nearly 200 prominent Islamic jurists, which served as a \"counter-fatwa\" against a widespread use of \"takfir\" (excommunication) by jihadist groups to justify jihad against rulers of Muslim-majority countries. The Amman Message recognized eight legitimate schools of Islamic law and prohibited declarations of apostasy against them. The statement also asserted that fatwas can be issued only by properly trained muftis, thereby seeking to delegitimize fatwas issued by militants who lack the requisite qualifications.\nErroneous and sometimes bizarre fatwas issued by unqualified or eccentric individuals in recent times have sometimes given rise to complaints about a \"chaos\" in the modern practice of \"ifta\".\nFatwas in the West.\nIn the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, a group of Middle Eastern Islamic scholars issued a fatwa permitting Muslims serving in the U.S. army to participate in military action against Muslim countries, in response to a query from a U.S. Army Muslim chaplain. This fatwa illustrated two increasingly widespread practices. First, it drew directly on the Quran and hadith without referencing the body of jurisprudence from any of the traditional schools of Islamic law. Secondly, questions from Western Muslims directed to muftis in Muslim-majority countries have become increasingly common, as about one-third of Muslims now live in Muslim-minority countries.\nInstitutions devoted specifically to issuing fatwas to Western Muslims have been established in the West, including the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA, founded in 1986) and the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR, founded in 1997). These organizations aim to provide fatwas that address the concerns of Muslim minorities, helping them to comply with sharia, while stressing compatibility of Islam with diverse modern contexts. The FCNA was founded with the goal of developing legal methodologies for adopting Islamic law to life in the West. The ECRF draws on all major schools of Sunni law as well as other traditional legal principles, such as concern for the public good, local custom, and the prevention of harm, to derive fatwas suitable for life in Europe. For example, a 2001 ECRF ruling allowed a woman who had converted to Islam to remain married without requiring her husband's conversion, based in part on the existence of European laws and customs under which women are guaranteed the freedom of religion. Rulings of this kind have been welcomed by some, but also criticized by others as being overly eclectic in legal methodology and having potential to negatively impact the interpretation of sharia in Muslim-majority countries.\nThe needs of Western Muslims have given rise to a new branch of Islamic jurisprudence which has been termed the jurisprudence of (Muslim) minorities (\"fiqh al-aqall\u012by\u0101t\"). The term is believed to have been coined in a 1994 fatwa by Taha Jabir Alalwani, then the chairman of FCNA, which encouraged Muslim citizens to participate in American politics. This branch of jurisprudence has since been developed primarily, but not exclusively for Muslim minorities in the West.\nRole of modern media.\nAdvances in communication technology and the rise of the internet have changed the reception and role of fatwas in modern society. In the pre-modern era, most fatwas issued in response to private queries were read only by the petitioner. Early in the 20th century, the reformist Islamic scholar Rashid Rida responded to thousands of queries from around the Muslim world on a variety of social and political topics in the regular \"fatwa\" section of his Cairo-based journal \"Al-Manar\". In the late 20th century, when the Grand Mufti of Egypt Sayyid Tantawy issued a fatwa allowing interest banking, the ruling was vigorously debated in the Egyptian press by both religious scholars and lay intellectuals.\nIn the internet age, a large number of websites has appeared offering fatwas to readers around the world. For example, IslamOnline publishes an archive of \"live fatwa\" sessions, whose number approached a thousand by 2007, along with biographies of the muftis. Together with satellite television programs, radio shows and fatwa hotlines offering call-in fatwas, these sites have contributed to the rise of new forms of contemporary \"ifta\". Unlike the concise or technical pre-modern fatwas, fatwas delivered through modern mass media often seek to be more expansive and accessible to the wide public.\nModern media have also facilitated cooperative forms to \"ifta\". Networks of muftis are commonly engaged by fatwa websites, so that queries are distributed among the muftis in the network, who still act as individual jurisconsults. In other cases, Islamic jurists of different nationalities, schools of law, and sometimes even denominations (Sunni and Shia), coordinate to issue a joint fatwa, which is expected to command greater authority with the public than individual fatwas. The collective fatwa (sometimes called \"ijtih\u0101d jam\u0101\u02bf\u012b\", \"collective legal interpretation\") is a new historical development, and it is found in such settings as boards of Islamic financial institutions and international fatwa councils.\nSocial role of fatwas.\nAs the role of fatwas on strictly legal issues has declined in modern times, there has been a relative increase in the proportion of fatwas dealing with rituals and further expansion in purely religious areas like Quranic exegesis, creed, and Sufism. Modern fatwas also deal with a wide variety of other topics, including insurance, sex-change operations, moon exploration, beer drinking, abortion in the case of fatal foetal abnormalities, or males and females sharing workplaces. Public \"fatwa wars\" have reflected political controversies in the Muslim world, from anti-colonial struggles to the Gulf War of the 1990s, when muftis in some countries issued fatwas supporting collaboration with the US-led coalition, while muftis from other countries endorsed the Iraqi call for jihad against the US and its collaborators. In the private sphere, some muftis have begun to resemble social workers, giving advice on various personal issues encountered in everyday life.\nThe social profile of the fatwa petitioner has also undergone considerable changes. Owing to the rise of universal education, those who solicit fatwas have become increasingly educated, which has transformed the traditional mufti\u2013mustafti relationship based on restricted literacy. The questioner is now also increasingly likely to be female, and in the modern world, Muslim women tend to address muftis directly rather than conveying their query through a male relative as in the past. Since women now represent a significant proportion of students studying Islamic law and qualifying as muftiyas, their prominence in its interpretation is likely to rise. A fatwa hotline in the United Arab Emirates provides access to either male or female muftis, allowing women to request fatwas from female Islamic legal scholars.\nThe vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims. However, there is little research available to indicate to what extent Muslims acknowledge the authority of various fatwas and heed their rulings in real life. Rather than reflecting the actual conduct or opinions of Muslims, these fatwas may instead represent a collection of opinions on what Muslims \"ought to think\"."}
{"id": "11260", "revid": "8019410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11260", "title": "Relax (song)", "text": "\"Relax\" is the debut single by English new wave band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, released in the United Kingdom by ZTT Records in 1983.\nThe hit version, produced by Trevor Horn and featuring the band along with other musicians, entered the UK Top 75 singles chart in November 1983 but did not crack the Top 40 until early January 1984. Three weeks later it reached number one, on the chart dated 28 January 1984, replacing Paul McCartney's \"Pipes of Peace\". One of the decade's most controversial and most commercially successful records, \"Relax\" eventually sold a reported two million copies in the UK alone, easily ranking among the ten biggest-selling singles in the UK. It remained in the UK Top 40 for 37 consecutive weeks, 35 of which overlapped with a radio airplay ban by the BBC (owing to lyrics perceived as overtly sexual).\nIn June 1984, bolstered by the instant massive success of the band's follow-up single \"Two Tribes\", the single re-entered the Top Ten for a further nine weeks, including two spent at no. 2 (behind \"Two Tribes\"). At that time, Frankie Goes to Hollywood were the only act apart from the Beatles and John Lennon to concurrently occupy the top two positions on the chart. Several 12-inch single versions (and the \"Frankie Say Relax\" T-shirt craze) further fed the \"Relax\" phenomenon. The single re-entered the UK Top 75 in February 1985 and, more successfully, in October 1993, when it spent three weeks in the Top Ten. \"Relax\" remains the UK's biggest-selling debut single of all time.\nIn the United States \"Relax\" was also comparatively slow in reaching its chart peak. Released in March 1984, albeit with a different mix and nearly a minute shorter in length, the single stalled at no. 67 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot 100 in May during a seven-week run, but it ranked number one for the year on the Los Angeles \"alternative rock\" station KROQ, as voted for by listeners. In January 1985 a release of \"Relax\" that was far more similar to the UK hit version entered the Hot 100 at no. 70, and in March it reached no. 10 during its 16-week run. In January 1989 the single was certified gold by the RIAA.\nIn February 1985 the record was awarded Best British Single of 1984 at the Brit Awards, and Frankie Goes to Hollywood won Best British Newcomer. A version of the song features on Frankie Goes to Hollywood's debut album \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\", released in October 1984.\nBackground and recording.\nSinger Holly Johnson said the lyrics came to him as he was walking down Princess Avenue in Liverpool: \"I mean they were just, you know, words that floated into my head one day when I was walking down Princess Avenue with no bus fare, trying to get to rehearsals \u2013 I mean there was no great sort of calculated, 'Oh I'll sing these words and this record'll be banned'.\"\nZTT Records signed Frankie Goes to Hollywood after producer-turned-ZTT cofounder Trevor Horn saw the band play on the television show \"The Tube\", on which the group played an early version of \"Relax\". Horn described the original version of \"Relax\" as \"more a jingle than a song\", but he preferred to work with songs that were not professionally finished because he could then \"fix them up\" in his own style. Once the band was signed, ZTT co-founder Paul Morley mapped out the marketing campaign fashioned as a \"strategic assault on pop\". Morley opted to tackle the biggest possible themes in the band's singles (\"sex, war, religion\"), of which \"Relax\" would be the first, and emphasized the shock impact of Frankie members Holly Johnson's and Paul Rutherford's open homosexuality in the packaging and music videos.\nHorn dominated the recording of \"Relax\" in his effort for perfectionism. Initial sessions were held at the Manor Studio. The band were overawed and intimidated by Horn's reputation, and thus were too nervous to make suggestions. Johnson said in his autobiography, \"Whatever he said we went along with\". When attempts to record with the full band proved unsatisfactory, Horn hired former Ian Dury backing band the Blockheads for the sessions, with Norman Watt-Roy providing the original bass line. Those sessions were later deemed to be not modern-sounding enough. Instead, Watt-Roy's playing was replaced by a sampled E note on a bass guitar, which was layered over a Linn 2 bass drum.\nHorn then constructed a more electronic-based version of the song with keyboards by session musician Andy Richards and with rhythm programming assistance from J. J. Jeczalik of Art of Noise. Horn developed this version of the recording in his west London studio while the band remained in their hometown of Liverpool. Horn had made three versions of \"Relax\" prior to Richards and guitarist Stephen Lipson joining his ZTT Production 'Theam' in late 1983. Horn left the studio late one night asking for Lipson to erase the multitrack (of version 3) due to lack of progress, but came back into the studio some time later to hear Richards playing a variety of modal chords based around the key of E minor with Lipson playing guitar along to the unerased multitrack.\nUltimately, vocalists Johnson and Rutherford were the only band members to perform on the record. The only contribution by the other members was a sample crafted from the sound of the rest of the band jumping into a swimming pool. Johnson later said that \"Trevor didn't like the band's standard of playing as he couldn't sync it to his machinery\". Horn later recalled of the song's intro, \"Hit singles are not just good songs. They need to be moments. Holly had been blowing his saxophone on the studio roof in Notting Hill at 2am, and a bunch of guys appeared on the street, calling up to him. He came down to do the vocal, and I suggested he play it at the start of Relax.\"\nIn a 2021 interview, Horn said that \"the band we signed weren't quite the band who had appeared on the original demo, though we didn't know that at the time\". The demo had featured Jed O'Toole, brother of bassist Mark O'Toole, on guitar, who subsequently left to pursue a 9-to-5 career. He was replaced by Brian Nash, who was a guitar novice at the time the single was recorded, though Horn acknowledged that he developed into a good guitarist by the time \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" was finished. Horn completed the recording having spent \u00a370,000 in studio time.\nRelease, controversy and ban by the BBC.\nMorley intentionally courted scandal with the promotion of \"Relax\". ZTT initiated the ad campaign for \"Relax\" with two quarter-page ads in the British music press. The first ad featured images of Rutherford in a sailor cap and a leather vest, and Johnson with a shaved head and rubber gloves. The images were accompanied by the phrase \"ALL THE NICE BOYS LOVE SEA MEN\", a pun on the music hall song \"Ship Ahoy! (All the Nice Girls Love a Sailor)\". It declared \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood are coming\u00a0... making Duran Duran lick the shit off their shoes\u00a0... Nineteen inches that must be taken always.\" The second ad promised \"theories of bliss, a history of Liverpool from 1963 to 1983, a guide to Amsterdam bars\".\nWhen the single was first released in November 1983, the initial progress of \"Relax\" on the UK Top 75 was sluggish. First charting at no. 67, it had progressed only to no. 35 by its seventh week on the chart, even having fallen back slightly during that time. But then on Thursday 5 January 1984, Frankie Goes to Hollywood were shown performing \"Relax\" on the BBC flagship television chart show, \"Top of the Pops\". The following week it soared to no. 6. On 11 January 1984, Radio 1 disc jockey Mike Read expressed on air his distaste for both the record's suggestive sleeve (designed by Anne Yvonne Gilbert) and its lyric, which centred on the oft-repeated \"Relax, don't do it/When you want to sock it to it/Relax, don't do it/ When you want to come.\" He announced his refusal to play the record, not knowing the BBC had just decided the song was not to be played on the BBC anyway. Holly Johnson admitted that while the label claimed the lyric was \"When you want to sock it to it\", he was actually singing \"When you want to suck it, chew it\".\nIn support of their disc jockey, BBC Radio banned the single from its shows a reported two days later (although certain prominent night-time BBC shows\u00a0\u2013 including those of Kid Jensen and John Peel\u00a0\u2013 continued to play the record, as they saw fit, during 1984). The now-banned \"Relax\" rose to no. 2 on the charts by 17 January, and hit the number-one spot on 24 January. By this time, the BBC Radio ban had extended to \"Top of the Pops\" as well, which simply displayed a still picture of the group during its climactic number one announcement, before airing a performance by a non-number one artist.\nThis went on for the five weeks that \"Relax\" was at number one. It then began a slow decline on the charts, falling back as far as no. 31 in May 1984 before returning to no. 2 in July whilst Frankie's follow-up single \"Two Tribes\" held the UK number-one spot. In the end, \"Relax\" remained in the Top 75 for 48 consecutive weeks and returned in February 1985 for four more, giving a total of 52.\nThe ban became an embarrassment for the BBC, especially given that UK commercial radio and television stations were still playing the song. Later in 1984 the ban was lifted and \"Relax\" featured on both the Christmas Day edition of \"Top of the Pops\" and Radio 1's rundown of the best-selling singles of the year.\nThroughout the \"Relax\" controversy, the band continued to publicly deny that the song's lyrics were sexual. Nevertheless, by late 1984, it was clear that the public were aware of the sexual nature of the lyrics, but the scandal had fuelled sales anyway. In 1985, with the release of the \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" album (which included \"Relax\"), the band dropped any public pretence about the lyrics: \nThe track was reissued in September 1993, the first of a string of Frankie Goes to Hollywood singles to be reissued that year. It debuted at a high no. 6 on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at no. 5 the following week. It spent seven weeks in the Top 75 this time, thus extending its combined total to 59, making it at the time the third longest runner of all time; it has since been surpassed by 44 other songs and sits in joint 47th place.\nCritical reception.\nAmerican magazine \"Cash Box\" said that the song is \"a very danceable cut\", in which \"heavy bass and bass drum provide the backdrop for Frankie's pleading lyric and Frank Sinatraesque soaring vocal.\" Alan Jones from \"Music Week\" gave the 1993 remix four out of five, writing, \"ZTT recently got its catalogue back from Island, and is about to embark on a high profile re-issue/remix campaign, of which this is the first fruit. \"Relax\" is updated by Ollie J in a stomping house mix, while Jam &amp; Spoon's pumped-up Hi-NRG version is hardcore tempo. With the original mixes added to the package, this is going to be big all over again. But will One FM play it?\" Richard Harris from \"NME\" commented, \"'Relax' sounds as divine as ever; a perfect soundtrack for pubescents to discover the delightful realities of having hormones.\"\nPersonnel.\nCredits sourced from \"Sound on Sound\"\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood\nOther musicians\nOriginal 1983\u20131984 mixes.\nAlthough the 7-inch version of the single remained unchanged throughout its initial release (a mix generally known as \"Relax (Move)\"), promotional 7-inch records featuring a substantially different mix of \"Relax\" (entitled either \"The Last Seven Inches\" or \"Warp Mix\" because it is a compilation of other versions) were the subject of a limited 1984 release.\nThree principal 12-inch remixes of \"Relax\" were eventually created by producer Trevor Horn:\nOne of the reasons we did all the remixes was that the initial 12-inch version of 'Relax' contained something called 'The Sex Mix', which was 16 minutes long and didn't even contain a song. It was really Holly Johnson just jamming, as well as a bunch of samples of the group jumping in the swimming pool and me sort of making disgusting noises by dropping stuff into buckets of water! We got so many complaints about it\u00a0\u2014 particularly from gay clubs, who found it offensive\u00a0\u2014 that we cut it in half and reduced it down to eight minutes, by taking out some of the slightly more offensive parts [this became \"Sex Mix (Edition 2)\"]. Then we got another load of complaints, because the single version wasn't on the 12-inch\u00a0\u2014 I didn't see the point in this at the time, but I was eventually put straight about it.\nHorn attested that visits to New York's Paradise Garage club led to the creation of the final \"Relax (New York Mix)\", which ultimately replaced the original \"Sex Mix\" releases:\nIt was only when I went to this club and heard the sort of things they were playing that I really understood about 12-inch remixes. Although I myself had already had a couple of big 12-inch hits, I'd never heard them being played on a big sound system, and so I then went back and mixed 'Relax' again and that was the version which sold a couple of million over here [in the UK].\nThe original 12-inch version of \"Relax\", labelled \"Sex Mix\", ran for over 16 minutes, and is broadly as described by Horn above. The subsequent \"Edition 2\" was an 8-minute-plus edit of the \"Sex Mix\", and can only be distinguished by having \"12ISZTAS1\" etched on the vinyl. The final 12-inch mix, containing no elements from the foregoing versions, was designated the \"New York Mix\", and ran for approximately 7:20. This was the most commonly available 12-inch version of \"Relax\" during its worldwide 1984 chart success.\nThe UK cassette single featured \"Greatest Bits\", a unique amalgam of excerpts from the \"Sex Mix\", \"New York Mix\", \"Move\" and an instrumental version of \"Move\".\nSince virtually all of the UK \"Relax\" 12-inch singles were labelled \"Sex Mix\", a method of differentiating between versions by reference to the record's matrix numbers necessarily became \"de rigueur\" for collectors of Frankie Goes to Hollywood releases (and ultimately collectors of ZTT records in general).\n\"Relax (Come Fighting)\" was the version of the song included on the \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" album. This is ostensibly a variant of the 7-inch single \"Move\" mix, but is different from that version. For example, the 7\" mix fades in on a foghorn type sound while the album mix fades in on sustained synth chords. Also, the backing vocals of the 7\" mix are panned to the left, whereas they are mixed in the centre on the album version. Additionally, the 7\" mix features a prominent reverberated kick drum sound during the introduction that also appears in other parts of the song, which is completely absent from the album mix. The album mix also has a certain post-production sheen (greater stereo separation of parts, more strategic uses of reverb, etc.) that is absent from the original 1983 7-inch single mix. The \"Classic 1993 Version\" is a version of the original 7\" mix that uses \"Bonus, Again\" as the instrumental track, although modification with elements from \"Come Fighting\" thrown in (e.g. both the intro and outro come directly from it) and much of it made to sound more clear.\nThe original airing of Relax on \"The Tube\", before the band were signed to ZTT, featured another verse that was edited from all the released versions, \"In heaven everything is fine, you've got yours and I've got mine\", referencing the Peter Ivers song \"In Heaven\" from the David Lynch film \"Eraserhead\".\nAccording to a fan enquiry by a member of the Alternate forum (a forum dedicated to ZTT) to Holly Johnson over accusation that \"Edition 2\" was created by a DJ, \"Edition 2\" was edited by Trevor Horn at the Sarm East studio with J. J. Jeczalik engineering and Johnson watching.\nB-sides.\nThe 7-inch featured \"One September Monday\", an interview between ZTT's Paul Morley, Holly Johnson and Paul Rutherford. During the interview, Holly revealed that the group's name derived from a page of the \"New Yorker\" magazine, headlined \"Frankie Goes Hollywood\" and featuring Frank Sinatra \"getting mobbed by teenyboppers\".\nOn all of the original 12-inch releases, the B-side featured a cover of \"Ferry 'Cross the Mersey\", followed by a brief dialogue involving Rutherford attempting to sign on, and an a cappella version of the title track's chorus, segueing into an instrumental version of \"Relax\", known as \"Bonus, Again\" (which resembles \"Come Fighting\" more than the 7\" mix).\nThe UK cassette single included \"Ferry 'Cross the Mersey\" and interview sections not included on \"One September Monday\".\nVideos.\nThe first official music video for \"Relax\", directed by Bernard Rose and set in an S&amp;M themed gay nightclub at Wilton's music hall in London it featuring the bandmembers accosted by buff leathermen, a glamorous drag queen, and an obese admirer dressed up as a Roman emperor, played by actor John Dair, was allegedly banned by MTV and the BBC, prompting the recording of a second video, directed by Godley and Creme in early 1984, featuring the group performing with the help of laser beams. However, after the second video was made the song was banned completely by the BBC, meaning that neither video was ever broadcast on any BBC music programmes.\nA live performance video of the song was directed by David Mallet, making the rounds at MTV. The live version was released as the B-side of the US 12\" version of \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\", titled \"Relax (International)\".\nAnother MTV video of the studio version includes footage from the Brian De Palma film \"Body Double\". \"Body Double\", a popular 1984 erotic thriller film, contains a film within a film sequence in which Frankie Goes to Hollywood performs \"Relax\" on the set of a porn film.\n\"Zoolander\" versions.\n\"Relax\" is a major plot point in the film \"Zoolander\" (2001), where the titular character is conditioned to assassinate a target when he hears the song. Limp Bizkit also recorded their own version for the film, though Powerman 5000's cover was used instead, in both the film and on the soundtrack. \"Relax\" was also used for the trailer of \"Zoolander 2\" (2016).\nRe-issues.\nThe title track has periodically been reissued as a single in a number of remix forms."}
{"id": "11261", "revid": "46170964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11261", "title": "Two Tribes", "text": "\"Two Tribes\" is an anti-war song by British band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, released in the UK by ZTT Records on 4 June 1984. The song was later included on the album \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\". Presenting a nihilistic, gleeful lyric expressing enthusiasm for nuclear war, it juxtaposes a relentless pounding bass line and guitar riff inspired by American funk and R&amp;B pop with influences of Russian classical music, in an opulent arrangement produced by Trevor Horn.\nThe single was a phenomenal success in the UK, helped by a wide range of remixes and supported by an advertising campaign depicting the band as members of the Red Army. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number one on 10 June 1984, where it stayed for nine consecutive weeks, during which time the group's previous single \"Relax\" climbed back up the charts to number two. It was the longest-running number-one single in the UK of the 1980s. It has sold 1.58 million copies in the UK as of November 2012, being in the Top 30 best-selling singles in the UK as of 2022.\nSongwriters Johnson, Gill and O'Toole received the 1984 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. In 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation's 14th-favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.\nMusic.\nA version of \"Two Tribes\" was originally recorded for a BBC John Peel session in October 1982. The session version makes clear that the basic structure of the song, including its signature bass-line, percussion arrangement and idiosyncratic introductory and middle eight sections, were already intact prior to any involvement from ZTT or eventual producer Trevor Horn.\nJohnson also noted: \"There's two elements in the music \u2013 an American funk line and a Russian line. It's the most obvious demonstration of two tribes that we have today.\" To accentuate the musical tension, Horn arranged the 'Russian' segments as a dramatic string arrangement. The driving funk/rock rhythm section was played on synthesisers.\nTitle and lyrics.\nThe single was released at a time when the Cold War had intensified and fears about global nuclear warfare were at a peak. Although Johnson would attest in a 1984 radio interview that the \"two tribes\" of the song potentially represented any pair of warring adversaries (giving the examples of \"cowboys and Indians or Captain Kirk and Klingons\"), the line \"On the air America/I modelled shirts by Van Heusen\" is a clear reference to then US President Ronald Reagan. Reagan had advertised for Phillips Van Heusen in 1953 (briefly reviving the association in the early 1980s). The title of his first film had been \"Love Is on the Air\".\nThe lyric \"working for the black gas\" is, according to Johnson, \"About oil surpassing gold. How you might as well be paid in petrol.\" And the line \"Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new gods?\" was inspired by the 1959 British film \"Cover Girl Killer\". Johnson explained, \"The TV was on in the background while I was doing me ironing and suddenly this character came out with that statement.\" (The actual dialogue, which occurs at about 48 minutes 24 seconds into the film, is \"Surely sex and horror are the new gods in this polluted world of so-called entertainment?\")\nThe track featured snippets of narration from actor Patrick Allen, recreating his narration from the British \"Protect and Survive\" public information films about how to survive a nuclear war. (The original \"Protect and Survive\" soundtracks were sampled for the 7-inch mixes.)\nThe 12-inch A- and B-sides featured voice parts by British actor Chris Barrie imitating Ronald Reagan. Barrie also voiced the Reagan puppet on \"Spitting Image\". Barrie's parts as 'Reagan' included praise for the band, as well as parts of Adolf Hitler's speech to a court after the Beer Hall Putsch: \"You may pronounce us guilty a thousand times over, but the Goddess of the Eternal Court of History will smile and tear to tatters the brief of the State Prosecutor and the sentence of this court, for She acquits us.\" Barrie also voiced the last sentence of \"History Will Absolve Me\" (Spanish: \"La historia me absolver\u00e1\") which is the concluding sentence and subsequent title of a four-hour speech made by Fidel Castro on 16 October 1953. Castro made the speech in his own defense in court against the charges brought against him after leading an attack on the Moncada Barracks on 26 July 1953. Barrie would return for the band's next single, \"The Power of Love\", imitating Mike Read in a parody of the DJ's ban on their previous single, \"Relax\".\nThe song's title derives from the line \"two mighty warrior tribes went to war\" from the film \"Mad Max 2\" (the line is also spoken by Holly Johnson at the beginning of the session version).\nCritical reception.\nAmerican magazine \"Cash Box\" called it \"a more scintillating anti-war track than [\"The War Song\"]\", saying it is \"both an effective dance cut and a piece of modern art.\" Richard Harris from \"NME\" wrote, Two Tribes' is a fine example of why over-production is a musical virtue, not least when it ceases to be a pop song and tries to disco-ise Tchaikovsky.\"\nPromotion.\nZTT aggressively marketed the single in terms of its topical political angle, promoting it with images of the group wearing American military garb in combat, as well as Soviet-style army uniforms set against an American urban backdrop.\nThe original cover art featured a Soviet mural of Vladimir Lenin in St Petersburg, and images of Reagan and then-UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The sleeve notes, attributed to ZTT's Paul Morley, dispassionately reported details of the relative nuclear arsenals of each superpower.\nPersonnel.\nCredits sourced from \"Sound on Sound\".\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood\nOther musicians\nOriginal 1984 mixes.\nThe song appeared in the form of six mixes, including \"Annihilation\", \"Carnage\", \"Hibakusha\", \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"We Don't Want to Die\" and \"For the Victims of Ravishment\".\nThe first 12-inch mix (\"Annihilation\") started with an air-raid siren, and included advice from Allen about how to tag and dispose of family members should they die in the fallout shelter (taken from the public information film \"Casualties\"). This version appeared on CD editions of the album. \"Annihilation\" was the basis for the \"Hibakusha\" mix, which was originally released in a limited edition, Japanese-only version of the 1985 album \"Bang!\". Hibakusha is the Japanese word for survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\"For the Victims of Ravishment\" appeared on the LP and cassette editions of the album \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\". It is the shortest version, at 3:27 minutes. This mix derived from the \"Carnage\" mix, which prominently featured strings as well as vocal samples from Allen and the group's B-side interview.\nSince 1984, \"Two Tribes\" has been re-issued several times, generally involving third-party remixes bearing little relation to the original releases in terms of either structure or character.\nB-sides.\nThe 7-inch featured \"One February Friday\", an interview between Morley and the group's three musicians, Mark O'Toole, Brian Nash and Peter Gill, over an otherwise untitled instrumental track. A similar track had been included on the B-side of \"Relax\", with the title \"One September Monday\".\nThe principal B-side to the original 12-inch single was a cover version of \"War\", which became the subject of an extended remix (subtitled \"Hidden\") on the single's third UK 12-inch release, where it was promoted as a double A-side with \"Carnage\".\nThe UK cassette single featured a cut-together combination of \"Surrender\", \"Carnage\" and \"Annihilation\", plus Reagan snippets and interview sections not included on any other release.\nVideos.\nThe Godley &amp; Creme-directed video depicted a wrestling match between then-US President Ronald Reagan and Konstantin Chernenko, then Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in front of group members and an assembly of representatives from the world's nations. The match eventually degenerates into global destruction. Certain violent moments (\"Reagan\" is seen, for example, biting \"Chernenko's\" ear) were edited from the version shown on MTV.\nA longer version of the video (based on the \"Hibakusha\" mix) included an introductory, heavily edited monologue by Richard Nixon taken from an ad from his 1960 US Presidential campaign (\"No\u00a0... firm diplomacy\u00a0... No\u00a0... peace for America and the world\"), plus similar contributions from other world leaders, including Lord Beaverbrook, Yasser Arafat and John F. Kennedy. The complete soundtrack to the extended video was eventually released as \"Two Tribes (Video Destructo)\" on the German version of the \"Twelve Inches\" compilation. A third version of the video, included on the band's \"From An Wasteland to an Artificial Paradise\" VHS, retains the introduction, but omits most of the inserted clips in the main wrestling sequence.\nTrack listing.\nAll discographical information pertains to the original UK single release only.\n7\": ZTT / ZTAS 3 United Kingdom:\nThe A-side mix is commonly referred as \"Cowboys and Indians\" to avoid confusion with other mixes, as ZTT commonly gives the sides on singles separate names.

The lyrics of the song were inspired by the poem \"Kubla Khan\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\nIn March 1985, the album track was abridged and remixed for release as the group's fourth UK single.\nWhile criticised at the time of release and afterward for being a song that glorifies debauchery, the lyrics (and video), just as Coleridge's poem, were about the \"dangers\" of mindless indulgence. This song, along with \"Relax\", made Frankie Goes to Hollywood even more controversial than they already were.\n\"Billboard\" compared it to \"Relax\", saying that \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" had \"less hook, less controversy, more drama.\"\nOriginal 1985 single.\nDespite the group's record label (ZTT) pre-emptively promoting the single as \"their fourth number one\", an achievement that would have set a new UK record for consecutive number one singles by a debuting artist, \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, being kept off the top spot by the Phil Collins/Philip Bailey duet \"Easy Lover\". The single spent a total of eleven weeks on the UK chart.\nIt was the first release by the group not to reach number one and, despite representing a creditable success in its own right, it symbolically confirmed the end of the chart invincibility that the group had enjoyed during 1984. Frankie Goes to Hollywood would not release another record for seventeen months, and they would fail to emulate their past chart success upon their return.\nThe spoken-word introductions to both 12-inch mixes are adapted from Walter Kaufmann's 1967 translation of Friedrich Nietzsche's \"The Birth of Tragedy\". The recitation on the first 12-inch/cassette single (\"Real Altered\") is by Gary Taylor, whilst that on the second 12-inch (\"Fruitness\") is by actor Geoffrey Palmer. It is unknown whether Palmer's concluding \"Welcome to the Pleasured\"r\"ome\" was a genuine mistake or a deliberately scripted one.\nThis is the only single from the group that was not released on a CD single at that time. \"Relax\", \"Two Tribes\", \"The Power of Love\" and \"Rage Hard+\" all saw a CD-maxi release in Germany at the end of the '80s. \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" was not given such a release. However, the 7-inch vinyl single was released in two different mixes, and it was purely random as to which one you ended up with, as both mixes were in identical sleeve designs and carried the same catalogue number. Not only that, but the subtitle used to identify different mixes was identical on both record labels, with only the matrix number on the run out groove giving the game away. The first 7-inch (matrix 7 A 1 U) carried the normal 7-inch single mix, which was guitar driven. However, the \"secret\" alternative mix (matrix 7 A 7 U or 7 A 8 U) was quite different, and featured on the apple-shaped picture disc. The subtitle for that disc was 'alternative reel' but on the 7-inch single the subtitle remained unchanged as 'altered real'.\nB-sides.\nAll releases featured an edited version of \"Get It On\", originally recorded for a BBC Radio 1 session in 1983 (a full-length version was included on the cassette release), plus a faded or full length version of \"Happy Hi!\", a non-album track.\nBoth \"Relax (International)\" and \"Born to Run\" are live recordings (with some minor overdubs), based on an actual live appearance on \"The Tube's\" \"Europe A-Go-Go\" in Newcastle during early January 1985.\nMusic video.\nThe music video for \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" was directed by Bernard Rose. It features the group stealing a car whilst Holly is flying in a helicopter chasing them, going to a carnival and encountering all manner of deceptively \"pleasureable\" activities. The audio soundtrack of the video was included as part of the cassette single.\nThree edits were made, the regular 4:55 version with the regular 7-inch mix, a 5:45 version matching what was included on the cassette single and a 7:52 version with a longer, different intro.\nPromotional releases.\nIn 1984, a few months prior to the album's release, an early instrumental version of the album track was issued as a promotional 12-inch single, entitled \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Pleasure Fix)\", along with a similar early instrumental of \"The Only Star in Heaven\" (subtitled \"Star Fix\"). These tracks were subsequently given wider release as part of the B-side to the second 12-inch of \"The Power of Love\" single.\n\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" was also used on several promotional records in the USA during 1985, featuring the following tracks in various combinations:\nTrack listings.\n7-inch: ZTT / ZTAS 7 (UK)\n7-inch: ZTT / ZTAS 7 (UK)\n7-inch: ZTT / PZTAS 7 (UK)\n7-inch: Island / 7-99653 (US)\n7-inch: Island / 107 199 EP (Germany)\n12-inch: ZTT / 12 ZTAS 7 (UK)\n12-inch: ZTT / 12 XZTAS 7 (UK)\n12-inch: Island / 0-96889 (US)\nCassette: ZTT / CTIS 107 (UK)\nReissues.\nThe track has periodically been reissued as a single, including during 1993 and 2000. Although these releases have some admirers, and have usefully made available various original mixes on CD for the first time, the accompanying A-side remixes by contemporary DJs have tended on the whole to bear little or no comparison to the spirit of the originals.\nReissues in the group's name have also tended to shun any overt reference to the identity of the original artists, and the reissue artwork has notably featured no images of the group. It has been suggested that this situation may relate to Johnson's successful but acrimonious court case against ZTT in 1989, which freed him (and effectively the other group members) from their contract with the label.\nOther versions.\nThe instrumental \"Into Battle Mix\" appears on the soundtrack to the film \"Toys\", specifically utilised whenever the Tommy Tanks appeared."}

It was released on 25 August 1986 as the first single from their second album \"Liverpool\". The song reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in Germany and it was also a massive success in other countries.\nBackground.\nHaving topped the charts around the world with \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" and its accompanying singles, Frankie Goes to Hollywood took off to Amsterdam to record the follow-up album, \"Liverpool\". Taking on a rockier edge, \"Rage Hard\" was the first single culled from the album.\nIn a 1986 interview, singer Holly Johnson was asked about the meaning of the song explaining, \"Have you read the poem 'Do Not Go Gently Into That Good Night' by Dylan Thomas? It was kind of inspired by that. It's an incantation against death and lethargy, and it's supposed to encourage lots of creative idealism in the listener.\" \nNot only was it the first Frankie single to be featured on CD single, it was also the first single to not feature a cassette release\u2014new rules limited the number of items that could count towards the official charts, following the earlier ZTT excesses. \"Rage Hard\" eventually hit number 4 in the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in Germany for two weeks, #5 in Switzerland, #7 in the Netherlands, #12 in Austria, #19 in Sweden and #32 in France.\nCritical reception.\nIn a contemporary review, \"Billboard\" praised the band's performance calling \"the matured Frankie socks out weight art-rock best suited to AOR/ alternative radio.\" Ro Newton of \"Smash Hits\" compared the single unfavorably with their previous releases as, \"watered-down and without the guts. The over all effect is a bit limp and very disappointing.\"\nB-sides.\nThe original B-side is an odd composition entitled \"(Don't Lose What's Left) Of Your Little Mind\". It was released in two versions\u2014a 4-minute mix and a 6-minute mix\u2014and featured Holly Johnson and Brian Nash imitating Count von Count (\"Ha ha ha/I am the Count\") from the children's TV show \"Sesame Street\". This was complemented by sampled burps and belches over a backing track.\nFor the 12\" single to \"Rage Hard\" were covers of David Bowie's \"Suffragette City\", stylized as \"SuffRAGEtte City\" to fit in with the \"Rage Hard\" promotion and the second cover song was the Doors' \"Roadhouse Blues.\" A shorter version features on the CD single.\nTrack listing.\nAll discographical information pertains to UK releases only.\n7\": ZTT / ZTAS 22 United Kingdom.\n\"rage rage\"\n12\": ZTT / 12 ZTAS 22 United Kingdom.\n\"Slam Bam\"\nCD: ZTT / CD ZCID 22 United Kingdom.\nTracks 1 and 3.1 were re-released on the \"Sexmix\" compilation in 2012.\n1993 version.\nA version of the song appeared as a B-side of \"The Power of Love\" reissue (FGTH 3), entitled the \"original DJ mix\".

{"id": "11267", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11267", "title": "Liverpool (album)", "text": "Liverpool is the second and final studio album by British band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, released in October 1986. Produced by Stephen Lipson and mixed by Trevor Horn, the album showcases a heavy rock sound in contrast to the synth dance tone found in its predecessor, \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\". The recording sessions would be marred by the radical change in musical direction creating tension within the band.\nThe album received mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial disappointment compared to its predecessor, but it charted at number 5 in the United Kingdom and was a modest success in other countries. It would be supported by the lead single \u201cRage Hard\u201d, a UK number 5 and number 1 in Germany. \"Liverpool\" would be the band's final album as lead singer Holly Johnson would leave the band followed by a flurry of lawsuits from ZTT.\nRecording.\nJohnson was distant from the band during the sessions and was unhappy about the album's focus on rock over dance. Jill Sinclair, Horn's wife and one of the ZTT founders, later alleged that Johnson had been uncooperative and absent for most of the sessions. According to Nash, Johnson was preoccupied with the serious illness of Wolfgang Kuhle, then Johnson's boyfriend, but he did not tell the band. Johnson's distancing and disinterest came to the point that the band members concluded he was \"finished and were in the market for a new singer\". They invited Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon but he declined, Pete Wylie was also approached, but Johnson eventually remained with the band and completed \"Liverpool\". The session studio recordings were made in Ibiza, Holland and London.\nProduction.\nThe album's production was handled by Trevor Horn's engineer Stephen Lipson, who urged the band to play their own instruments on this album (Horn having replaced many of the band's performances and arrangements with his session musicians or his own performances on \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\"). According to Nash, the band was given contradicting information, with Horn considered as a producer or executive producer. In the end Horn took over mixing it on which \"spent a whopping \u00a3500,000 (making \u00a3840,000 in all) tidying it up\". The band was so much in debt that they had to sell at least a million copies to start earning \"a penny\".\nMusic.\n\"Liverpool\" features a heavier rock sound than its predecessor. Frankie Goes to Hollywood have not released any more studio albums since \"Liverpool\". The cover photo was different depending on what format was purchased (LP, cassette, or compact disc).\nRelease.\nThe album was a commercial disappointment compared to the band's previous effort, though it charted generally high at No. 5 in the United Kingdom and Germany, No. 7 on the Austrian and Swiss music charts and No. 8 in Norway. It produced the top 5 single \"Rage Hard\" (No. 1 in Germany), top 20 single \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" and top 30 single \"Watching the Wildlife\". By March 1988, the album had sold around 800,000 copies. On 20 June 2011 was released a 2xCD reissue including session recordings, mixes and covers of David Bowie, the Doors and Rolling Stones.\nCritical reception.\nIn the 80s and 90s the album received poor critical reception. \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" wrote: \"Like most of the era's one-hit wonders, the group did make a second album, though God only knows why anyone would want to hear it.\"\nAlex S. Garcia writing 2.5/5 review for AllMusic considered that \"on many accounts, \"Liverpool\" can be considered as an improvement over its predecessor\", that being shorter duration and almost the same quality of all songs, and \"the production is impeccable ... worth a listen if you like the band or have an interest for 80s music\u2014of which this is not such a bad sample\".\nPaul Lester in BBC review of 2011 reissue noted how \"many of the [original] tracks are straight hard rock/metal, with the lavish sonics and orchestral pomp typical of the ZTT label dropped on top\", and that the reissue is \"a superb repackage of what remains one of the great anticlimaxes in pop\". Lester compared the original album to the similar \"climb-down\" records ABC's \"Beauty Stab\" (1983) and Simple Minds' \"Sparkle in the Rain\" (1984), \"those other early-80s albums where the bands in question retreated from studio opulence towards a more 'authentic' approach that proved they could reproduce the music live; that they were Proper Rock Bands.\"\nSteve Howe, who played on the album, said in a 2023 interview, \"I just was hoping so much that \"Liverpool\" [...] would [...] make a meaningful dent in the [...] success of the band because it was just great.\"\nPersonnel.\nAdditional personnel"}

{"id": "11273", "revid": "41735740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11273", "title": "Faroese language", "text": "Faroese ( ; ) is a North Germanic language spoken as a first language by about 69,000 Faroe Islanders, of whom 21,000 reside mainly in Denmark and elsewhere.\nIt is one of five languages descended from Old West Norse spoken in the Middle Ages; the others include Norwegian, Icelandic, and the extinct Norn and Greenlandic Norse. Faroese and Icelandic, its closest extant relative, are not easily mutually intelligible in speech, but the written languages resemble each other quite closely, largely owing to Faroese's etymological orthography.\nHistory.\nAround 900 AD, the language spoken in the Faroes was Old Norse, which Norse settlers had brought with them during the time of the settlement of Faroe Islands () that began in 825. However, many of the settlers were not from Scandinavia, but descendants of Norse settlers in the Irish Sea region. In addition, women from Norse Ireland, Orkney, or Shetland often married native Scandinavian men before settling in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. As a result, the Irish language has had some influence on both Faroese and Icelandic.\nThere is speculation about Irish language place names in the Faroes: for example, the names of Mykines, St\u00f3ra D\u00edmun, L\u00edtla D\u00edmun and Argir have been hypothesized to contain Celtic roots. Other examples of early-introduced words of Celtic origin are: / (buttermilk), cf. Middle Irish ; (tail-piece of an animal), cf. Middle Irish ; (head, headhair), cf. Middle Irish ; (hand, paw), cf. Middle Irish ; (bull), cf. Middle Irish ; and (pasture in the outfield), cf. Middle Irish .\nBetween the 9th and the 15th centuries, a distinct Faroese language evolved, although it was probably still mutually intelligible with Old West Norse, and remained similar to the Norn language of Orkney and Shetland during Norn's earlier phase.\nFaroese ceased to be a written language after the Danish\u2013Norwegian Reformation of the early 16th century, with Danish replacing Faroese as the language of administration and education. The islanders continued to use the language in ballads, folktales, and everyday life. This maintained a rich spoken tradition, but for 300 years the language was not used in written form.\nIn 1823, the Danish Bible Society published a diglot of the Gospel of Matthew, with Faroese on the left and Danish on the right.\nVenceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb and the Icelandic grammarian and politician J\u00f3n Sigur\u00f0sson published a written standard for Modern Faroese in 1854, which still exists. They set a standard for the orthography of the language, based on its Old Norse roots and similar to that of Icelandic. The main purpose of this was for the spelling to represent the diverse dialects of Faroese in equal measure. Additionally, it had the advantages of being etymologically clear and keeping the kinship with the Icelandic written language. The actual pronunciation, however, often differs considerably from the written rendering. The letter \"\u00f0\", for example, has no specific phoneme attached to it.\nJakob Jakobsen devised a rival system of orthography, based on his wish for a phonetic spelling, but this system was never taken up by the speakers.\nIn 1908, Scripture Gift Mission published the Gospel of John in Faroese.\nIn 1937, Faroese replaced Danish as the official school language, in 1938, as the church language, and in 1948, as the national language by the Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands. The first complete translation of the Bible was completed in 1948.\nUp until the 1980s public radio broadcasts were primarily conducted in Norwegian and Danish. This helps to explain why older generations can speak Norwegian in addition to Danish and Faroese. Faroese broadcasts quickly replaced earlier programs and now all radio content is transmitted in the language, alongside all local newspapers. Today, Danish is considered a foreign language, although around 5% of residents on the Faroes learn it as a first language. Both Danish and English are obligatory at the primary and secondary school levels, with fluency in English becoming increasingly valued particularly among the younger generations. Films and television are frequently shown in English with Danish subtitles.\nIn 2017, the tourist board Visit Faroe Islands launched a website entitled Faroe Islands Translate. Text can be entered in thirteen languages, including English, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Instead of an instant machine translation being given, the text goes to a volunteer who will provide a live video translation, or else a recorded one later. The aim of this project was to get Faroese featured on Google Translate.\nOld Faroese.\nOld Faroese (, ca. mid-14th to mid-16th centuries) is a form of Old Norse spoken in medieval times in the Faroe Islands. The most crucial aspects of the development of Faroese are diphthongisation and palatalisation.\nThere is not enough data available to establish an accurate chronology of Faroese, but a rough one may be developed through comparison to the chronologies of Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian. In the 12th/13th centuries, \"\u00e1\" and \"\u01eb\u0301\" merged as ; later on at the beginning of the 14th century, delabialization took place: \"y\", \"\u00f8y\", \"au\" &gt; ; \"\u00ed\" and \"\u00fd\" merged in addition to \"i\" and \"y\", but in the case of \"\u00ed\" and \"\u00fd\", it appears that labialisation took place instead as is documented by later development to . Further, the language underwent a palatalisation of \"k\", \"g\" and \"sk\" before Old Norse \"e\", \"i\", \"y\", \"\u00f8\", \"au\" &gt; &gt; &gt; . Before the palatalisation \"\u00e9\" and \"\u01fd\" merged as and approximately in the same period epenthetic \"u\" is inserted into word-final and clusters.\nA massive quantity shift also operated in Middle Faroese. In the case of \"skerping\", it took place after delabialization but before loss of post-vocalic \"\u00f0\" and \"g\" . The shift of \"hv\" to , the deletion of in (remaining) word-initial \u2013sonorant clusters (\"hr\", \"hl\", \"hn\" &gt; \"r\", \"l\", \"n\"), and the dissolution of \"\u00fe\" (\"\u00fe\" &gt; \"t\"; \"\u00fe\" &gt; \"h\" in demonstrative pronouns and adverbs) appeared before the end of the 13th century. Another undated change is the merger of \"\u01eb\", \"\u00f8\" and \"\u01ff\" into ; pre-nasal \"\u01eb\", \"\u01eb\u0301\" &gt; \"o\", \"\u00f3\". \"enk\", \"eng\" probably became , in the 14th century; the development of \"a\" to before \"ng\", \"nk\" appeared after the palatalisation of \"k\", \"g\", and \"sk\" had been completed, such a change is quite a recent development, as well as change \"Cve\" &gt; \"Cv\u00f8\".\nDialects.\nFaroese is a highly variable language with many dialects actively used across the islands\u2019 approximately 120 communities. While the dialect of T\u00f3rshavn is the most prominent due to the city's outstanding size, there is no official spoken standard variety, and little evidence that the T\u00f3rshavn dialect has developed prestige status. Faroese speech communities are tightly knit and the use of dialectal speech is widely encouraged.\nThe study of Faroese dialectology began hundreds of years ago, with the scholar Lucas Debes noting a north\u2013south distinction as early as 1673. In the 18th century linguist Jens Christian Svabo made further distinctions, such as identifying the T\u00f3rshavn dialect, though his categorization lacked thorough justification. In 1891 Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb would write a more definitive study of the language's variation, noting distinguishing characteristics of the north\u2013south divide such as the northern aspiration of unvoiced plosives after long vowels and the pronunciation of as in most of the north compared to in the south.\nThe most recent and detailed classification by Hjalmar P. Petersen divides the language into four major varieties including North-Western Faroese, Central Faroese, Northern Faroese, and Southern Faroese. Additional sub-dialects of particular islands and villages have also been identified. Most of the analysis by Petersen and earlier authors is based on phonological evidence.\nThe southern variety of Faroese is very distinct, possibly due to geographic distance exacerbated by the lack of underwater tunnels which have connected most other islands north of Sandur. The dialect of these islands is characterized by a unique form of certain personal pronouns, alongside phonological features such as the intervocalic voicing of non-geminate stops. The fortis consonants , , and are aspirated following long vowels.\nThe central dialect area centered around Su\u00f0urstreymoy features a merging of and in unstressed ending syllables. The fortis consonants are neither aspirated nor weakened. The island of N\u00f3lsoy is a notable transitional area due to its unique realization of long as and short as compared to the and found in T\u00f3rshavn and elsewhere.\nThe northern dialect is characterized by weakened fortis consonants and a monophthongal pronunciation of in ending syllables, i.e., . The realization of as dominates in this region, although small parts of the central and northwestern regions use this pronunciation as well.\nThe northwestern dialect features aspirated fortis consonants after long vowels. The and vowels remain unmerged in unstressed ending syllables. Long is pronounced and short is pronounced .\nAlphabet.\nThe Faroese alphabet consists of 29 letters derived from the Latin script:\nPhonology.\nAs with most other Germanic languages, Faroese has a large number of vowels, with 26 in total. Vowel distribution is similar to other North Germanic languages in that short vowels appear in closed syllables (those ending in consonant clusters or long consonants) and long vowels appearing in open syllables.\nFaroese shares with Icelandic and Danish the feature of maintaining a contrast between stops based exclusively on aspiration, not voicing. Geminated stops may be pre-aspirated in intervocalic and word-final position. Intervocalically the aspirated consonants become pre-aspirated unless followed by a closed vowel. In clusters, the preaspiration merges with a preceding nasal or apical approximant, rendering them voiceless.\nThere are several phonological processes involved in Faroese, including:\nGrammar.\nFaroese grammar is related and very similar to that of modern Icelandic and Old Norse. Faroese is an inflected language with three grammatical genders and four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive."}

The Standard Model presently recognizes seventeen distinct particles\u2014twelve fermions and five bosons. As a consequence of flavor and color combinations and antimatter, the fermions and bosons are known to have 48 and 13 variations, respectively. Among the 61 elementary particles embraced by the Standard Model number: electrons and other leptons, quarks, and the fundamental bosons. Subatomic particles such as protons or neutrons, which contain two or more elementary particles, are known as composite particles.\nOrdinary matter is composed of atoms, themselves once thought to be indivisible elementary particles. The name \"atom\" comes from the Ancient Greek word \"\u1f04\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2\" (atomos) which means \"indivisible\" or \"uncuttable\". Despite the theories about atoms that had existed for thousands of years, the factual existence of atoms remained controversial until 1905. In that year, Albert Einstein published his paper on Brownian motion, putting to rest theories that had regarded molecules as mathematical illusions. Einstein subsequently identified matter as ultimately composed of various concentrations of energy.\nSubatomic constituents of the atom were first identified toward the end of the 19th century, beginning with the electron, followed by the proton in 1919, the photon in the 1920s, and the neutron in 1932. By that time, the advent of quantum mechanics had radically altered the definition of a \"particle\" by putting forward an understanding in which they carried out a simultaneous existence as matter waves.\nMany theoretical elaborations upon, and beyond, the Standard Model have been made since its codification in the 1970s. These include notions of supersymmetry, which double the number of elementary particles by hypothesizing that each known particle associates with a \"shadow\" partner far more massive. However, like an additional elementary boson mediating gravitation, such superpartners remain undiscovered as of 2013.\nOverview.\nAll elementary particles are either bosons or fermions. These classes are distinguished by their quantum statistics: fermions obey Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics and bosons obey Bose\u2013Einstein statistics. Their spin is differentiated via the spin\u2013statistics theorem: it is half-integer for fermions, and integer for bosons.\nIn the Standard Model, elementary particles are represented for predictive utility as point particles. Though extremely successful, the Standard Model is limited by its omission of gravitation and has some parameters arbitrarily added but unexplained.\nCosmic abundance of elementary particles.\nAccording to the current models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the primordial composition of visible matter of the universe should be about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium-4 (in mass). Neutrons are made up of one up and two down quarks, while protons are made of two up and one down quark. Since the other common elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass contribution to the observable universe's total mass. Therefore, one can conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, which, like all baryons, in turn consist of up quarks and down quarks.\nSome estimates imply that there are roughly baryons (almost entirely protons and neutrons) in the observable universe.\nThe number of protons in the observable universe is called the Eddington number.\nIn terms of number of particles, some estimates imply that nearly all the matter, excluding dark matter, occurs in neutrinos, which constitute the majority of the roughly elementary particles of matter that exist in the visible universe. Other estimates imply that roughly elementary particles exist in the visible universe (not including dark matter), mostly photons and other massless force carriers.\nStandard Model.\nThe Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary fermions, plus their corresponding antiparticles, as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the Higgs boson, which was reported on July 4, 2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ATLAS and CMS). The Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, however, since it is not known if it is compatible with Einstein's general relativity. There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model, such as the graviton, the particle that would carry the gravitational force, and sparticles, supersymmetric partners of the ordinary particles.\nFundamental fermions.\nThe 12\u00a0fundamental fermions are divided into 3\u00a0generations of 4\u00a0particles each. Half of the fermions are leptons, three of which have an electric charge of \u22121\u00a0\"e\", called the electron (), the muon (), and the tau (); the other three leptons are neutrinos (, , ), which are the only elementary fermions with neither electric nor color charge. The remaining six particles are quarks (discussed below).\nMass.\nThe following table lists current measured masses and mass estimates for all the fermions, using the same scale of measure: millions of electron-volts relative to square of light speed (MeV/\"c\"2). For example, the most accurately known quark mass is of the top quark () at , estimated using the on-shell scheme.\nEstimates of the values of quark masses depend on the version of quantum chromodynamics used to describe quark interactions. Quarks are always confined in an envelope of gluons that confer vastly greater mass to the mesons and baryons where quarks occur, so values for quark masses cannot be measured directly. Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large differences in the masses.\nAntiparticles.\nThere are also 12\u00a0fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond to these 12\u00a0particles. For example, the antielectron (positron) is the electron's antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1\u00a0\"e\".\nQuarks.\nIsolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by confinement. Every quark carries one of three color charges of the strong interaction; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles interact via gluon exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via photon exchange. Gluons are themselves color-charged, however, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the electromagnetic force, which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.\nNonetheless, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral composite particles called hadrons. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral meson. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being \"red\", another \"blue\", another \"green\". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral baryon. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors \"antired\", \"antiblue\" and \"antigreen\" can form a color-neutral antibaryon.\nQuarks also carry fractional electric charges, but, since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either \u00a0\"e\" or \u00a0\"e\", whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either \u00a0\"e\" or\u00a0\u00a0\"e\".\nEvidence for the existence of quarks comes from deep inelastic scattering: firing electrons at nuclei to determine the distribution of charge within nucleons (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the electric field around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a jet of particles is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.\nFundamental bosons.\nIn the Standard Model, vector (spin-1) bosons (gluons, photons, and the W and Z bosons) mediate forces, whereas the Higgs boson (spin-0) is responsible for the intrinsic mass of particles. Bosons differ from fermions in the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state (Pauli exclusion principle). Also, bosons can be either elementary, like photons, or a combination, like mesons. The spin of bosons are integers instead of half integers.\nGluons.\nGluons mediate the strong interaction, which join quarks and thereby form hadrons, which are either baryons (three quarks) or mesons (one quark and one antiquark). Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the atomic nucleus. Like quarks, gluons exhibit color and anticolor \u2013 unrelated to the concept of visual color and rather the particles' strong interactions \u2013 sometimes in combinations, altogether eight variations of gluons.\nElectroweak bosons.\nThere are three weak gauge bosons: W+, W\u2212, and Z0; these mediate the weak interaction. The W\u00a0bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay: The W\u2212 converts a neutron into a proton then decays into an electron and electron-antineutrino pair.\nThe Z0 does not convert particle flavor or charges, but rather changes momentum; it is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-Z exchange. The massless photon mediates the electromagnetic interaction. These four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles.\nHiggs boson.\nAlthough the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to unify as a single electroweak force at high energies. This prediction was clearly confirmed by measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at the HERA collider at DESY. The differences at low energies is a consequence of the high masses of the W and Z bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the Higgs mechanism. Through the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain with an undefined rest mass as it is always in motion (the photon). On 4 July 2012, after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its existence, the Higgs boson was announced to have been observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Peter Higgs who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson was present at the announcement. The Higgs boson is believed to have a mass of approximately . The statistical significance of this discovery was reported as 5\u00a0sigma, which implies a certainty of roughly 99.99994%. In particle physics, this is the level of significance required to officially label experimental observations as a discovery. Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues.\nGraviton.\nThe graviton is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to the difficulty inherent in its detection, it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles. The conventional graviton is massless, although some models containing massive Kaluza\u2013Klein gravitons exist.\nBeyond the Standard Model.\nAlthough experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the Standard Model, some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysterious, for instance the hierarchy problem. Theories beyond the Standard Model attempt to resolve these shortcomings.\nGrand unification.\nOne extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the electroweak interaction with the strong interaction into a single 'grand unified theory' (GUT). Such a force would be spontaneously broken into the three forces by a Higgs-like mechanism. This breakdown is theorized to occur at high energies, making it difficult to observe unification in a laboratory. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the existence of X and Y bosons, which cause proton decay. The non-observation of proton decay at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory rules out the simplest GUTs, however, including SU(5) and SO(10).\nSupersymmetry.\nSupersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the Lagrangian. These symmetries exchange fermionic particles with bosonic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of supersymmetric particles, abbreviated as \"sparticles\", which include the sleptons, squarks, neutralinos, and charginos. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose spin differs by from the ordinary particle. Due to the breaking of supersymmetry, the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing particle colliders would not be powerful enough to produce them. Some physicists believe that sparticles will be detected by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.\nString theory.\nString theory is a model of physics whereby all \"particles\" that make up matter are composed of strings (measuring at the Planck length) that exist in an 11-dimensional (according to M-theory, the leading version) or 12-dimensional (according to F-theory) universe. These strings vibrate at different frequencies that determine mass, electric charge, color charge, and spin. A \"string\" can be open (a line) or closed in a loop (a one-dimensional sphere, that is, a circle). As a string moves through space it sweeps out something called a \"world sheet\". String theory predicts 1- to 10-branes (a 1-brane being a string and a 10-brane being a 10-dimensional object) that prevent tears in the \"fabric\" of space using the uncertainty principle (e.g., the electron orbiting a hydrogen atom has the probability, albeit small, that it could be anywhere else in the universe at any given moment).\nString theory proposes that our universe is merely a 4-brane, inside which exist the three space dimensions and the one time dimension that we observe. The remaining 7\u00a0theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled up (and too small to be macroscopically accessible) or simply do not/cannot exist in our universe (because they exist in a grander scheme called the \"multiverse\" outside our known universe).\nSome predictions of the string theory include existence of extremely massive counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the fundamental string and existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like the graviton.\nTechnicolor.\nTechnicolor theories try to modify the Standard Model in a minimal way by introducing a new QCD-like interaction. This means one adds a new theory of so-called Techniquarks, interacting via so called Technigluons. The main idea is that the Higgs boson is not an elementary particle but a bound state of these objects.\nPreon theory.\nAccording to preon theory there are one or more orders of particles more fundamental than those (or most of those) found in the Standard Model. The most fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from \"pre-quarks\". In essence, preon theory tries to do for the Standard Model what the Standard Model did for the particle zoo that came before it. Most models assume that almost everything in the Standard Model can be explained in terms of three to six more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their interactions. Interest in preons has waned since the simplest models were experimentally ruled out in the 1980s.\nAcceleron theory.\nAccelerons are the hypothetical subatomic particles that integrally link the newfound mass of the neutrino to the dark energy conjectured to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.\nIn this theory, neutrinos are influenced by a new force resulting from their interactions with accelerons, leading to dark energy. Dark energy results as the universe tries to pull neutrinos apart. Accelerons are thought to interact with matter more infrequently than they do with neutrinos.\nExternal links.\nThe most important address about the current experimental and theoretical knowledge about elementary particle physics is the Particle Data Group, where different international institutions collect all experimental data and give short reviews over the contemporary theoretical understanding.\nother pages are:"}

The Marlins compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East Division. The team plays its home games at LoanDepot Park.\nThe franchise began play as an expansion team in the 1993 season as the Florida Marlins. The Marlins originally played home games at Joe Robbie Stadium, which they shared with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). In 2012, the team moved to LoanDepot Park (then known as Marlins Park), their first exclusive home and the first to be designed as a baseball park. As part of an agreement with park owner Miami-Dade County to use the stadium, the franchise also changed their name to the Miami Marlins prior to the 2012 season.\nWith a record of (), the Marlins have the lowest winning percentage and fewest postseason appearances (four) among active MLB franchises. Despite this, the Marlins won the World Series during their first two playoff runs in and . Only three players were on both World Series teams with the Marlins: Jeff Conine, Luis Castillo, and Rick Helling (both Conine and Castillo are the only Marlins to play a thousand games with the team). All four of their playoff appearances came as wild card teams, making them one of two MLB franchises (along with the Colorado Rockies) to have never won a division title, as well as the only franchise to have never appeared in back-to-back postseasons. The Marlins were also the first team to win the World Series as a wild card. The Marlins have no retired numbers, with the exception of Jackie Robinson's universally retired #42 in 1997.\nHistory.\nWayne Huizenga, CEO of Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, was awarded an expansion franchise in the National League (NL) for a $95\u00a0million expansion fee and the team began operations in 1993 as the Florida Marlins. MLB had announced a few months earlier that it intended to add two new teams to the National League. It was a foregone conclusion that one of them would be placed in Florida; the only question was whether Huizenga would beat out competing groups from Orlando and Tampa Bay. Orlando waged a very spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa Bay already had a baseball park\u2014the Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, completed in 1990. However, on June 10, , the National League awarded a Miami-based franchise to Huizenga. The franchise adopted the nickname \"Marlins\" from previous minor league teams, the Miami Marlins of the Triple-A 's International League from 1956 to 1960, and the Miami Marlins (1962\u201370) and Miami Marlins (1982\u201388) teams that played in the Florida State League.\nThe Marlins' first manager was Rene Lachemann, a former catcher who had previously managed the Seattle Mariners and Milwaukee Brewers, and who at the time of his hiring was a third base coach for the Oakland Athletics. The team drafted its initial lineup of players in the 1992 MLB Expansion Draft. The Marlins defeated the Houston Astros 12\u20138 in their inaugural spring training game. Jeff Conine hit Florida's first homer before a crowd of 6,696 at the Cocoa Expo Sports Complex. The Marlins won their first game on April 5, , against the Dodgers. Charlie Hough was the starting pitcher for that game. Jeff Conine went 4-for-4 as well, making him an immediate crowd favorite. By the end of his tenure with Florida, he had earned the nickname \"Mr. Marlin.\" Gary Sheffield and Bryan Harvey represented the Marlins as the club's first All-Star Game selections, and Sheffield homered in the Marlins' first All-Star Game at-bat. The team finished the year five games ahead of the last-place New York Mets and with an attendance of 3,064,847. In that season, the Marlins traded young set-up reliever Trevor Hoffman and two minor-league prospects to the San Diego Padres for third baseman Gary Sheffield. While Sheffield helped Florida immediately and became an all-star, Hoffman eventually emerged as the best closer in the National League. After the 1993 season, Donald A. Smiley was named the second president in club history. The Marlins finished last (51\u201364) in their division in the strike-shortened season of and fourth (67\u201376) in . Lachemann was replaced as manager midway through the by director of player development John Boles.\n1997: First World Series title.\nFollowing an 80\u201382 record in 1996, former Pittsburgh Pirates manager Jim Leyland was hired to lead the club heading into 1997.\nIn 1997, the Marlins finished nine games back of the Division Champion Atlanta Braves, but earned the wild card berth. Veteran additions such as LF Mois\u00e9s Alou, 3B Bobby Bonilla, and trade-deadline additions Darren Daulton and Jim Eisenreich added experience and clutch hits. Talented young stars Luis Castillo (2B) and \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda (SS) comprised one of the best double play combos in the NL. The Marlins swept the San Francisco Giants 3\u20130 in the National League Division Series, and then went on to beat the Atlanta Braves 4\u20132 in the National League Championship Series, overcoming the loss of Alex Fernandez to a torn rotator cuff, and Kevin Brown to a virus. Brown's place was taken in Game 5 by rookie pitcher Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez, who struck out 15 Braves and outdueled multiple Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux to a 2\u20131 victory. The underdog Marlins went on to face the Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series, and won in seven games. In Game 7, Craig Counsell's sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth tied the game at 2, then, with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 11th, \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda's soft liner glanced off the glove of Cleveland pitcher Charles Nagy and into center field to score Counsell and give the Marlins the win.\n2003: Second World Series victory.\nOn May 9, the Marlins called up high-kicking southpaw Dontrelle Willis from the Double-A Carolina Mudcats and helped carry the injury-plagued Marlins with an 11\u20132 record in his first 17 starts. Miguel Cabrera (also from the Mudcats) filled in well, hitting a walk-off home run in his first major league game, against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Pro Player Stadium. Both Willis and Cabrera would later prove to be essential parts of the Marlin's playoff success. Jeff Conine \u2013 an original Marlin and member of the 1997 World Series team \u2013 returned from Baltimore, Hall of Fame catcher Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez signed with the Marlins as a free agent and closer Ugueth Urbina arrived from the Texas Rangers. These acquisitions helped to keep the team in contention, and although they finished ten games behind the Braves, the Marlins captured the NL wild card.\nOn October 15, the Marlins defeated the Chicago Cubs four games to three in the 2003 National League Championship Series, coming back from a 3\u20131 deficit. Game 6 saw the Marlins play a role in one of baseball's most infamous moments, the Steve Bartman incident. With one out in the eighth inning and the Cubs three runs ahead, Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo hit a pop foul a row into the stands along the third baseline. Cubs fan Steve Bartman reached for the ball, preventing Cubs left fielder Mois\u00e9s Alou from making the out and setting off an eight-run Marlins rally. The incident with Bartman and a come-from-behind win in Wrigley Field in Game 7 helped the Marlins capture their second NL pennant, keeping the \"Curse of the Billy Goat\" alive and well.\nIn the 2003 World Series, the Marlins defeated the heavily favored New York Yankees in six games, winning the sixth game in Yankee Stadium. Shortstop \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez helped the Marlins in Game 4 of the series with a walk-off home run in extra innings. Josh Beckett was named the Most Valuable Player for the series after twirling a five-hit complete-game shutout in Game 6. Skipper Jack McKeon became the oldest manager ever to win a World Series title.\n2012\u2013present.\nIn 2012, the team moved from the football-oriented Sun Life Stadium (located in Miami Gardens) to Marlins Park in downtown Miami. As a condition of the move, the team was renamed the Miami Marlins, and adopted a new logo and colors. On November 16, 2017, Giancarlo Stanton won the National League MVP, becoming the first Marlin to win the award.\nDuring the 2020 shortened season, the Marlins finished with a 31\u201329 overall record and 2nd place in the NL East. In the Wild Card Series they swept the Chicago Cubs in 2 games. Miami loss in three games to the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS.\nOn November 13, 2020, the Marlins became the first club in any American major-level sports league to hire a woman to an executive position when Kim Ng was announced as the team's general manager. In addition, she will also be MLB's first Asian American general manager. On February 28, 2022, it was announced Derek Jeter stepped down as CEO of the Marlins. On September 30, 2023, with the Marlins 7\u20133 win in Pittsburgh, the Marlins clinched their fourth postseason berth, making Kim Ng the first woman GM in MLB history to lead a playoff team.\nUniform history.\n1993\u20132002.\nThe Florida Marlins debuted wearing three different uniforms. The primary and alternate home uniforms shared the same design: \"Marlins\" (with an underline after the letter \"S\") in teal with black trim and letters were rendered in black with teal trim, along with teal pinstripes. The alternate home uniforms were sleeveless, and teal undershirts were added to the ensemble. The road uniforms featured \"Florida\" (with the marlin wrapped around the letter \"F\") in teal with black trim and letters were rendered in black with teal trim. The primary logo patch was placed on the left sleeve. The Marlins wore three different cap designs, all featuring the \"F\" insignia in front of a leaping marlin. The all-teal home cap and the black-brimmed teal road cap were initially the primary headwear the team used, with the all-black cap as the alternate.\nBy the late 1990s, teal was gradually de-emphasized and the Marlins wore black caps and undershirts for the remainder of the uniform's run.\n2003\u20132011.\nThe Marlins introduced new uniforms before its second World Series-winning season. On the home uniforms, teal was relegated to accent color status with black the primary lettering and pinstripe color. Silver accents were also added to the letters. A sleeved alternate pinstriped home uniform replaced the original sleeveless version, sharing the same design as the primary home uniform except with the \"F\" logo on the left chest. The \"F\" logo also took its place on the left sleeve in place of the primary logo. Road uniforms again featured \"Florida\" but shared the same script look and color scheme as the home uniform (with an underline after the letter \"A\"). White accents were added to the letters. In addition, the Marlins began wearing a black alternate uniform, featuring the same \"Marlins\" script but in silver with teal, black and white accents. Both alternate uniforms lacked the front chest numbers.\nIn 2010, the Marlins changed its road uniform design, replacing \"Florida\" with \"Marlins\". The sleeve logo patches were also removed.\n2012\u20132018.\nRebranding as the Miami Marlins, the team introduced a new color scheme with orange, black and blue. The \"M\" insignia is white with orange, yellow and sky blue accents, along with a stylized abstract marlin on top. This logo served as a cap logo as well as a patch on the left sleeve. The primary home, road and black alternate uniforms all feature \"Miami\" in front, with the first \"M\" shaped similarly to the cap and sleeve logos. The home and road uniform feature black letters with silver trim, along with orange drop shadows on the numbers, while the alternate black uniform feature white letters with silver trim and orange numbers with silver trim and black drop shadows. The orange alternate uniform featured the team name in white with sky blue accents; however the abstract marlin was located atop the letter \"I\". Letters were black with silver trim, while sky blue drop shadows were featured on the numbers. The Marlins primarily wore all-black caps, though for a brief period they wore alternate all-orange caps.\nSince 2019.\nThe Marlins released updated logos and color schemes, replacing orange and silver with bright Caliente red, Miami blue and slate grey. Home and road uniforms contain 'Miami\" and letters in black with red drop shadows and blue accents, while the black alternate uniform contain \"Marlins\" and letters in black with red drop shadows and blue accents. The cap logo, used on the all-black cap, is a stylized \"M\" with a more realistic marlin on top. The Marlin logo also appears on the left sleeve.\nIn 2021, the Marlins unveiled a City Connect uniform. The primarily red uniform with Miami blue trim paid homage to the Cuban Sugar Kings.\nIn 2024, the Marlins updated their black alternate uniform, changing the letters to white in order to improve visibility. They also introduced a new Miami blue alternate uniform, featuring the black \"Marlins\" lettering with white trim and red drop shadows. This was originally their Spring Training uniform, albeit with the \"M\" logo on the left chest.\nRivalry.\nCitrus Series.\nThe Rays also have a geographical, interleague rivalry with the Miami Marlins. Tampa Bay currently leads the series, 81\u201360.\nWorld Series championships.\nThe Marlins won the World Series in 1997 and 2003, but both titles were followed by controversial periods where the team sold off all the high-priced players and rebuilt. Between 2003 and 2019, the team's two World Series runs also marked their sole postseason appearances. Their three playoff qualifications and seven winning seasons are the fewest among MLB franchises.\nDespite never winning a division title, the Florida Marlins is the only team to make the playoffs and win a World Series in its first two winning seasons.\nAchievements.\nRetired numbers.\nFrom 1993 until 2011, the Marlins had retired the number 5 in honor of Carl Barger, the first president of the Florida Marlins, who had died prior to the team's inaugural season. Barger's favorite player was Joe DiMaggio, thus the selection of number 5. With the move to LoanDepot Park, the team opted to honor Barger with a plaque instead, and opened number 5 to circulation. Logan Morrison, a Kansas City native and fan of Royals Hall-of-Famer George Brett (who wore that number with the Royals), became the first Marlins player to wear the number. As of 2024, the Marlins are the only franchise with no retired numbers for former players, and while seven former players are in the Hall of Fame, none wear a Marlins cap on their plaque or have the Marlins listed as their primary team.\nAfter Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez's death as a result of a boating accident on September 25, 2016, the Miami Marlins built a memorial at LoanDepot Park in his honor, which displays his number 16. Fern\u00e1ndez's number has yet to be officially retired, but remains inactive.\nMarlins Legends Hall of Fame.\nOn February 9, 2025, the Marlins announced its Legends Hall of Fame, which honors former players, coaches, managers and staff members who made significant achievements and contributions to the organization and South Florida community. The 2025 inaugural Hall of Fame class features four members, each of whom will be inducted during certain points of the season.\nMinor league affiliations.\nThe Miami Marlins farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.\nRadio and television.\nThe Marlins' flagship radio station from their inception in 1993 through 2007 was WQAM 560\u00a0AM. Although the Marlins had plans to leave WQAM after 2006, they remained with WQAM for the 2007 season. On October 11, 2007, the Marlins announced an agreement with WAXY 790\u00a0AM to broadcast all games for the 2008 season. Longtime Montreal Expo and current Marlins play-by-play radio announcer Dave Van Horne won the Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award for excellence in baseball broadcasting in 2010. He shares the play-by-play duties with Glenn Geffner.\nGames are also broadcast in Spanish on Radio Mambi 710\u00a0AM. Felo Ram\u00edrez called play-by-play on that station from 1993 to 2017 along with Luis Quintana, won the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001.\nMarlins games are televised by Bally Sports Florida. Paul Severino serves as the play-by-play announcer with Tommy Hutton, J.P. Arencibia, Gaby S\u00e1nchez and Jeff Nelson. Jessica Blaylock host's \"Marlins Live\" and is the Marlins on site reporter.\nCulture.\nIn 1989, \"Back to the Future Part II\" had a reference to the Chicago Cubs defeating a baseball team from Miami in the 2015 World Series, ending the longest championship drought in all four of the major North American professional sports leagues. In actuality, the Cubs would end up getting swept in four games by the New York Mets in the NLCS, the Marlins failed to make the postseason, and the 2015 World Series was between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets, with the Royals winning in five games. Also, both the Cubs and Marlins are part of the National League, rendering a World Series matchup between the two teams impossible.\nThe Marlins were the first team in Major League Baseball to have a dance/cheer team. Debuting in 2003, the \"Marlins Mermaids\" influenced other MLB teams to develop their own cheer/dance squads. In 2008, the Florida Marlins debuted \"The Marlins Manatees\", Major League Baseball's first all-male dance/energy squad, to star alongside the Mermaids. As of 2012, the Marlins have abandoned the \"Mermaids\" and \"Manatees\" for in-game entertainment instead using an \"energy squad\", a co-ed group of dancers. In 2019, the Marlins brought back the Mermaids for the first time since 2012.\nThe Marlins have had many official anthems over the years, performed by such artists as Pitbull, DJ Khaled, Poo Bear and Creed frontman Scott Stapp. Stapp penned their 2010 anthem Marlins Will Soar.\nOn July 16, 2022, the Marlins became the second NL team to form a cheering section for fans when it opened \"Sandy's Beach\" at Section 22 of LoanDepot Park for supporters of team starter Sandy Alcantara. Fans assigned to this section, located near the 3rd base line, wear beach related clothing in an nod to the city's famous beaches whenever Sandy pitchers on select game days.\nFinishes.\nBest finishes in franchise history.\nThe following are the five best seasons in Marlins history:\nWorst finishes in franchise history.\nThe following are the five worst seasons in Marlins' history:\nHome attendance.\nOther than their first few years as a franchise in the 1990s, the Marlins have consistently ranked as one of lowest attendance teams in the league, coming in last place (30th) several of the past 20 years. Even when LoanDepot Park was completed for the 2012 season, attendance was only average for the first year, dropping down to second to last by 2013.\nFinance.\nOpening Day salaries.\nOpening Day payrolls for 25-man roster (since 1993):\nAnnual financial records.\nThe annual financial records of the Marlins according to \"Forbes\" since 2001."}
{"id": "11281", "revid": "45330940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11281", "title": "Frontline (Australian TV series)", "text": "Frontline is an Australian comedy television series which satirised Australian television current affairs programmes and reporting. It ran for three series of 13 half-hour episodes and was broadcast on ABC TV in 1994, 1995 and 1997.\nProduction.\nThe series was written, directed and produced by Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro, Rob Sitch and Tom Gleisner. They created and performed in the television shows \"The D-Generation\" and \"The Late Show\" before creating \"Frontline\" (as well as \"Funky Squad\" between series 1 and 2 of \"Frontline\"). After \"Frontline\" they moved into feature films, making several popular Australian movies including \"The Castle\" and \"The Dish\", and hosted \"The Panel\" for several years, before moving on to \"Thank God You're Here\" and later \"Have You Been Paying Attention?\".\nThe series was partly inspired by a \"60 Minutes\" special \"Has the media gone too far?\". It bears some similarity to the UK series \"Drop the Dead Donkey\".\nSetting.\nA commercial network.\nThe series follows the fortunes of a fictional current affairs show, \"Frontline\". In the show, \"Frontline\" competes directly with Nine's \"A Current Affair\" and Seven's \"Real Life\", which changed its name to \"Today Tonight\" from 1995 onwards.\nThe \"Frontline\" office showcases and satirises the machinations of the ruthless producers, the self-obsessed airhead host, and the ambitious, cynical reporters, all of whom resort to any sort of underhanded trick to get ratings and maintain their status\u2014including the use of hidden cameras, foot-in-the-door, bullying interview techniques, and chequebook journalism. They ingratiate themselves with the all-powerful network bosses, while the real work is in fact done by their long-suffering production staff.\nThe station itself also runs other television shows referenced by \"Frontline\" staff, such as 6 o'clock news program, a 3-hour news review show \"Sunday Forum\", a sketch show \"The Komedy Bunch\", a game show \"Jackpot\", a teen soap opera \"Sunshine Cove\" which later changed to \"Rainbow Island\", also lesser mentioned shows such as the football show \"Ball-to-Ball\", \"Late-Night OZ\", \"Cartoon Crazies\", \"The Morning Show\", \"Face the Press\" and \"Vacation\".\nAs a commentary.\nThe characters and situations were often thinly-disguised parodies of recent real events and real people, giving the show's comedy a black edge. In particular, the Season 1 episode \"The Siege\" was a replay of a controversial real life incident which had occurred just a few months earlier, told as though \"Frontline\" itself had covered the story.\nThe dim-witted, egotistical host Mike Moore was a parody of current television hosts and journalists. Sitch has claimed that none of the characters were directly based on a single person, and indeed the character of Moore was a combination of well-known characteristics of a number of high-profile television figures, including \"A Current Affair\" host Ray Martin, Martin's predecessor Mike Willesee, and \"Real Life\" host Stan Grant.\nThe ABC's media review show \"Media Watch\" was featured prominently. Much of the real life journalistic misconduct reported on \"Media Watch\" later appeared on \"Frontline\" in fictionalised form. One example of this was when \"Media Watch\" reported that Dave \"Sluggo\" Richardson had made a highly misleading report on Christopher Skase for \"Today Tonight\". Richardson was suspended from duty for a month, and in the \"One Rule for One\" episode of \"Frontline\", fictional reporter Martin di Stasio is suspended for a month for doing exactly the same thing.\nMultiple episodes of \"Frontline\" featured \"Media Watch\" segments criticising the show.\nCharacters.\nSpecial guests.\n\"Frontline\" frequently featured celebrity cameos, unusually including major Australian politicians appearing as themselves, often but not always as interviewees. The most memorable appearance is that of Pauline Hanson in \"The Shadow We Cast\" (series 3), in which she turns her famous \"please explain?\" phrase on Mike. Noel Pearson appears as an interviewee later in the same episode. Other appearances include: John Hewson in \"The Souffl\u00e9 Rises\" (series 1); Pat Cash in \"The Desert Angel\"; Cheryl Kernot in \"We Ain't Got Dames\" (series 1); Ben Elton, Bert Newton, Rosemary Margan, Amanda Keller and Anne Fulwood in \"This Night of Nights\" (series 1); Glenn Ridge in \"Add Sex and Stir\" and \"Office Mole\" (series 2); Glenn Robbins and Molly Meldrum in \"Add Sex and Stir\"; George Negus in \"Add Sex and Stir\" and \"Dick on the Line\" (series 3); and Ian Baker-Finch in \"A Hole in the Heart\". Harry Shearer appeared in the series 2 episode \"Changing the Face of Current Affairs\", where he played the character of Larry Hadges. Merv Hughes also starred in the series 2 episode \"Workin' Class Man\".\nOther guest stars appeared in mock-ups of their own shows: Mike Moore appeared on fictitious episodes of \"Burke's Backyard\" with Don Burke, Rex Hunt's fishing show, and \"The AFL Footy Show\" with Sam Newman. Stuart Littlemore, who at the time was hosting the media commentary show \"Media Watch\", appeared in several fictitious episodes as a critic of \"Frontline\".\nProduction strategies.\n\"Frontline\" broke new ground for Australian situation comedy, by adopting some innovative production strategies. Its rapid production schedule was inspired by UK series \"Drop the Dead Donkey\", where each episode was written and taped in a single week and scripts were closely based on the real news stories of the preceding seven days.\nThe \"Frontline\" scripts were likewise written and the series filmed with a short period, often within a single week. It was a fully collaborative effort, with Cilauro, Kennedy, Gleisner and Sitch all sharing writing and directing duties, and the cast all contributing ideas during all stages of production. So sometimes when the show appeared on then-current events, it was a coincidence, as episodes were delayed by several months. In other cases there was direct commentary on real events, albeit not extremely recent ones.\nTo create a heightened illusion of grainy documentary realism, footage was shot under fluorescent lights in an actual office building set, and taped on hand-held Hi-8 camcorders usually operated by Gleisner and Cilauro. The footage was then transferred onto film and finally transferred back to videotape (see: Kinescope). Footage that was portrayed as being part of the \"Frontline\" broadcast (i.e., studio or field reports) was shot at broadcast quality, to increase the \"realism\" of the satire and complement the behind-the-scenes footage.\nOther airings.\nIn 1997, Channel Seven bought the rights to the series; however, they only aired a handful of episodes. The show was perceived by management as \"too close to the bone\" for a network significantly focused upon its prime-time current affairs ratings battle with rival stations. The Comedy Channel has shown the series as late as 2005. It was shown again on ABC TV in 2018 and in 2020\u201321.\nIn America, \"Frontline\" was shown as either \"Behind the Frontline\" on cable or as \"Breaking News\" on PBS (which already has a news series titled \"Frontline\").\nIn the UK, series 1 and 2 were shown by the Paramount Comedy Channel. Series 3, however, was never screened.\nIn Canada, it was aired as \"Behind the Frontline\" on Showcase in 1997.\nImpact.\nThe series was extremely popular through its run, winning a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Achievement in Comedy in 1995, and a Logie for Alison Whyte as most outstanding actress in 1997. Critics often place Frontline at or near the top of lists of \"the best Australian TV shows ever made\".\nSix episodes from series one were a core text in the Year 12 English Advanced syllabus for the Higher School Certificate in New South Wales (2000\u20132008) for Module C: Representation and Text: Elective 1: Telling the Truth. The episodes are \"Playing the Ego Card\", \"Add Sex and Stir\", \"The Siege\", \"Smaller Fish to Fry\", \"We Ain't Got Dames\", and \"This Night of Nights\". The show has also been used as a text response for both Years 11 and 12 in the English units of the Victorian Certificate of Education. Episodes of \"Frontline\" have been analysed for the Media topic in the Year 10 English syllabus in New South Wales since at least 2001 and in Western Australia since at least 2009.\nMentalAs campaign.\nIn October 2014, Sitch reprised the role of Mike Moore and \"Frontline\" during a short sketch on the \"Friday Night Crack Up\" as part of the ABC's \"MentalAs\" campaign to raise money and awareness for mental health issues."}
{"id": "11282", "revid": "8524693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11282", "title": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat", "text": "Claude-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat (; ; 30 June 1801 \u2013 24 December 1850) was a French economist, writer and a prominent member of the French liberal school.\nA member of the French National Assembly, Bastiat developed the economic concept of opportunity cost and introduced the parable of the broken window. He was described as \"the most brilliant economic journalist who ever lived\" by economic theorist Joseph Schumpeter.\nAs an advocate of classical economics and the economics of Adam Smith, his views favored a free market and influenced the Austrian School. He is best known for his book \"The Law\", where he argued that law must protect rights such as private property, not \"plunder\" others' property.\nBiography.\nBastiat was born on 29 June 1801 in Bayonne, Aquitaine, a port town in the south of France on the Bay of Biscay. His father, Pierre Bastiat, was a prominent businessman in the town. His mother died in 1808 when Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was seven years old. His father moved inland to the town of Mugron, with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric following soon afterward. The Bastiat estate in Mugron had been acquired during the French Revolution and had previously belonged to the Marquis of Poyanne. Pierre Bastiat died in 1810, leaving Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric an orphan. He was fostered by his paternal grandfather and his unmarried aunt Justine Bastiat. He attended a school in Bayonne, but his aunt thought poorly of it and so enrolled him in the school Saint-Sever. At age 17, he left school at Sor\u00e8ze to work for his uncle in his family's export business. It was the same firm where his father had been a partner.\nBastiat began to develop an intellectual interest as he no longer wished to work with his uncle and desired to go to Paris for formal studies. This hope was not realized as his grandfather was in poor health and wished to go to the Mugron estate. Bastiat accompanied him and cared for him. The next year when Bastiat was 24, his grandfather died, leaving him the family estate, thereby providing him with the means to further his theoretical inquiries. Bastiat developed intellectual interests in several areas including philosophy, history, politics, religion, travel, poetry, political economy and biography. After the middle-class Revolution of 1830, Bastiat became politically active and was elected justice of the peace of Mugron in 1831 and to the Council General (county-level assembly) of Landes in 1832. Bastiat was elected to the national legislative assembly after the French Revolution of 1848.\nHis public career as an economist began only in 1844, when his first article was published in the \"Journal des \u00e9conomistes\" during October of that year and it was ended by his untimely death in 1850. Bastiat contracted tuberculosis, probably during his tours throughout France to promote his ideas and that illness eventually prevented him from making further speeches (particularly at the legislative assembly to which he was elected in 1848 and 1849) and ended his life. In \"The Law\", he wrote: \"Until the day of my death, I shall proclaim this principle with all the force of my lungs (which alas! is all too inadequate)\".\nThis last line is understood by translators to be a reference to the effects of his tuberculosis. During the autumn of 1850, he was sent to Italy by his doctors, and he first traveled to Pisa, then to Rome. On 24 December 1850, Bastiat called those with him to approach his bed and murmured twice the words \"the truth\" before he died at the age of 49.\nWorks.\nBastiat was the author of many works on economics and political economy, generally characterized by their clear organization, forceful argumentation and acerbic wit. Economist Murray Rothbard wrote that \"Bastiat was indeed a lucid and superb writer, whose brilliant and witty essays and fables to this day are remarkable and devastating demolitions of protectionism and of all forms of government subsidy and control. He was a truly scintillating advocate of an unrestricted free market\". However, Bastiat himself declared that subsidy should be available, albeit limited under extraordinary circumstances, saying the following: \"Under extraordinary circumstances, for urgent cases, the State should set aside some resources to assist certain unfortunate people, to help them adjust to changing conditions\".\nAmong his better-known works is \"Economic Sophisms\", a series of essays (originally published in the \"Journal des \u00e9conomistes\") which contain a defence of free trade. Bastiat wrote the work while living in England to advise the shapers of the French Republic on perils to avoid. \"Economic Sophisms\" was translated and adapted for an American readership in 1867 by the economist and historian of money Alexander del Mar, writing under the pseudonym Emile Walter.\n\"Economic Sophisms\" and the candlemakers' petition.\nContained within \"Economic Sophisms\" is the satirical parable known as the candlemakers' petition in which candlemakers and tallow producers lobby the Chamber of Deputies of the French July Monarchy (1830\u20131848) to block out the Sun to prevent its unfair competition with their products. Also included in the \"Sophisms\" is a facetious petition to the king asking for a law forbidding the usage of everyone's right hand, based on a presumption by some of his contemporaries that more difficulty means more work and more work means more wealth.\n\"The Law\" (1850).\nBastiat's most famous work is \"The Law\", originally published as a pamphlet in 1850. It defines a just system of laws and then demonstrates how such law facilitates a free society. In \"The Law\", Bastiat wrote that everyone has a right to protect \"his person, his liberty, and his property\". The state should be only a \"substitution of a common force for individual forces\" to defend this right. According to Bastiat, justice (meaning defense of one's life, liberty and property) has precise limits, but if government power extends further into philanthropic endeavors, then government becomes so limitless that it can grow endlessly. The resulting statism is \"based on this triple hypothesis: the total inertness of mankind, the omnipotence of the law, and the infallibility of the legislator\". The public then becomes socially engineered by the legislator and must bend to the legislators' will \"like the clay to the potter\", saying: Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.\nI do not dispute their right to invent social combinations, to advertise them, to advocate them, and to try them upon themselves, at their own expense and risk. But I do dispute their right to impose these plans upon us by law \u2013 by force \u2013 and to compel us to pay for them with our taxes.\nBastiat posits that the law becomes perverted when it punishes one's right to self-defense (of his life, liberty and property) in favor of another's right to legalized plunder which he defines as \"if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime\" in which he includes the tax support of \"protective tariffs, subsidies, guaranteed profits, guaranteed jobs, relief and welfare schemes, public education, progressive taxation, free credit, and public works\". According to Bastiat, legal plunder can be committed in \"an infinite number of ways. Thus, we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole \u2014 with their common aim of legal plunder \u2014 constitute socialism\". Bastiat also made the following humorous point: \"If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free, how is it that the tendencies of these organizers are always good? Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race? Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind?\"\n\"What is Seen and What is Not Seen\".\nIn his 1850 essay \"Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas\" (\"What is seen and what is not seen\"), Bastiat introduced through the parable of the broken window the concept of opportunity cost in all but name. This term was not coined until over sixty years after his death by Friedrich von Wieser in 1914.\nDebate with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.\nBastiat also famously engaged in a debate between 1849 and 1850 with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon about the legitimacy of interest. As Robert Leroux argued, Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhon's anti-interest doctrine \"was the complete antithesis of any serious approach\". Proudhon famously lost his temper and resorted to personal attacks: \"Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do not hear anything, you do not understand anything. You are without philosophy, without science, without humanity. Your ability to reason, like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero. Scientifically, Mr. Bastiat, you are a dead man.\"\nViews.\nBastiat asserted that the sole purpose of government is to protect the right of an individual to life, liberty and property and that it is dangerous and morally wrong for government to interfere with an individual's other personal matters. From this, Bastiat concluded that the law cannot defend life, liberty and property if it promotes legal or legalized plunder which he defined as using government force and laws to take something from one individual and give it to others (as opposed to a transfer of property via mutually agreed contracts without using fraud or violent threats against the other party, which Bastiat considered a legitimate transfer of property).\nIn \"The Law\", Bastiat explains that if the privileged classes or socialists use the government for legalized plunder, this will encourage the other socioeconomic class to also use legal plunder and that the correct response to the socialists is to cease all legal plunder. Bastiat also explains why his opinion is that the law cannot defend life, liberty and property if it promotes socialist policies. When used to obtain legalized plunder for any group, he says that the law is perverted against the only things (life, liberty and property) it is supposed to defend.\nBastiat was a strong supporter of free trade who was inspired by and routinely corresponded with Richard Cobden and the English Anti-Corn Law League and worked with free-trade associations in France.\nBecause of his emphasis on the mutual gains to be had from free exchange, on subjective value, and on the importance of deductive reasoning (as opposed to mathematical models) in deriving economic conclusions, Bastiat has been described by Mark Thornton, Thomas DiLorenzo and other economists as a forerunner of the Austrian School, with Thornton positing that through taking this position on the motivations of human action he demonstrates a pronounced \"Austrian flavor.\"\nBastiat's tomb.\nBastiat died in Rome and is buried at San Luigi dei Francesi in the center of that city."}
{"id": "11283", "revid": "42964511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11283", "title": "Falsifiability", "text": "Falsifiability (or refutability) is a deductive standard of evaluation of scientific theories and hypotheses, introduced by the philosopher of science Karl Popper in his book \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\" (1934). A theory or hypothesis is falsifiable if it can be logically contradicted by an empirical test.\nPopper emphasized the asymmetry created by the relation of a universal law with basic observation statements and contrasted falsifiability to the intuitively similar concept of \"verifiability\" that was then current in logical positivism. He argued that the only way to verify a claim such as \"All swans are white\" would be if one could theoretically observe all swans, which is not possible. On the other hand, the falsifiability requirement for an anomalous instance, such as the observation of a single black swan, is theoretically reasonable and sufficient to logically falsify the claim. \nPopper proposed falsifiability as the cornerstone solution to both the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation. He insisted that, as a logical criterion, his falsifiability is distinct from the related concept \"capacity to be proven wrong\" discussed in Lakatos's falsificationism. Even being a logical criterion, its purpose is to make the theory predictive and testable, and thus useful in practice.\nBy contrast, the Duhem\u2013Quine thesis says that definitive experimental falsifications are impossible and that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions, because an empirical test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions.\nPopper's response is that falsifiability does not have the Duhem problem because it is a logical criterion. Experimental research has the Duhem problem and other problems, such as the problem of induction, but, according to Popper, statistical tests, which are only possible when a theory is falsifiable, can still be useful within a critical discussion.\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science and pseudoscience, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent. However, falsifiability is not a sufficient condition for demarcating science as theories have to actually be tested in order to eliminate theories that are wrong. In scientific practice, this can cause theories to change from being falsified back to unfalsified, such as when the once-falsified geocentric world view was restored as a viable reference frame within special relativity. There is ambiguity surrounding the status of theories that cannot currently be tested.\nThe problem of induction and demarcation.\nOne of the questions in the scientific method is: how does one move from observations to scientific laws? This is the problem of induction. Suppose we want to put the hypothesis that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue (or \"induce\") from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a logical fallacy such as, for example, affirming the consequent.\nPopper's idea to solve this problem is that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that \"not\" every swan is white. Such falsification uses the valid inference \"modus tollens\": if from a law formula_1 we logically deduce formula_2, but what is observed is formula_3, we infer that the law formula_1 is false. For example, given the statement formula_5 \"all swans are white\", we can deduce formula_6 \"the specific swan here is white\", but if what is observed is formula_7 \"the specific swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false. More accurately, the statement formula_2 that can be deduced is broken into an initial condition and a prediction as in formula_9 in which formula_10 \"the thing here is a swan\" and formula_11 \"the thing here is a white swan\". If what is observed is C being true while P is false (formally, formula_12), we can infer that the law is false.\nFor Popper, induction is actually never needed in science. Instead, in Popper's view, laws are conjectured in a non-logical manner on the basis of expectations and predispositions. This has led David Miller, a student and collaborator of Popper, to write \"the mission is to classify truths, not to certify them\". In contrast, the logical empiricism movement, which included such philosophers as Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, and A. J. Ayer wanted to formalize the idea that, for a law to be scientific, it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity. There was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that, but the thought expressed by Mach's dictum that \"where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned\" was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science.\nPopper said that a demarcation criterion was possible, but we have to use the \"logical possibility\" of falsifications, which is falsifiability. He cited his encounter with psychoanalysis in the 1910s. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true. A verification has no value in itself. But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all. In the definition of falsifiability, contradictions with observations are not used to support eventual falsifications, but for \"logical\" \"falsifications\" that show that the law makes risky predictions, which is completely different.\nOn the basic philosophical side of this issue, Popper said that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless. In opposition to this view, Popper said that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation.\nFrom Hume's problem to non problematic induction.\nThe problem of induction is often called Hume's problem. David Hume studied how human beings obtain new knowledge that goes beyond known laws and observations, including how we can discover new laws. He understood that deductive logic could not explain this learning process and argued in favour of a mental or psychological process of learning that would not require deductive logic. He even argued that this learning process cannot be justified by any general rules, deductive or not. Popper accepted Hume's argument and therefore viewed progress in science as the result of quasi-induction, which does the same as induction, but has no inference rules to justify it. Philip N. Johnson-Laird, professor of psychology, also accepted Hume's conclusion that induction has no justification. For him induction does not require justification and therefore can exist in the same manner as Popper's quasi-induction does.\nWhen Johnson-Laird says that no justification is needed, he does not refer to a general inductive method of justification that, to avoid a circular reasoning, would not itself require any justification. On the contrary, in agreement with Hume, he means that there is no general method of justification for induction and that's ok, because the induction steps do not require justification. Instead, these steps use patterns of induction, which are not expected to have a general justification: they may or may not be applicable depending on the background knowledge. Johnson-Laird wrote: \"[P]hilosophers have worried about which properties of objects warrant inductive inferences. The answer rests on knowledge: we don't infer that all the passengers on a plane are male because the first ten off the plane are men. We know that this observation doesn't rule out the possibility of a woman passenger.\" The reasoning pattern that was not applied here is enumerative induction.\nPopper was interested in the overall learning process in science, to quasi-induction, which he also called the \"path of science\". However, Popper did not show much interest in these reasoning patterns, which he globally referred to as psychologism. He did not deny the possibility of some kind of psychological explanation for the learning process, especially when psychology is seen as an extension of biology, but he felt that these biological explanations were not within the scope of epistemology. Popper proposed an evolutionary mechanism to explain the success of science, which is much in line with Johnson-Laird's view that \"induction is just something that animals, including human beings, do to make life possible\", but Popper did not consider it a part of his epistemology. He wrote that his interest was mainly in the \"logic\" of science and that epistemology should be concerned with logical aspects only. Instead of asking why science succeeds he considered the pragmatic problem of induction. This problem is not how to justify a theory or what is the global mechanism for the success of science but only what methodology do we use to pick one theory among theories that are already conjectured. His methodological answer to the latter question is that we pick the theory that is the most tested with the available technology: \"the one, which in the light of our \"critical discussion\", appears to be the best so far\". By his own account, because only a negative approach was supported by logic, Popper adopted a negative methodology. The purpose of his methodology is to prevent \"the policy of immunizing our theories against refutation\". It also supports some \"dogmatic attitude\" in defending theories against criticism, because this allows the process to be more complete. This negative view of science was much criticized and not only by Johnson-Laird.\nIn practice, some steps based on observations can be justified under assumptions, which can be very natural. For example, Bayesian inductive logic is justified by theorems that make explicit assumptions. These theorems are obtained with deductive logic, not inductive logic. They are sometimes presented as steps of induction, because they refer to laws of probability, even though they do not go beyond deductive logic. This is yet a third notion of induction, which overlaps with deductive logic in the following sense that it is supported by it. These deductive steps are not really inductive, but the overall process that includes the creation of assumptions is inductive in the usual sense. In a fallibilist perspective, a perspective that is widely accepted by philosophers, including Popper, every logical step of learning only creates an assumption or reinstates one that was doubted\u2014that is all that science logically does.\nThe elusive distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.\nPopper distinguished between the logic of science and its applied \"methodology\". For example, the falsifiability of Newton's law of gravitation, as defined by Popper, depends purely on the logical relation it has with a statement such as \"The brick fell upwards when released\". A brick that falls upwards would not alone falsify Newton's law of gravitation. The capacity to verify the absence of conditions such as a hidden string attached to the brick is also needed for this state of affairs to eventually falsify Newton's law of gravitation. However, these applied methodological considerations are irrelevant in falsifiability, because it is a logical criterion. The empirical requirement on the potential falsifier, also called the \"material requirement\", is only that it is observable inter-subjectively with existing technologies. There is no requirement that the potential falsifier can actually show the law to be false. The purely logical contradiction, together with the material requirement, are sufficient. The logical part consists of theories, statements, and their purely logical relationship together with this material requirement, which is needed for a connection with the methodological part.\nThe methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which are used to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc. These include statistical tests: Popper is aware that observation statements are accepted with the help of statistical methods and that these involve methodological decisions. When this distinction is applied to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\". Popper said that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks instead of \"falsification\" and its problems.\nPopper said that methodological problems require proposing methodological rules. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then one has retired oneself from the game of science. The logical side does not have such methodological problems, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because basic statements are not required to be possible. Methodological rules are only needed in the context of actual falsifications.\nSo observations have two purposes in Popper's view. On the methodological side, observations can be used to show that a law is false, which Popper calls falsification. On the logical side, observations, which are purely logical constructions, do not show a law to be false, but contradict a law to show its falsifiability. Unlike falsifications and \"free from the problems of falsification\", these contradictions establish the value of the law, which may eventually be corroborated.\nPopper wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction between the logical aspect and the methodological aspect was not observed. This is still seen in a more recent literature. For example, in their 2019 article \"Evidence based medicine as science\", Vere and Gibson wrote \"[falsifiability has] been considered problematic because theories are not simply tested through falsification but in conjunction with auxiliary assumptions and background knowledge.\"\nBasic statements and the definition of falsifiability.\nBasic statements.\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be analyzed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations. The set of all purely logical observations that are considered constitutes the empirical basis. Popper calls them the \"basic statements\" or \"test statements\". They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper says that basic statements do not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that they are accepted by convention as belonging to the empirical language, a language that allows intersubjective verifiability: \"they must be testable by intersubjective observation (the material requirement)\". See the examples in section .\nIn more than twelve pages of \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\", Popper discusses informally which statements among those that are considered in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\nThe definition of falsifiability.\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\". He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary. The first decision described by Lakatos is implicit in this agreement, but the other decisions are not needed. This agreement, if one can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in detail and, as described in section , an actual agreement is needed. This may require using a deeper empirical basis, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ( gives some examples).\nPopper says that despite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which the whole logical process of science would not be possible.\nInitial condition and prediction in falsifiers of laws.\nIn his analysis of the scientific nature of universal laws, Popper arrived at the conclusion that laws must \"allow us to deduce, roughly speaking, more \"empirical\" singular statements than we can deduce from the initial conditions alone.\" A singular statement that has one part only cannot contradict a universal law. A falsifier of a law has always two parts: the initial condition and the singular statement that contradicts the prediction.\nHowever, there is no need to require that falsifiers have two parts in the definition itself. This removes the requirement that a falsifiable statement must make prediction. In this way, the definition is more general and allows the basic statements themselves to be falsifiable. Criteria that require that \"a law\" must be predictive, just as is required by falsifiability (when applied to laws), Popper wrote, \"have been put forward as criteria of the meaningfulness of sentences (rather than as criteria of demarcation applicable to theoretical systems) again and again after the publication of my book, even by critics who pooh-poohed my criterion of falsifiability.\"\nFalsifiability in model theory.\nScientists such as the Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon have studied the semantic aspects of the logical side of falsifiability. Here it is proposed that there are two formal requirements for a formally defined and stringent falsifiability that a scientific theory must satisfy to qualify as scientific: that they be \"finitely\" and \"irrevocably\" testable. These studies were done in the perspective that a logic is a relation between formal sentences in languages and a collection of mathematical structures, each of which is considered a model within model theory. The relation, usually denoted formula_13, says the formal sentence formula_14 is true when interpreted in the structure formula_15\u2014it provides the semantic of the languages. According to Rynasiewicz, in this semantic perspective, falsifiability as defined by Popper means that in some observation structure (in the collection) there exists a set of observations which refutes the theory. An even stronger notion of falsifiability was considered, which requires, not only that there exists one structure with a contradicting set of observations, but also that all structures in the collection that cannot be expanded to a structure that satisfies formula_14 contain such a contradicting set of observations.\nExamples of demarcation and applications.\nNewton's theory.\nIn response to Lakatos who suggested that Newton's theory was as hard to show falsifiable as Freud's psychoanalytic theory, Popper gave the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another. Popper thought that it was a basic statement that was a potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because the position of the apple at different times can be measured. Popper's claims on this point are controversial, since Newtonian physics does not deny that there could be forces acting on the apple that are stronger than Earth's gravity.\nEinstein's equivalence principle.\nAnother example of a basic statement is \"The inert mass of this object is ten times larger than its gravitational mass.\" This is a basic statement because the inert mass and the gravitational mass can both be measured separately, even though it never happens that they are different. It is, as described by Popper, a valid falsifier for Einstein's equivalence principle.\nEvolution.\nIndustrial melanism.\nIn a discussion of the theory of evolution, Popper mentioned industrial melanism as an example of a falsifiable law. A corresponding basic statement that acts as a potential falsifier is \"In this industrial area, the relative fitness of the white-bodied peppered moth is high.\" Here \"fitness\" means \"reproductive success over the next generation\". It is a basic statement, because it is possible to separately determine the kind of environment, industrial vs natural, and the relative fitness of the white-bodied form (relative to the black-bodied form) in an area, even though it never happens that the white-bodied form has a high relative fitness in an industrial area.\nPrecambrian rabbit.\nA famous example of a basic statement from J. B. S. Haldane is \"[These are] fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era.\" This is a basic statement because it is possible to find a fossil rabbit and to determine that the date of a fossil is in the Precambrian era, even though it never happens that the date of a rabbit fossil is in the Precambrian era. Despite opinions to the contrary, sometimes wrongly attributed to Popper, this shows the scientific character of paleontology or the history of the evolution of life on Earth, because it contradicts the hypothesis in paleontology that all mammals existed in a much more recent era. Richard Dawkins adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.\nSimple examples of unfalsifiable statements.\nA simple example of a non-basic statement is \"This angel does not have large wings.\" It is not a basic statement, because though the absence of large wings can be observed, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels. Even if it is accepted that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable.\nAnother example from Popper of a non-basic statement is \"This human action is altruistic.\" It is not a basic statement, because no accepted technology allows us to determine whether or not an action is motivated by self-interest. Because no basic statement falsifies it, the statement that \"All human actions are egotistic, motivated by self-interest\" is thus not falsifiable.\nOmphalos hypothesis.\nSome adherents of young-Earth creationism make an argument (called the Omphalos hypothesis after the Greek word for navel) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs. This ad hoc hypothesis introduced into young-Earth creationism is unfalsifiable because it says that the time of creation (of a species) measured by the accepted technology is illusory and no accepted technology is proposed to measure the claimed \"actual\" time of creation. Moreover, if the ad hoc hypothesis says that the world was created as we observe it today without stating further laws, by definition it cannot be contradicted by observations and thus is not falsifiable. This is discussed by Dienes in the case of a variation on the Omphalos hypothesis, which, in addition, specifies that God made the creation in this way to test our faith.\nUseful metaphysical statements.\n discussed statements such as \"All men are mortal.\" This is not falsifiable, because it does not matter how old a man is, maybe he will die next year. Maxwell said that this statement is nevertheless useful, because it is often corroborated. He coined the term \"corroboration without demarcation\". Popper's view is that it is indeed useful, because Popper considers that metaphysical statements can be useful, but also because it is indirectly corroborated by the corroboration of the falsifiable law \"All men die before the age of 150.\" For Popper, if no such falsifiable law exists, then the metaphysical law is less useful, because it is not indirectly corroborated. This kind of non-falsifiable statements in science was noticed by Carnap as early as 1937.\nMaxwell also used the example \"All solids have a melting point.\" This is not falsifiable, because maybe the melting point will be reached at a higher temperature. The law is falsifiable and more useful if we specify an upper bound on melting points or a way to calculate this upper bound.\nAnother example from Maxwell is \"All beta decays are accompanied with a neutrino emission from the same nucleus.\" This is also not falsifiable, because maybe the neutrino can be detected in a different manner. The law is falsifiable and much more useful from a scientific point of view, if the method to detect the neutrino is specified. Maxwell said that most scientific laws are metaphysical statements of this kind, which, Popper said, need to be made more precise before they can be indirectly corroborated. In other words, specific technologies must be provided to make the statements inter-subjectively-verifiable, i.e., so that scientists know what the falsification or its failure actually means.\nIn his critique of the falsifiability criterion, Maxwell considered the requirement for decisions in the falsification of, both, the emission of neutrinos (see ) and the existence of the melting point. For example, he pointed out that had no neutrino been detected, it could have been because some conservation law is false. Popper did not argue against the problems of falsification per se. He always acknowledged these problems. Popper's response was at the logical level. For example, he pointed out that, if a specific way is given to trap the neutrino, then, at the level of the language, the statement is falsifiable, because \"no neutrino was detected after using this specific way\" formally contradicts it (and it is inter-subjectively-verifiable\u2014people can repeat the experiment).\nNatural selection.\nIn the 5th and 6th editions of \"On the Origin of Species\", following a suggestion of Alfred Russel Wallace, Darwin used \"Survival of the fittest\", an expression first coined by Herbert Spencer, as a synonym for \"Natural Selection\". Popper and others said that, if one uses the most widely accepted definition of \"fitness\" in modern biology (see subsection ), namely reproductive success itself, the expression \"survival of the fittest\" is a tautology.\nDarwinist Ronald Fisher worked out mathematical theorems to help answer questions regarding natural selection. But, for Popper and others, there is no (falsifiable) law of Natural Selection in this, because these tools only apply to some rare traits. Instead, for Popper, the work of Fisher and others on Natural Selection is part of an important and successful metaphysical research program.\nMathematics.\nPopper said that not all unfalsifiable statements are useless in science. Mathematical statements are good examples. Like all formal sciences, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the empirical world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as quantity, structure, space and change. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable reality. Albert Einstein wrote, \"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.\"\nHistoricism.\nPopper made a clear distinction between the original theory of Marx and what came to be known as Marxism later on. For Popper, the original theory of Marx contained genuine scientific laws. Though they could not make preordained predictions, these laws constrained how changes can occur in society. One of them was that changes in society cannot \"be achieved by the use of legal or political means\". In Popper's view, this was both testable and subsequently falsified. \"Yet instead of accepting the refutations\", Popper wrote, \"the followers of Marx re-interpreted both the theory and the evidence in order to make them agree. ... They thus gave a 'conventionalist twist' to the theory; and by this stratagem, they destroyed its much advertised claim to scientific status.\" Popper's attacks were not directed toward Marxism, or Marx's theories, which were falsifiable, but toward Marxists who he considered to have ignored the falsifications which had happened. Popper more fundamentally criticized 'historicism' in the sense of any preordained prediction of history, given what he saw as our right, ability and responsibility to control our own destiny.\nUse in courts of law.\nFalsifiability has been used in the \"McLean v. Arkansas\" case (in 1982), the \"Daubert\" case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 found that \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert's underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"\n\"McLean v. Arkansas\" case.\nIn the ruling of the \"McLean v. Arkansas\" case, Judge William Overton used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"creation science\" was not scientific and should not be taught in Arkansas public schools as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher Michael Ruse defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see , and ):\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that: \nDaubert standard.\nIn several cases of the United States Supreme Court, the court described scientific methodology using the five Daubert factors, which include falsifiability. The Daubert result cited Popper and other philosophers of science: \nDavid H. Kaye said that references to the Daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that \"inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations.\"\nConnections between statistical theories and falsifiability.\nConsidering the specific detection procedure that was used in the neutrino experiment, without mentioning its probabilistic aspect, Popper wrote \"it provided a test of the much more significant \"falsifiable\" theory that such emitted neutrinos could be trapped in a certain way\". In this manner, in his discussion of the neutrino experiment, Popper did not raise at all the probabilistic aspect of the experiment. Together with Maxwell, who raised the problems of falsification in the experiment, he was aware that some convention must be adopted to fix what it means to detect or not a neutrino in this probabilistic context. This is the third kind of decisions mentioned by Lakatos. For Popper and most philosophers, observations are theory impregnated. In this example, the theory that impregnates observations (and justifies that we conventionally accept the potential falsifier \"no neutrino was detected\") is statistical. In statistical language, the potential falsifier that can be statistically accepted (not rejected to say it more correctly) is typically the null hypothesis, as understood even in popular accounts on falsifiability.\nDifferent ways are used by statisticians to draw conclusions about hypotheses on the basis of available evidence. Fisher, Neyman and Pearson proposed approaches that require no prior probabilities on the hypotheses that are being studied. In contrast, Bayesian inference emphasizes the importance of prior probabilities. But, as far as falsification as a yes/no procedure in Popper's methodology is concerned, any approach that provides a way to accept or not a potential falsifier can be used, including approaches that use Bayes' theorem and estimations of prior probabilities that are made using critical discussions and reasonable assumptions taken from the background knowledge. There is no general rule that considers as falsified an hypothesis with small Bayesian revised probability, because as pointed out by Mayo and argued before by Popper, the individual outcomes described in detail will easily have very small probabilities under available evidence without being genuine anomalies. Nevertheless, Mayo adds, \"they can indirectly falsify hypotheses by adding a methodological falsification rule\". In general, Bayesian statistic can play a role in critical rationalism in the context of inductive logic, which is said to be inductive because implications are generalized to conditional probabilities. According to Popper and other philosophers such as Colin Howson, Hume's argument precludes inductive logic, but only when the logic makes no use \"of additional assumptions: in particular, about what is to be assigned positive prior probability\". Inductive logic itself is not precluded, especially not when it is a deductively valid application of Bayes' theorem that is used to evaluate the probabilities of the hypotheses using the observed data and what is assumed about the priors. Gelman and Shalizi mentioned that Bayes' statisticians do not have to disagree with the non-inductivists.\nBecause statisticians often associate statistical inference with induction, Popper's philosophy is often said to have a hidden form of induction. For example, Mayo wrote \"The falsifying hypotheses\u00a0... necessitate an evidence-transcending (inductive) statistical inference. This is hugely problematic for Popper\". Yet, also according to Mayo, Popper [as a non-inductivist] acknowledged the useful role of statistical inference in the falsification problems: she mentioned that Popper wrote her (in the context of falsification based on evidence) \"I regret not studying statistics\" and that her thought was then \"not as much as I do\".\nLakatos's falsificationism.\nImre Lakatos divided the problems of falsification in two categories. The first category corresponds to decisions that must be agreed upon by scientists before they can falsify a theory. The other category emerges when one tries to use falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science. Lakatos described four kind of falsificationisms in view of how they address these problems. Dogmatic falsificationism ignores both types of problems. Methodological falsificationism addresses the first type of problems by accepting that decisions must be taken by scientists. Naive methodological falsificationism or naive falsificationism does not do anything to address the second type of problems. Lakatos used dogmatic and naive falsificationism to explain how Popper's philosophy changed over time and viewed sophisticated falsificationism as his own improvement on Popper's philosophy, but also said that Popper some times appears as a sophisticated falsificationist. Popper responded that Lakatos misrepresented his intellectual history with these terminological distinctions.\nDogmatic falsificationism.\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory-impregnated. Being theory-impregnated means that it goes beyond direct experience. For example, the statement \"Here is a glass of water\" goes beyond experience, because the concepts of glass and water \"denote physical bodies which exhibit a certain law-like behaviour\" (Popper). This leads to the critique that it is unclear which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation? This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. An example is Galileo's refutation of the theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. Another example is the theory that neutrinos are emitted in beta decays. Had they not been observed in the Cowan\u2013Reines neutrino experiment, many would have considered that the strength of the beta-inverse reaction used to detect the neutrinos was not sufficiently high. At the time, wrote, the possibility that this strength was sufficiently high was a \"pious hope\".\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses. The assumptions or auxiliary hypotheses of a particular test are all the hypotheses that are assumed to be accurate in order for the test to work as planned. The predicted observation that is contradicted depends on the theory and these auxiliary hypotheses. Again, this leads to the critique that it cannot be told if it is the theory or one of the required auxiliary hypotheses that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.\nLakatos says that Popper's solution to these criticisms requires that one relaxes the assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false: \nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies four kinds of decisions that have these respective goals: the selection of all \"basic statements\" (statements that correspond to logically possible observations), selection of the \"accepted basic statements\" among the basic statements, making statistical laws falsifiable and applying the refutation to the specific theory (instead of an auxiliary hypothesis). The experimental falsifiers and falsifications thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory.\nNaive falsificationism.\nAccording to Lakatos, naive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how scientific knowledge progresses. Very often a theory is still useful and used even after it is found in contradiction with some observations. Also, when scientists deal with two or more competing theories which are both corroborated, considering only falsifications, it is not clear why one theory is chosen above the other, even when one is corroborated more often than the other. In fact, a stronger version of the Quine-Duhem thesis says that it is not always possible to rationally pick one theory over the other using falsifications. Considering only falsifications, it is not clear why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's critical rationalism uses both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science. How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.\nPopper distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories and accepted basic statements emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated. The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations could be justified using some kind of formal logic. It is a delicate question, because this logic would be inductive: it justifies a universal law in view of instances. Also, falsifications, because they are based on methodological decisions, are useless in a strict justification perspective. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should. In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favour theories that are corroborated over those that are falsified, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of verisimilitude, a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to describe a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science. Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.\nFrom the problem of induction to falsificationism.\nHume explained induction with a theory of the mind that was in part inspired by Newton's theory of gravitation. Popper rejected Hume's explanation of induction and proposed his own mechanism: science progresses by trial and error within an evolutionary epistemology. Hume believed that his psychological induction process follows laws of nature, but, for him, this does not imply the existence of a method of justification based on logical rules. In fact, he argued that any induction mechanism, including the mechanism described by his theory, could not be justified logically. Similarly, Popper adopted an evolutionary epistemology, which implies that some laws explain progress in science, but yet insists that the process of trial and error is hardly rigorous and that there is always an element of irrationality in the creative process of science. The absence of a method of justification is a built-in aspect of Popper's trial and error explanation.\nAs rational as they can be, these explanations that refer to laws, but cannot be turned into methods of justification (and thus do not contradict Hume's argument or its premises), were not sufficient for some philosophers. In particular, Russell once expressed the view that if Hume's problem cannot be solved, \u201cthere is no intellectual difference between sanity and insanity\u201d and actually proposed a method of justification. He rejected Hume's premise that there is a need to justify any principle that is itself used to justify induction. It might seem that this premise is hard to reject, but to avoid circular reasoning we do reject it in the case of deductive logic. It makes sense to also reject this premise in the case of principles to justify induction. Lakatos's proposal of sophisticated falsificationism was very natural in that context.\nTherefore, Lakatos urged Popper to find an inductive principle behind the trial and error learning process and sophisticated falsificationism was his own approach to address this challenge. Kuhn, Feyerabend, Musgrave and others mentioned and Lakatos himself acknowledged that, as a method of justification, this attempt failed, because there was no normative methodology to justify\u2014Lakatos's methodology was anarchy in disguise.\nFalsificationism in Popper's philosophy.\nPopper's philosophy is sometimes said to fail to recognize the Quine-Duhem thesis, which would make it a form of dogmatic falsificationism. For example, Watkins wrote \"apparently forgetting that he had once said 'Duhem is right [...]', Popper set out to devise potential falsifiers just for Newton's fundamental assumptions\". But, Popper's philosophy is not always qualified of falsificationism in the pejorative manner associated with dogmatic or naive falsificationism. The problems of falsification are acknowledged by the falsificationists. For example, Chalmers points out that falsificationists freely admit that observation is theory impregnated. Thornton, referring to Popper's methodology, says that the predictions inferred from conjectures are not directly compared with the facts simply because all observation-statements are theory-laden. For the critical rationalists, the problems of falsification are not an issue, because they do not try to make experimental falsifications logical or to logically justify them, nor to use them to logically explain progress in science. Instead, their faith rests on critical discussions around these experimental falsifications. Lakatos made a distinction between a \"falsification\" (with quotation marks) in Popper's philosophy and a falsification (without quotation marks) that can be used in a systematic methodology where rejections are justified. He knew that Popper's philosophy is not and has never been about this kind of justification, but he felt that it should have been. Sometimes, Popper and other falsificationists say that when a theory is falsified it is rejected, which appears as dogmatic falsificationism, but the general context is always critical rationalism in which all decisions are open to critical discussions and can be revised.\nControversies.\nMethodless creativity versus inductive methodology.\nAs described in section , Lakatos and Popper agreed that universal laws cannot be logically deduced (except from laws that say even more). But unlike Popper, Lakatos felt that if the explanation for new laws cannot be deductive, it must be inductive. He urged Popper explicitly to adopt some inductive principle and sets himself the task to find an inductive methodology. However, the methodology that he found did not offer any exact inductive rules. In a response to Kuhn, Feyerabend and Musgrave, Lakatos acknowledged that the methodology depends on the good judgment of the scientists. Feyerabend wrote in \"Against Method\" that Lakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes is epistemological anarchism in disguise and Musgrave made a similar comment. In more recent work, Feyerabend says that Lakatos uses rules, but whether or not to follow any of these rules is left to the judgment of the scientists. This is also discussed elsewhere.\nPopper also offered a methodology with rules, but these rules are also not-inductive rules, because they are not by themselves used to accept laws or establish their validity. They do that through the creativity or \"good judgment\" of the scientists only. For Popper, the required non deductive component of science never had to be an inductive methodology. He always viewed this component as a creative process beyond the explanatory reach of any rational methodology, but yet used to decide which theories should be studied and applied, find good problems and guess useful conjectures. Quoting Einstein to support his view, Popper said that this renders obsolete the need for an inductive methodology or logical path to the laws. For Popper, no inductive methodology was ever proposed to satisfactorily explain science.\nAhistorical versus historiographical.\nSection says that both Lakatos's and Popper's methodology are not inductive. Yet Lakatos's methodology extended importantly Popper's methodology: it added a historiographical component to it. This allowed Lakatos to find corroborations for his methodology in the history of science. The basic units in his methodology, which can be abandoned or pursued, are research programmes. Research programmes can be degenerative or progressive and only degenerative research programmes must be abandoned at some point. For Lakatos, this is mostly corroborated by facts in history.\nIn contradistinction, Popper did not propose his methodology as a tool to reconstruct the history of science. Yet, some times, he did refer to history to corroborate his methodology. For example, he remarked that theories that were considered great successes were also the most likely to be falsified. Zahar's view was that, with regard to corroborations found in the history of science, there was only a difference of emphasis between Popper and Lakatos.\nAs an anecdotal example, in one of his articles Lakatos challenged Popper to show that his theory was falsifiable: he asked \"Under what conditions would you give up your demarcation criterion?\". Popper replied \"I shall give up my theory if Professor Lakatos succeeds in showing that Newton's theory is no more falsifiable by 'observable states of affairs' than is Freud's.\" According to David Stove, Lakatos succeeded, since Lakatos showed there is no such thing as a \"non-Newtonian\" behaviour of an observable object. Stove argued that Popper's counterexamples to Lakatos were either instances of begging the question, such as Popper's example of missiles moving in a \"non-Newtonian track\", or consistent with Newtonian physics, such as objects not falling to the ground without \"obvious\" countervailing forces against Earth's gravity.\nNormal science versus revolutionary science.\nThomas Kuhn analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant. For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge, is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought, Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which represent some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It is only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section ). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory. Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\nUnfalsifiability versus falsity of astrology.\nPopper often uses astrology as an example of a pseudoscience. He says that it is not falsifiable because both the theory itself and its predictions are too imprecise. Kuhn, as a historian of science, remarked that many predictions made by astrologers in the past were quite precise and they were very often falsified. He also said that astrologers themselves acknowledged these falsifications.\nEpistemological anarchism vs the scientific method.\nPaul Feyerabend rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos's argument for \"ad hoc\" hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method. He said that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, epistemological anarchism or \"anything goes\" would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have, derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.\nSokal and Bricmont.\nIn their book \"Fashionable Nonsense\" (from 1997, published in the UK as \"Intellectual Impostures\") the physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont criticised falsifiability. They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism. Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's description of falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science."}

They effectively fought as mercenaries or private military companies, regardless of their own nationality. In German-speaking countries, the first so-called (\"free regiments\", \"Freie Regimenter\") were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades, and deserters. These sometimes exotically equipped units served as infantry and cavalry (or, more rarely, as artillery); sometimes in just company strength and sometimes in formations of up to several thousand strong. There were also various mixed formations or legions. The Prussian included infantry, j\u00e4ger, dragoons and hussars. The French \"Volontaires de Saxe\" combined uhlans and dragoons.\nIn the aftermath of World War I and during the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, , consisting partially of World War I veterans, were raised as paramilitary militias. They were ostensibly mustered to fight on behalf of the government against the German communists attempting to overthrow the Weimar Republic. However, many also largely despised the Republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters, later aiding the Nazis in their rise to power.\nOrigins.\nThe first appeared during the War of the Austrian Succession and especially during the Seven Years' War, when France, Prussia, and the Habsburg monarchy embarked on an escalation of petty warfare while conserving their regular regiments. Even during the last Kabinettskrieg, the War of the Bavarian Succession, formations were formed in 1778. Germans, Hungarians, Poles, Lithuanians, and South Slavs, as well as Turks, Tatars and Cossacks, were believed by all warring parties to be inherently good fighters. The nationality of many soldiers can no longer be ascertained as the ethnic origin was often described imprecisely in the regimental lists. Slavs (Croats, Serbs) were often referred to as \"Hungarians\" or just \"Croats\", and Muslim recruits (Albanians, Bosnians, Tatars) as \"Turks\".\nInspired by the Slavic troops in Austrian service, France, the Dutch Republic and other nations began employing \"Free Troops\", usually consisting of infantry and cavalry units. The Dutch Republic employed a number of \"Vrij compagnie\u00ebn\"(Free Companies), raised between 1745 and 1747 and made up of volunteers and French deserters, such as the Walloon Grenadier Company. Although mostly used for reconnaissance and harassing enemy columns, the companies were organised into a battalion and engaged at the engagement at Wouw and the Battle of Lauffelt. Some companies were accompanied by a company of Dragons or Hussars, such as Roodt's Company and Cornab\u00e9's Legion. And in late 1747, a French company of Miners was captured and taken into service of the Republic. \nFrance also made extensive use of Free Companies and Legions. At the Battle of Fontenoy, deployment of the British attack column was hampered by the French 'Harquebusiers de Grassins'. After the Battle of Lauffelt, French light troops pursued the retreating allies, but were engaged in a bloody guerilla war with Austrian and Dutch light troops and Free Companies for the remainder of the campaign. \nFor Prussia, the Pandurs, who were made up of Croats and Serbs, were a clear model for the organization of such \"free\" troops. On 15 July 1759, Frederick the Great ordered the creation of a squadron of volunteer hussars to be attached to the 1st Hussar Regiment (von Kleist's Own). He entrusted the creation and command of this new unit to Colonel Friedrich Wilhelm von Kleist. This first squadron (80 men) was raised in Dresden and consisted mainly of Hungarian deserters. This squadron was placed under the command of Lieutenant Johann Michael von Kovacs. At the end of 1759, the first four squadrons of dragoons (also called horse grenadiers) of the were organised. They initially consisted of Prussian volunteers from Berlin, Magdeburg, Mecklenburg and Leipzig, but later recruited deserters. The were regarded as unreliable by regular armies, so they were used mainly as sentries and for minor duties. During the war, 14 \"free infantry\" () units were created, mainly between 1756 and 1758, which were intended to be attractive to those soldiers who wanted military \"adventure\", but did not want to have to do military drill. A distinction should be made between the formed up to 1759 for the final years of the war, which operated independently and disrupted the enemy with surprise attacks, and the free infantry which consisted of various military branches (such as infantry, hussars, dragoons, \"j\u00e4ger\") and were used in combination. They were often used to ward off Maria Theresa's Pandurs. In the era of linear tactics, light troops had been seen necessary for outpost, reinforcement and reconnaissance duties. During the war, eight such volunteer corps were set up:\nBecause, some exceptions, they were seen as undisciplined and less battleworthy, they were used for less onerous guard and garrison duties. In the so-called \"petty wars\", the interdicted enemy supply lines with guerrilla warfare. In the case of capture, their members were at risk of being executed as irregular fighters. In Prussia the , which Frederick the Great had despised as \"vermin\", were disbanded. Their soldiers were given no entitlement to pensions or invalidity payments.\nIn France, many corps continued to exist until 1776. They were attached to regular dragoon regiments as \"j\u00e4ger\" squadrons. During the Napoleonic Wars, Austria recruited various of Slavic origin. The Slavonic Wurmser fought in Alsace. The combat effectiveness of the six Viennese (37,000 infantrymen and cavalrymen), however, was low. An exception were the border regiments of Croats and Serbs who served permanently on the Austro-Ottoman border.\nNapoleonic era.\nDuring Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia, the hussar Denis Davydov, a warrior-poet, formed volunteer partisan detachments functioning as \"Freikorps\" during the French retreat from Moscow. These irregular units operated in conjunction with Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov's regular Russian Imperial Army and Ataman Matvei Platov's Cossack detachments, harassing the French supply lines and inflicting defeats on the retreating Grande Arm\u00e9e in the battles of Krasnoi and the Berezina.\n in the modern sense emerged in Germany during the course of the Napoleonic Wars. They fought not so much for money but for patriotic reasons, seeking to shake off the French Confederation of the Rhine. After the French under Emperor Napoleon had either conquered the German states or forced them to collaborate, remnants of the defeated armies continued to fight on in this fashion. Famous formations included the King's German Legion, who had fought for Britain in French-occupied Spain and mainly were recruited from Hanoverians, the L\u00fctzow Free Corps and the Black Brunswickers.\nThe attracted many nationally disposed citizens and students. commanders such as Ferdinand von Schill, Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von L\u00fctzow or Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, known as the \"Black Duke\", led their own attacks on Napoleonic occupation forces in Germany. Those led by Schill were decimated in the Battle of Stralsund (1809); many were killed in battle or executed at Napoleon's command in the aftermath. The were very popular during the period of the German War of Liberation (1813\u201315), during which von L\u00fctzow, a survivor of Schill's , formed his L\u00fctzow Free Corps. The anti-Napoleonic Freikorps frequently conducted operations behind French lines, functioning as a form of commando or guerrilla force.\nThroughout the 19th century, these anti-Napoleonic were greatly praised and glorified by German nationalists, and a heroic myth built up around their exploits. This myth was invoked, in considerably different circumstances, in the aftermath of Germany's defeat in World War I, then misused by the The Third Reich.\nFrance later raised its own free corps. On 5 January 1814, at the start of the invasion of France, Napoleon decreed the formation of \"corps francs\" for territorial defense in the border departments. They were dissolved by an ordinance of Louis XVIII on 15 April 1814. The \"corps francs\" were restored on 22 April 1815, following Napoleon's return to power, and participated in the defense of France during the Hundred Days. They were again dissolved by Louis XVIII on 20 July 1815.\nFreikorps poetry.\nThe anti-Napoleonic guerrilla movements in Germany, Russia and Spain in the early 1810s also produced their own style of poetry, \"hussar poetry\" or \"Freikorps poetry\", written by soldier-poets. In Germany, Theodor K\u00f6rner, Max von Schenkendorff and Ernst Moritz Arndt were the most famous soldier-poets from the Freikorps. Their lyrics were for the most part patriotic, republican, anti-monarchical and anti-French. In Russia, the leader of the guerrilla army, Davydov, invented the genre of hussar poetry, characterised by hedonism and bravado. He used events from his own life to illustrate such poetry. Later, when Mikhail Lermontov was a \"junker\" (cadet) in the Russian Imperial Army, he also wrote such poetry.\n1815\u201371.\nEven in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era, were set up with varying degrees of success. During the March 1848 riots, student were set up in Munich.\nIn First Schleswig War of 1848 the of \"von der Tann\", \"Zastrow\" and others distinguished themselves.\nIn 1864 in Mexico, the French formed the so-called \"Contreguerrillas\" under former Prussian hussar officer, Milson. In Italy, Giuseppe Garibaldi formed his famous \"Freischars\", notably the \"Thousand of Marsala\", which landed in Sicily in 1860.\nEven before the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71, were developed in France that were known as franc-tireurs.\nPost\u2013World War I.\nAfter World War I, the meaning of the word Freikorps changed compared to its past iterations. After 1918, the term referred to various\u2014yet, still, loosely affiliated\u2014paramilitary organizations that were established in Germany following the defeat in World War I. Of the numerous Weimar paramilitary groups active during that time, the Freikorps were, and remain, the most notable. While numbers are difficult to determine, historians agree that some 500,000 men were formal Freikorps members with another 1.5 million men participating informally.\nAmongst the social, political, and economic upheavals that marked the early years of the Weimar Republic, the tenuous German government under Friedrich Ebert, leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (, SPD), used the Freikorps to quell socialist and communist uprisings. Minister of Defence and SPD member Gustav Noske also relied on the Freikorps to suppress the Marxist Spartacist uprising, culminating in the summary executions of revolutionary communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg on 15 January 1919.\nFreikorps involvement in Germany and Eastern Europe.\nBavarian Soviet Republic.\nThe Bavarian Soviet Republic was a short-lived and unrecognized socialist-communist state from 12 April \u2013 3 May 1919 in Bavaria during the German Revolution of 1918\u201319. Following a series of political revolts and takeovers from German socialists and then Russian-backed Bolsheviks, Noske responded from Berlin by sending various Freikorps brigades to Bavaria in late April totalling some 30,000 men. The brigades included Hermann Ehrhardt's second Marine Brigade Freikorps, the Gorlitz Freikorps under Lieutenant Colonel Faupel, and two Swabian divisions from W\u00fcrttemberg under General Haas and Major Hirl as well as the largest Freikorps in Bavaria commanded by Colonel Franz Ritter von Epp.\nWhile they were met with little Communist resistance, the Freikorps acted with particular brutality and violence under Noske's blessing and at the behest of Major Schulz, adjutant of the L\u00fctzow Freikorps, who reminded his men that it \"[was] a lot better to kill a few innocent people than to let one guilty person escape\" and that there was no place in his ranks for those whose conscience bothered them. On 5 May 1919, Lieutenant Georg P\u00f6lzing, one of Schulz's officers, travelled to the town of Perlach outside of Munich. There, P\u00f6lzing chose a dozen alleged communist workers\u2014none of whom were actually communists, but members of the Social Democratic Party\u2014and shot them on the spot. The following day, a Freikorps patrol led by Captain Alt-Sutterheim interrupted the meeting of a local Catholic club, the St Joseph Society, and chose twenty of the thirty members present to be shot, beaten, and bayoneted to death. A memorial on Pfanzeltplatz in Munich commemorates the incident. Historian Nigel Jones notes that as a result of the Freikorps' violence, Munich's undertakers were overwhelmed, resulting in bodies lying in the streets and decaying until mass graves were completed.\nEastern Europe.\nThe Freikorps also fought against communists and Bolsheviks in Eastern Europe, most notably East Prussia, Latvia, Silesia, and Poland. The Freikorps demonstrated fervent anti-Slavic racism and viewed Slavs and Bolsheviks as \"sub-human\" hordes of \"ravening wolves\". To justify their campaign in the East, the Freikorps launched a campaign of propaganda that falsely positioned themselves as protectors of Germany's territorial hegemony over Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia as a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and as defenders against Slavic and Bolshevik hordes that \"raped women and butchered children\" in their wake. Historian Nigel Jones highlights the Freikorps's \"usual excesses\" of violence and murder in Latvia which were all the more unrestrained since they were fighting in a foreign land versus their own country. Hundreds were murdered in the Freikorps' Eastern campaigns, such as the massacre of 500 Latvian civilians suspected of harbouring Bolshevik sympathies or the capture of Riga which saw the Freikorps slaughter some 3,000 people. Summary executions via firing squads were most common, but several Freikorps members recorded the brutal and deadly beatings of suspected communists and particularly communist women.\nFreikorps identity and ideals.\nFreikorps ranks were composed primarily of former World War I soldiers who, upon demobilization, were unable to reintegrate into civilian society having been brutalized by the violence of the war physically and mentally. Combined with the government's poor support of veterans, who were dismissed as hysterical when suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, many German veterans found comfort and a sense of belonging in the Freikorps. Jason Crouthamel notes how the Freikorps' military structure was a familiar continuation of the frontlines, emulating the \"Kampfgemeinschaft\" (battle community) and \"Kameradschaft\" (camaraderie), thus preserving \"the heroic spirit of comradeship in the trenches\". Others, angry at Germany's sudden, seemingly inexplicable defeat, joined the Freikorps to fight against communism and socialism in Germany or to exact some form of revenge on those they considered responsible. To a lesser extent, German youth who were not old enough to have served in World War I enlisted in the Freikorps in hopes of proving themselves as patriots and as men.\nRegardless of reasons for joining, modern German historians agree that men of the Freikorps consistently embodied post-Enlightenment masculine ideals that are characterized by \"physical, emotional, and moral 'hardness'\". Described as \"children of the trenches, spawned by war\" and its process of brutalization, historians argue that Freikorps men idealized a militarized masculinity of aggression, physical domination, the absence of emotion (hardness). They were to be as \"swift as greyhounds, tough as leather, [and] hard as Krupp steel\" so as to defend what remained of German conservatism in times of social chaos, confusion, and revolution that came to define the immediate interwar era. Although World War I ended in Germany's surrender, many men in the Freikorps nonetheless viewed themselves as soldiers still engaged in active warfare with enemies of the traditional German Empire such as communists and Bolsheviks, Jews, socialists, and pacifists. Prominent Freikorps member Ernst von Salomon described his troops as \"full of wild demand for revenge and action and adventure...a band of fighter...full of lust, exultant in anger.\"\nIn 1977, German sociologist Klaus Theweleit published \"Male Fantasies,\" in which he argues that men in the Freikorps radicalized Western and German norms of male self-control into a perpetual war against feminine-coded desires for domesticity, tenderness, and compassion amongst men. Historians Nigel Jones and Thomas K\u00fchne note that the Freikorps' displays of violence, terror, and male aggression and solidarity established the beginnings of the fascist New Man upon which the Nazis built.\nDemobilization.\nThe extent of the Freikorps' involvement and actions in Eastern Europe, where they demonstrated full autonomy and rejected orders from the Reichswehr and German government, left a negative impression with the state. By this time, the Freikorps had served Ebert's purpose of suppressing revolts and communist uprisings. After the failed Kapp-L\u00fctwitz Putsch in March 1920 that the Freikorps participated in, the Freikorps' autonomy and strength steadily declined as Hans von Seeckt, commander of the Reichswehr, removed all Freikorps members from the army and restricted the movements' access to future funding and equipment from the government. Von Seeckt was successful, and by 1921 only a small yet devoted core remained, effectively drawing an end to the Freikorps until their resurgence as far-right thugs and street brawlers for the Nazis beginning in 1923.\nAffiliation with the Nazi Party.\nThe rise of the Nazi Party led to a resurgence of Freikorps activity, as many members or ex-members were drawn to the party's marrying of military and political life and extreme nationalism by joining the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) and \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS). Unlike in the German Revolution of 1918\u201319 or their involvement in Eastern Europe, the Freikorps now had almost no military value and were instead utilized by the Nazis as thugs to engage in street brawls with communists and to break up anarchist, communist and socialist meetings alongside the SA to gain a political edge. Moreover, the Nazis elevated the Freikorps as a symbol of pure German nationalism, anti-communism, and militarized masculinity to co-opt the lingering social and political support of the movement.\nEventually, Adolf Hitler came to view the Freikorps as a nuisance and possible threat to his consolidation of power. During the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, an internal purge of Hitler's enemies within the Nazi Party, numerous Freikorps members and leaders were targeted for killing or arrest, including Freikorps commander Hermann Ehrhardt and SA leader Ernst R\u00f6hm. In Hitler's Reichstag speech following the purge, Hitler denounced the Freikorps as lawless \"moral degenerates...aimed at the destruction of all existing institutions\" and as \"pathological enemies of the state...[and] enemies of all authority,\" despite his previous public adoration of the movement.\nNazi legacy.\nNumerous future members and leaders of the Nazi Party served in the Freikorps. Martin Bormann, eventual head of the Nazi Party Chancellery and Private Secretary to Hitler, joined Gerhard Ro\u00dfbach's Freikorps in Mecklenburg as a section leader and quartermaster. Reich Farmers' Leader and Minister of Food and Agriculture Richard Walther Darr\u00e9 was part of the Berlin Freikorps. Reinhard Heydrich, future chief of the Reich Security Main Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD) and initiator of the Final Solution, was in Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker's Freikorps as a teenager. Leader of the SS Heinrich Himmler enlisted in the Freikorps and carried a flag in the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. Rudolf H\u00f6ss joined the East Prussian Volunteer Freikorps in 1919 and eventually became commander of the Auschwitz extermination camp. Ernst R\u00f6hm, eventual leader of the SA, supported various Bavarian Freikorps groups, funnelling them arms and cash. Although many high-ranking National Socialists were former Freikorps fighters, recent research shows that former Freikorps fighters were no more likely to be involved in National Socialist organisations than the average male population in Germany.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, there existed certain armed groups loyal to Germany that went under the name \"Freikorps\". These include:\nUse in other countries.\nFrance.\nIn France, a similar group (but unrelated to the Freikorps) were the \"Corps Franc\". Starting in October 1939, the French Army raised a number of Corps Franc units with the mission of carrying out ambush, raid, and harassing operations forward of the Maginot Line during the period known as the Phoney War (Dr\u00f4le de Guerre). They were tasked with attacking German troops guarding the Siegfried Line. Future Vichy collaborationist, Anti-Bolshevik and SS Major Joseph Darnand was one of the more famous participants in these commando actions.\nIn May 1940, the experience of the Phoney War-era Corps Franc was an influence in creating the Groupes Francs Motoris\u00e9 de Cavalerie (GFC) who played a storied role in the delaying operations and last stands of the Battle of France, notably in the defenses of the Seine and the Loire. Between April \u2013 September 1944, the Corps Franc de la Montagne Noire unit operated as part of the French Resistance.\nCorps Francs d'Afrique.\nOn 25 November 1942, in the immediate aftermath of the Allied Invasion of Vichy French North Africa the Corps Francs d'Afrique (CFA) (African Corps Franc) was raised in French Morocco within the Free French Forces by General Giraud. Giraud drew the members of the all-volunteer unit from residents of Northern Africa of diverse religious backgrounds (Christian, Jew, and Muslim) and gave them the title of \"V\u00e9lite\", a name inspired by the elite light infantry of Napoleon's Imperial Guard, who were named after the Roman Velites. Much of the Corps was drawn from Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie and Jos\u00e9 Aboulker's G\u00e9o Gras French Resistance Group which had been responsible for the Algiers Insurrection where the Resistance seized control of Algiers on the night of 8 November 1942 in coordination with the Allied landings happening that same night. In taking over Algiers, they managed to capture both Admiral Darlan and General Juin, which led to the Darlan Deal wherein Vichy French forces came over to the Allied side. Darlan was later assassinated by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, an early member of the Corps Francs d'Afrique. They functioned as the Free French equivalent to the British Commandos. The Corps also included many Spanish and International old combatants of the Spanish Republican Army, which had sought refuge in Northern Africa in 1939.\nThe Corps Francs d'Afrique, under command of Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert, went on to fight Rommel's Afrikakorps in Tunisia with the U.S. 5th Army. They fought alongside the British 139th Brigade at Kassarine and Sidi Nasr, where they famously conducted a heroic bayonet charge, facing two to one odds, against the Italian 34th Battalion of the 10th Bersaglieri near the mountain of Kef Zilia on the road to Bizerte, taking 380 prisoners, killing the Italian battalion commander, and capturing the plans for Operation Ausladung. They participated in the capture of Bizerte in May 1943.\nFor its actions, the Corps Franc d'Afrique was awarded the Croix de Guerre.\nThe CFA formally was dissolved on 9 July 1943, with its members and equipment forming the corps of the newly created African Commando Group (GCA) on 13 July 1943 in Dupleix, Algeria, today seen as a forebear to the postwar Parachutist Shock Battalions and the modern day 13th RDP. The GCA went on to fight at Pianosa, Elba, Salerno, Provence, Belfort, Giromagny, Alsace, Cernay, Guebwiller, Buhl, and the Invasion of Germany.\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"}

The Mexican revolution would continue until 1920, well after Madero and D\u00edaz's deaths, with hundreds of thousands dead.\nA member of one of Mexico's wealthiest families, Madero studied business at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris. An advocate for social justice and democracy, his 1908 book \"The Presidential Succession in 1910\" called Mexican voters to prevent the reelection of Porfirio D\u00edaz, whose regime had become increasingly authoritarian. Bankrolling the opposition Anti-Reelectionist Party, Madero's candidacy garnered widespread support in the country. He challenged D\u00edaz in the 1910 election, which resulted in his arrest. After D\u00edaz declared himself winner for an eighth term in a rigged election, Madero escaped from jail, fled to the United States, and called for the overthrow of his regime in the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed, sparking the Mexican Revolution.\nMadero's armed support was concentrated in northern Mexico and was aided by access to arms and finances in the United States. In Chihuahua, Madero recruited wealthy landowner Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez to his movement, appointing him provisional governor of the state. Gonz\u00e1lez then enlisted Pancho Villa and Pascual Orozco as revolutionary leaders. Madero crossed from Texas into Mexico and took command of a band of revolutionaries, but was defeated in the Battle of Casas Grandes by the Federal Army, which led him to abandon military command roles. Concerned the Battle of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez would cause casualties in the American city of El Paso and prompt foreign intervention, Madero ordered Villa and Orozco to retreat, but they disobeyed and captured Ju\u00e1rez. D\u00edaz resigned on 25 May 1911 after the signing of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and went into exile. Madero retained the Federal Army and dismissed the revolutionary fighters who had forced D\u00edaz's resignation.\nMadero was enormously popular among many sectors but did not immediately assume the presidency. An interim president was installed, and elections were scheduled. Madero was elected in a landslide and sworn into office on 6 November 1911. The Madero administration soon encountered opposition from conservatives and more radical revolutionaries. Hesitation to implement large-scale land reform efforts upset many of his followers, who viewed it as a promised demand from conflict participation. Workers also became disillusioned by his moderate policies. Former supporter Emiliano Zapata declared himself in rebellion against Madero in the Plan of Ayala, and in the north, Pascual Orozco led an insurrection against him. Foreign investors became concerned that Madero could not maintain political stability, while foreign governments were concerned that a destabilized Mexico would threaten international order.\nIn February 1913, a coup d'\u00e9tat backed by the United States and led by conservative generals F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (a nephew of Porfirio D\u00edaz), Bernardo Reyes, and Victoriano Huerta was staged in Mexico City, with the latter taking the presidency. Madero was captured and assassinated along with vice president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez in a series of events now called the Ten Tragic Days, where his brother Gustavo was tortured and killed. After his assassination, Madero became a unifying force among revolutionary factions against the Huerta regime. In the north, Venustiano Carranza, then governor of Coahuila, led the nascent Constitutionalist Army; meanwhile, Zapata continued his rebellion against the federal government under the Plan of Ayala. Once Huerta was ousted in July 1914, the revolutionary coalitions met in the Convention of Aguascalientes, where disagreements persisted, and Mexico entered a new stage of civil war.\nEarly years (1873\u20131903).\nFamily background.\nFrancisco Ignacio Madero Gonz\u00e1lez was born in 1873 into a large and extremely wealthy family in northeastern Mexico at the hacienda of El Rosario, in Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila. His grandfather had built an enormous and diversified fortune as a young man and briefly served as Governor of Coahuila, from 1880 to 1884, during the four-year interregnum of Porfirio D\u00edaz's rule (1880\u20131884), when D\u00edaz's right-hand man General Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez served as president, doing a poor job in D\u00edaz's opinion. D\u00edaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and did not relinquish the office until 1911, when Francisco Madero's revolutionary movement forced him to resign. D\u00edaz had permanently sidelined Evaristo Madero from further political office. He was of Portuguese-Jewish descent\nEvaristo was the founder of a commercial transport business. Taking advantage of economic opportunity, he transported cotton from the Confederate states to Mexican ports during the U.S. Civil War (1861\u201365).\nEvaristo married twice, with the first marriage before he made his fortune to sixteen-year-old Mar\u00eda Rafaela Hern\u00e1dez Lombara\u00f1a (1847\u20131870), the daughter of an influential landowner, together producing seven children. She was the half-sister of the powerful miner and banker , a close friend of Jos\u00e9 Yves Limantour, Secretary of Finance. Alongside his brother-in-law and others of his new political family's relations, Evaristo founded the \"Compa\u00f1\u00eda Industrial de Parras\", initially involved in commercial vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, guayule rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. After Rafaela Hern\u00e1ndez's death at age 38, Evaristo married Manuela Far\u00edas y Benavides (1870\u20131893), producing eleven children. She was a member of one of northern Mexico's most influential families, daughter of , founder of the Rio Grande Republic. The surviving children of Evaristo's marriages also married into prominent families and expanded the Madero family's power and wealth.\nFor many years despite their exclusion from political office, the family prospered during Porfirio D\u00edaz's regime, and by 1910 the family was one of the richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15\u00a0million U.S. dollars of the day, and almost $500 million U.S. dollars in today's money). Much of this wealth arose from the diversification of Madero lands during the 1890s into the production of \"guayule\" rubber plants.\nUnusually for a Mexican landowner, many of whom stayed close to home, the patriarch Evaristo traveled to Europe, as did Francisco's father. Francisco's father was interested in the increasingly popular philosophical movement of spiritism, founded by Allan Kardec, and subscribed to the \"\" and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Parisienne d'\u00c9tudes Spirites, whilst completing his studies at the \u00c9cole Commercial in Antwerp (Belgium). Back in Mexico, he hired Thomas Edison to electrify his hacienda and neighboring town of Parras. Young Francisco was sent to Paris to study business alongside his brother Gustavo and became a devotee of spiritism himself. He wrote extensively about spiritism in his diaries. \"He was searching for ethical connections between Spiritualism and the Christian Gospels. 'I have no doubts that the moral transformation I have experienced is due to my becoming a medium.'\"\nFrancisco I. Madero was the first-born son of Evaristo's first-born son of his first marriage, Francisco Ignacio Madero Hern\u00e1ndez and Mercedes Gonz\u00e1lez Trevi\u00f1o, and was Evaristo's first-born grandson. Young Francisco was the first of his father's eleven children. This wealthy and prolific extended family could provide vast resources to young Francisco when he challenged Porfirio D\u00edaz for the presidency in 1910. He was a sickly child and was small in stature as an adult. It is widely believed that Madero's middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ignacio. On the birth certificate, Ignacio was written with the archaic spelling of \"Ygnacio\".\nAfter winning election to the presidency in 1911, Francisco confirmed his uncle Ernesto Madero Far\u00edas, from his grandfather's second marriage, as his Minister of Finance (a post which he had since the previous presidency), which was used to accuse him of nepotism. Francisco was close to his brother Gustavo A. Madero as a trusted advisor when president. His brother Gustavo was murdered during the coup that overthrew Francisco from the presidency. His brothers Emilio, Julio, and Ra\u00fal fought in the Mexican Revolution.\nAlthough Francisco I. Madero's marriage to Sara P\u00e9rez was childless and there are no direct descendants of his line of the Maderos, the descendants of Evaristo Madero make up some of Mexico's most influential families today. Thus, young Francisco was a member of an extended and powerful northern Mexican clan with a focus on commercial rather than political interests.\nEducation.\nFrancisco and his younger brother Gustavo A. Madero attended the Jesuit college of San Juan in Saltillo and wanted to then become a Jesuit. He and his brother Gustavo briefly attended another religious school in the U.S. His English was poor, so he learned little in his short time there, and he abandoned any notion of a religious vocation.\nBetween 1886 and 1892, Madero was educated in France and then the United States, attending the Lyc\u00e9e Hoche de Versailles, HEC Paris and UC Berkeley. At the Lyc\u00e9e Hoche in Versailles, France, he completed the classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles program. Soon after, he was admitted to study business at the prestigious \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris (HEC). His father's subscription to the magazine \"Revue Spirite\" awakened in the young Madero an interest in Spiritism, an offshoot of Spiritualism. During his time in Paris, Madero made a pilgrimage to the tomb of Allan Kardec, the founder of Spiritism, and became a passionate advocate of the belief, soon coming to believe he was a medium. Following business school, Madero studied at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue courses in agricultural techniques and to improve his English. During his time there, he was influenced by the theosophist ideas of Annie Besant, which were prominent at nearby Stanford University.\nReturn to Mexico.\nIn 1893, the 20-year-old Madero returned to Mexico and assumed management of one of the Madero family's hacienda at San Pedro, Coahuila. Well-traveled and well-educated, he was now in robust health. Proving an enlightened and progressive member of the Madero commercial complex, Francisco installed new irrigation, introduced American-made cotton and cotton machinery, and built a soap factory and also an ice factory. He embarked on a lifelong commitment to philanthropy. His employees were well paid and received regular medical exams; he built schools, hospitals, and community kitchens; and he paid to support orphans and award scholarships. He also taught himself homeopathy and offered medical treatments to his employees. Francisco became increasingly engaged with Spiritism and in 1901 was convinced that the spirit of his brother Ra\u00fal, who had died at age 4, was communicating with him, urging him to do charity work and practice self-discipline and self-abnegation. Madero became a vegetarian and stopped drinking alcohol and smoking.\nAlready well-connected to a wealthy family and now well-educated in business, he had built a personal fortune of over 500,000 pesos by 1899. He invested in mines with other members of his family, which came to compete with interests of the Guggenheim family in Mexico. The family was organized on patriarchal principles, so that even though young Francisco was wealthy in his own right, his father and especially his grandfather Evaristo viewed him as someone who should be under the authority of his elders. As the eldest sibling, Francisco exercised authority over his younger brothers and sisters. In January 1903, he married Sara P\u00e9rez Romero, first in a civil ceremony, and then a Catholic nuptial mass celebrated by the archbishop.\nPolitical career.\nIntroduction to politics (1903\u20131908).\nOn 2 April 1903, Bernardo Reyes, governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, violently crushed a political demonstration, an example of the increasingly authoritarian policies of president Porfirio D\u00edaz. Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the spirit of his late brother Ra\u00fal, he decided to act. The spirit of Ra\u00fal told him, \"Aspire to do good for your fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism.\" Madero founded the Benito Ju\u00e1rez Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of Arjuna (a prince from the \"Mahabharata\").\nIn 1905, Madero became increasingly involved in opposition to the D\u00edaz government, which had excluded his family from political power. He organized political clubs and founded a political newspaper (\"El Dem\u00f3crata\") and a satirical periodical (\"El Mosco\", \"The Fly\"). Madero's preferred candidate, Frumencio Fuentes, was defeated by that of Porfirio D\u00edaz in Coahuila's 1905 gubernatorial elections. D\u00edaz considered jailing Madero, but Bernardo Reyes suggested that Francisco's father be asked to control his increasingly political son.\nLeader of the Anti-Re-election Movement (1908\u20131909).\nIn an interview with journalist James Creelman published on 17 February 1908 issue of \"Pearson's Magazine\", President D\u00edaz said that Mexico was ready for a democracy and that the 1910 presidential election would be a free election.\nMadero spent the bulk of 1908 writing a book, which he believed was at the direction of spirits, now including that of Benito Ju\u00e1rez himself. This book, published in January 1909, was titled \"La sucesi\u00f3n presidencial en 1910\" (\"The Presidential Succession of 1910\"). The book quickly became a bestseller in Mexico. The book proclaimed that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one man \u2013 Porfirio D\u00edaz \u2013 for so long had made Mexico sick. Madero pointed out the irony that in 1871, Porfirio D\u00edaz's political slogan had been \"No Re-election\". Madero acknowledged that Porfirio D\u00edaz had brought peace and a measure of economic growth to Mexico. However, Madero argued that this was counterbalanced by the dramatic loss of freedom, including the brutal treatment of the Yaqui people, the repression of workers in Cananea, excessive concessions to the United States, and an unhealthy centralization of politics around the person of the president. Madero called for a return of the Liberal 1857 Constitution. To achieve this, Madero proposed organizing a Democratic Party under the slogan \"Sufragio efectivo, no reelecci\u00f3n\" (\"Effective Suffrage. No Re-election\"). Porfirio D\u00edaz could either run in a free election or retire.\nMadero's book was well received, and widely read. Many people began to call Madero \"the Apostle of Democracy\". Madero sold off much of his property \u2013 often at a considerable loss \u2013 to finance anti-re-election activities throughout Mexico. He founded the Anti-Re-election Center in Mexico City in May 1909, and soon thereafter lent his backing to the periodical \"El Antirreeleccionista\", which was run by the young lawyer/philosopher Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos and another intellectual, Luis Cabrera Lobato. In Puebla, Aquiles Serd\u00e1n, from a politically engaged family, contacted Madero and as a result, formed an Anti-Re-electionist Club to organize for the 1910 elections, particularly among the working classes. Madero traveled throughout Mexico giving anti-reelectionist speeches, and everywhere he went he was greeted by crowds of thousands. His candidacy cost him financially, since he sold much of his property at a loss to back his campaign.\nIn spite of the attacks by Madero and his earlier statements to the contrary, D\u00edaz ran for re-election. In a show of U.S. support, D\u00edaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico. At the meeting, Diaz told John Hays Hammond, \"Since I am responsible for bringing several billion dollars in foreign investments into my country, I think I should continue in my position until a competent successor is found.\" \nThe summit was a great success for D\u00edaz, but it could have been a major tragedy. On the day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol along the procession route and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of D\u00edaz and Taft.\nThe Porfirian regime reacted to Madero by placing pressure on the Madero family's banking interests, and at one point even issued a warrant for Madero's arrest on the grounds of \"unlawful transaction in rubber\". Madero was not arrested, though, apparently due in part to the intervention of D\u00edaz's finance minister, Jos\u00e9 Yves Limantour, a friend of the Madero family. In April 1910, the Anti-Re-electionist Party met and selected Madero as their nominee for President of Mexico.\nDuring the convention, the governor of Veracruz arranged a meeting between Madero and D\u00edaz, Teodoro Dehesa, and took place in D\u00edaz's residence on 16 April 1910. Only the candidate and the president were present for the meeting, so the only account of it is Madero's correspondence. A political solution and compromise might have been possible, with Madero withdrawing his candidacy. It became clear to Madero that D\u00edaz was a decrepit old man, out of touch politically, and unaware of the extent of formal political opposition. The meeting was important for strengthening Madero's resolve that political compromise was not possible and he is quoted as saying \"Porfirio is not an imposing chief. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to start a revolution to overthrow him. But who will crush it afterwards?\" Madero was worried that Porfirio D\u00edaz would not willingly relinquish office, warned his supporters of the possibility of electoral fraud and proclaimed that \"Force shall be met by force!\"\nCampaign, arrest, escape 1910.\nMadero campaigned across the country on a message of reform and met with numerous supporters. Resentful of the \"peaceful invasion\" from the United States \"which came to control 90 percent of Mexico's mineral resources, its national railroad, its oil industry and, increasingly, its land,\" Mexico's poor and middle-class overwhelmingly showed their support for Madero. Fearful of a dramatic change in direction, on 6 June 1910, the Porfirian regime arrested Madero in Monterrey and sent him to a prison in San Luis Potos\u00ed. Approximately 5,000 other members of the Anti-Re-electionist movement were also jailed. Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez took over the nomination, but during Madero's time in jail, a fraudulent election was held on 21 June 1910 that gave D\u00edaz an unbelievably large margin of victory.\nMadero's father used his influence with the state governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 4 October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. Three days later he was smuggled across the U.S. border, hidden in a baggage car by sympathetic railway workers. He took up residence in San Antonio, Texas, where he plotted his next moves. He wrote the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed in San Antonio, but back dated and situated in to last place he had been in Mexico.\nPlan of San Luis Potos\u00ed and rebellion.\nMadero set up shop in San Antonio, Texas, and quickly issued his Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed, which had been written during his time in prison, partly with the help of Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Velarde. The plan proclaimed the elections of 1910 null and void, and called for an armed revolution to begin at 6\u00a0pm on 20 November 1910, against the \"illegitimate presidency/dictatorship of D\u00edaz\". At that point, Madero declared himself provisional President of Mexico, and called for a general refusal to acknowledge the central government, restitution of land to villages and Indian communities, and freedom for political prisoners. Madero's policies painted him as a leader of each of the different sectors of Mexican society at the time. He was a member of the upper class; the middle class saw that he sought to gain entry into political processes; the lower class saw that he promised fairer politics and a much more substantial, equitable economic system.\nThe family drew on its financial resources to make regime change possible, with Madero's brother Gustavo A. Madero hiring the law firm of Washington lawyer Sherburne Hopkins, the \"world's best rigger of Latin American revolutions\" to foment support in the U.S. A strategy to discredit D\u00edaz with U.S. business and the U.S. government did meet some success, with Standard Oil engaging in talks with Gustavo Madero, but more importantly, the U.S. government \"bent neutrality laws for the revolutionaries.\" The U.S. Senate held hearings in 1913 as to whether the U.S. had any role in fomenting revolution in Mexico, Hopkins gave testimony that \"he did not believe that it cost the Maderos themselves more than $400,000 gold\", with the aggregate cost being $1,500,000US.\nMadero supposedly initiated the Mexican Revolution with guidance from spirits (Madero identified as a medium who communicated with ghosts, including historical figures like Benito Juarez and even his deceased younger brother.) \nEl Paso, Texas, became a major staging point for Madero's insurrection against D\u00edaz. It is directly across the Rio Grande from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, where two railway Mexican lines, the Mexican National Railroad and the Mexican Northwest Railroad, are connected with the U.S. Southern Pacific Railroad. El Paso was the site of a historic meeting between Mexican President Porfirio D\u00edaz and U.S. President William Howard Taft in 1909. The population of the twin border cities increased dramatically in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with legal commerce and considerable smuggling, \"a time-honored occupation along the border.\" As the political tensions in Mexico increased, the smuggling of guns and ammunition to insurrectionists was big business. Madero remained in San Antonio, Texas, but his main man in Chihuahua, Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez had recruited gifted, natural military leaders, Pancho Villa and Pascual Orozco, to Madero's cause. Chihuahua became the hub of insurrectionist activity. Villa and Orozco had increasing success against the Federal Army, which drew more recruits to Madero's cause since it seemed to have a real chance at success. , a follower of Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n, who forbade members of the Magonista movement to have anything to do with the Madero movement, but the pragmatist Villareal joined Madero.\nOn 20 November 1910, Madero arrived at the border and planned to meet up with 400 men raised by his uncle Catarino Benavides Hern\u00e1ndez to launch an attack on Ciudad Porfirio D\u00edaz (modern-day Piedras Negras, Coahuila). However, his uncle arrived late and brought only ten men. Madero decided to postpone the revolution. Instead, he and his brother Ra\u00fal (who had been given the same name as his late brother) traveled incognito to New Orleans, Louisiana.\nOn 14 February 1911, Madero crossed the border into Chihuahua state from Texas, and on 6 March 1911 led 130 men in an attack on Casas Grandes, Chihuahua. Although holding democratic ideals that attracted many to his movement, Madero learned he was not a military leader. \"Madero didn't know the first thing about warfare,\" initially capturing the town from the Federal Army, but he did not realize he needed to scout whether Federal reinforcements were on the way. There were heavy casualties among the insurrectionists, a number of whom were foreigners, including many from the U.S. and some from Germany. Two survivors of the Casas Grandes debacle were Giuseppe Garibaldi II, grandson of the famous Italian revolutionary, and General Benjamin Johannes Viljoen, an Afrikaner veteran of the Boer War. Madero was slightly wounded in his right arm in the fighting, shown bandaged in a photograph. Madero was saved by his personal bodyguard and Revolutionary general M\u00e1ximo Castillo. He remained head of the movement in the north to oust D\u00edaz. Madero movement successfully imported arms from the United States, procured by agents in the United States. Some were shipped directly from New York, disguised so that they would not be intercepted by the U.S. government. There were two businesses in El Paso that sold arms and ammunition to the rebels. The U.S. government of President William Howard Taft hired agents to surveil insurrectionists, fairly openly operated in El Paso. But the U.S. government efforts to halt the flow of arms to the Mexican revolutionaries failed.\nBy April the Revolution had spread to eighteen states, including Morelos where the leader was Emiliano Zapata. On 1 April 1911, Porfirio D\u00edaz claimed that he had heard the voice of the people of Mexico, replaced his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President D\u00edaz and Vice-president Ram\u00f3n Corral. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders\u00a0\u2013 they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with D\u00edaz if possible.\nIn early May, Madero wanted to extend a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa disagreed and went ahead without orders on 8 May to attack Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. It surrendered after two days of bloody fighting. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively, making it clear that D\u00edaz could no longer retain power.\nOn 21 May 1911, the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez was signed. Under the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, D\u00edaz and Corral agreed to resign by the end of May 1911, with D\u00edaz's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra, becoming interim president solely for the purpose of calling general elections. Madero did not want to come to power by force of arms, but by a democratic election.\nThis first phase of the Mexican Revolution thus ended with D\u00edaz leaving for exile in Europe at the end of May 1911. He was escorted to the port of Veracruz by General Victoriano Huerta. On 7 June 1911, Madero entered Mexico City in triumph where he was greeted with huge crowds shouting \"\u00a1Viva Madero!\"\nMadero was arriving not as the conquering hero, but as a presidential candidate who now embarked on campaigning for the fall presidential election. He left in place all but the top political figures of the D\u00edaz regime as well as the Federal Army, which had just been defeated by revolutionary forces. The Governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza, and Luis Cabrera had strongly advised Madero not to sign the treaty, since it gave away the power the revolutionary forces had won. For Madero, that was not the only consideration. Madero saw that revolutionaries like Orozco were not going to docilely obey his orders not to attack and the situation could get even more out of hand when D\u00edaz resigned. Madero recognized the legitimacy of the Federal Army and called on revolutionary forces to disband. \"Having removed D\u00edaz, it appeared that Madero was trying to contain the Revolutionary tiger before it had time to enjoy its liberty.\"\nInterim presidency of De la Barra (May\u2013November 1911).\nAlthough Madero and his supporters had forced Porfirio D\u00edaz from power, he did not assume the presidency in June 1911. Instead, following the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, he was a candidate for president and had no formal role in the interim presidency of Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra, a diplomat and lawyer. Left in place was the Congress of Mexico, which was full of candidates whom D\u00edaz had handpicked for the 1910 election. By doing this, Madero was true to his ideological commitment to constitutional democracy, but with members of the D\u00edaz regime still in power, he was caused difficulties in the short and long term. The German ambassador to Mexico, Paul von Hintze, who associated with the Interim President, said of him that \"De la Barra wants to accommodate himself with dignity to the inevitable advance of the ex-revolutionary influence, while accelerating the widespread collapse of the Madero party...\" Madero sought to be a moderate democrat and follow the course outlined in treaty bringing about exile of D\u00edaz, but by calling for the disarming and demobilization of his revolutionary base, he undermined his support. The Mexican Federal Army, just defeated by the revolutionaries, was to continue as the armed force of the Mexican state. Madero argued that the revolutionaries should henceforth proceed solely by peaceful means. In the south, revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata was skeptical about disbanding his troops, especially since the Federal Army from the D\u00edaz era remained essentially intact. However, Madero traveled south to meet with Zapata at Cuernavaca and Cuautla, Morelos. Madero assured Zapata that the land redistribution promised in the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed would be carried out when Madero became president.\nWith Madero now campaigning for the presidency, which he was expected to win, several landowners from Zapata's state of Morelos took advantage of his not being head of state and appealed to President De la Barra and the Congress to restore their lands which had been seized by Zapatista revolutionaries. They spread exaggerated stories of atrocities committed by Zapata's irregulars, calling Zapata the \"Attila of the South\". De la Barra and the Congress, therefore, decided to send regular troops under Victoriano Huerta to suppress Zapata's revolutionaries. Madero once again traveled south to urge Zapata to disband his supporters peacefully, but Zapata refused on the grounds that Huerta's troops were advancing on Yautepec. Zapata's suspicions proved accurate as Huerta's Federal soldiers moved violently into Yautepec. Madero wrote to De la Barra, saying that Huerta's actions were unjustified and recommending that Zapata's demands be met. However, when he left the south, he had achieved nothing. Nevertheless, he promised the Zapatistas that once he became president, things would change. Most Zapatistas had grown suspicious of Madero, however.\nPresidency and assassination (November 1911 \u2013 February 1913).\nMadero became president in November 1911, and, intending to reconcile the nation, appointed a cabinet that included many of Porfirio D\u00edaz's supporters, as well as Madero's uncle Ernesto Madero, as Minister of Finance. A curious fact is that almost immediately after taking office in November, Madero became the first head of state in the world to fly in an airplane, which the Mexican press was later to mock. Madero was unable to achieve the reconciliation he desired since conservative Porfirians had organized themselves during the interim presidency and now mounted a sustained and effective opposition to Madero's reform program. Conservatives in the Senate refused to pass the reforms he advocated. At the same time, several of Madero's allies denounced him for being overly conciliatory with the Porfirians and with not moving aggressively forward with reforms.\nAfter years of censorship, Mexican newspapers took advantage of their newly found freedom of the press to harshly criticize Madero's performance as president. Gustavo A. Madero, the president's brother, remarked that \"the newspapers bite the hand that took off their muzzle.\" President Madero refused the recommendation of some of his advisors that he bring back censorship. The press was particularly critical of Madero's handling of rebellions that broke out against his rule shortly after he became president.\nDespite internal and external opposition, the Madero administration had a number of important accomplishments, including freedom of the press. He freed political prisoners and abolished the death penalty. He did away with the practice of the D\u00edaz government, which appointed local political bosses (\"jefes pol\u00edticos\"), and instead set up a system of independent municipal authorities. State elections were free and fair. He was concerned about the improvement of education, establishing new schools and workshops. An important step was the creation of a federal department of labor, limited the workday to 10 hours, and set in place regulations on women's and children's labor. Unions were granted the right to freely organize. The \"Casa del Obrero Mundial\" (\"House of the World Worker\"), an organization with anarcho-syndicalist was founded during his presidency.\nMadero alienated a number of his political supporters when he created a new political party, the Constitutionalist Progressive party, which replaced the Anti-Reelectionist Party. He ousted leftist Emilio V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez from his cabinet, brother of Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez, whom Madero had replaced as his vice presidential candidate with Pino Su\u00e1rez.\nMadero made gestures of reform to those who had helped bring him to power, but his aim was a democratic transition to power, fulfilled by his election. His supporters were offered mild gestures of reform, creating a Department of Labor and a National Agrarian Commission, but organized labor and peasants seeking land did not have their fundamental situations changed.\nRebellions.\nMadero retained the Mexican Federal Army and ordered the demobilization of revolutionary forces. For revolutionaries who considered themselves the reason that D\u00edaz resigned, this was a hard course to follow. Since Madero did not implement immediate, radical reforms that many of those had supported him had expected, he lost control of those areas in Morelos and Chihuahua. A series of internal rebellions challenged Madero's presidency before the February 1913 coup that deposed him.\nZapatista rebellion.\nIn Morelos, Emiliano Zapata proclaimed the Plan of Ayala on 25 November 1911, which excoriated Madero's slowness on land reform and declared the signatories in rebellion. Zapata's plan recognized Pascual Orozco as fellow revolutionary, although Orozco was for the moment loyal to Madero, until 1912. Madero sent the Federal Army to suppress the rebellion, but failed to do so. For Madero's opponents this was evidence of his ineffectiveness as a leader.\nReyes rebellion.\nIn December 1911, General Bernardo Reyes, whom Porfirio D\u00edaz had sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission because D\u00edaz worried that Reyes was going to challenge him for the presidency, launched a rebellion in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, where he had previously served as governor. He called for \"the people\" to rise against Madero. \"His rebellion was a total failure\", lasting only eleven days before Reyes surrendered to the Federal Army at Linares, Nuevo Le\u00f3n. When the rebellion broke out, Madero made a calculated decision to entrust Pascual Orozco to put it down. In the fight against D\u012faz, Orozco had led revolutionary forces in the north capturing Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, against Madero's orders. Madero had not treated him well after he was elected, but entrusted him over General Victoriano Huerta. Huerta had previously been a supporter of Reyes, and Madero was concerned that Huerta would join with Reyes rather than suppress the rebellion. In one historian's assessment, \"President Madero played his political cards perfectly this occasion. Had he dispatched a large force to the north under the command of either Huerta of [General] Blanquet, it is quite possible that a major military defection, seriously threatening the government.\" Reyes was sent to the Santiago Tlatelolco military prison in Mexico City. Madero allowed Reyes privileges while in prison, which allowed him to organize subsequent conspiracies from jail.\nV\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez rebellion.\nNearly simultaneous with Reyes's rebellion, , rose in rebellion. Emilio was the brother of Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez whom Madero replaced as the vice presidential candidate Pino Su\u00e1rez when he successfully ran for president. Emilio gathered supporters in Chihuahua, with a number of small rebellions against the Madero's regime breaking out in December 1911. Although Madero sent the Federal Army, he then sent Orozco to put down the rebellion. Rebels had captured and looted Ciudad Ju\u00e1r\u00e9z. Orozco arrived with a contingent of troops. Still popular in Chihuahua, Orozco persuaded rebels to lay down their arms against Madero. Madero was delighted that Orozco had been so successful in dealing with two rebellions.\nOrozco rebellion.\nThe two small, northern rebellions that Orozco suppressed showed his again his military skills, but with the V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez rebellion, he realized his continued popularity. In his recent dealings with Madero, the president had shown him respect, which was much lacking after Orozco disobeyed Madero's orders not to take Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in May 1911 when Madero was attempting non-military means to persuade D\u012faz to resign. Orozco was personally resentful of how President Madero had treated him once he was in office. He launched a rebellion in Chihuahua in March 1912 with the financial backing of Luis Terrazas, a former Governor of Chihuahua who was the largest landowner in Mexico. Northern oligarchs had opposed ousting of D\u00edaz and Madero's presidency and saw in Orozco a potential ally, a rival to oust Madero. They began flattering him that he was the man to bring order to Mexico. Madero's advisors had repeatedly warned Madero that Orozco was untrustworthy, but Madero had just seen the demonstration of Orozco's loyalty in preserving his presidency. Orozco's \"revolution came as a complete shock to Madero.\"\nAt his request, Madero dispatched troops under General Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Salas, the Secretary of War, to put down the rebellion. Gonz\u00e1lez Salas was not a seasoned campaign general, but he did not want Huerta to be dispatched. Unlike the two small, unsuccessful rebellions that attracted few followers, Orozco not only had an army to 8,000 men, he had backing from landowning interests, and a detailed battle plan to sweep through Chihuahua and capture Mexico City. Although Gonz\u00e1lez Salas commanded forces of 2,000 troops, he was an ineffective leader. In the first major encounter, Orozco triumphed, crushing the Federal Army. Gonz\u00e1lez Salas committed suicide after the military humiliation.General Victoriano Huerta assumed control of the federalist forces. Huerta was more successful, defeating Orozco's troops in three major battles and forcing Orozco to flee to the United States in September 1912.\nRelations between Huerta and Madero grew strained during the course of this campaign when Pancho Villa, the commander of the \"Divisi\u00f3n del Norte\", refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912. Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.\nF\u00e9lix D\u00edaz rebellion.\nOctober 1912, F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (nephew of Porfirio D\u00edaz) launched a rebellion in Veracruz, hoping to capitalize on his famous name and with support from the U.S. But even with U.S. support, D\u00edaz's rebellion collapsed after no Mexican generals or the general populace supported it. D\u00edaz was arrested and imprisoned. Although D\u00edaz was sentenced to death for his rebellion, the Supreme Court of Mexico, whose judges were appointed by former President D\u00edaz, declared that F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would be imprisoned, but not executed. Madero did not interfere with the decision; D\u00edaz was transferred to the same prison where Reyes was incarcerated, where the two plotted further conspiracies. \"Madero displayed a fatal softness toward the leaders of these coup attempts.\nU.S. and the Madero government.\nInitially, the U.S. was cautiously optimistic about Madero leading the new government. He had kept the Federal Army and the federal bureaucracy, and dismissed the revolutionary forces that brought him to power. Although his Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed signaled his openness to land reform, he failed to move on it, which did not have an impact on the U.S. or its business interests. Madero displayed no overt anti-Americanism, but his resistance to U.S. pressure on a variety of issues were taken as that by the U.S. government and business interests. He did not follow through on promises made in his name, perhaps by his brother Gustavo A. Madero, to turn Mexico's oil industry over to the Standard Oil Company. He refused to satisfy U.S. demands for compensation for life and property outside of a bilateral commission. He planned to institute universal male military service, which would have strengthened Mexico's position against foreign powers. Furthermore, Madero's lifting of restrictions on labor organizing had resulted in strikes, which had an impact on U.S. companies in Mexico. Likewise, Madero was not deviating from President D\u00edaz's firmness against demands that infringed on Mexican sovereignty and domestic policy, but the U.S. pressed the issues. \nThe United States' position towards the Madero regime grew increasingly hostile. The U.S. Ambassador, Henry Lane Wilson conducted a campaign of anti-Madero propaganda and disinformation, aimed at alarming the American residents, a campaign against Madero in U.S. newspapers. The U.S. government and business interests, too, increasingly backed rebellions against Madero.\nGermany and the Madero government.\nGermany had business interests in Mexico, in banking and in exports from Germany, but it was reluctant to challenge the U.S. as the premier foreign arbiter in Mexico. In the period before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, it followed the lead of the U.S. of initially being optimistic about Madero's moderation against revolutionary tendencies. But when U.S. turned against Madero, the U.S. ambassador and the German ambassador Paul von Hintze were in close contact. Hintze's reports on the situation in Mexico during the Madero presidency were a rich source of information about the regime. Although the U.S. attempted to draw Germany as well as Great Britain into intervention in Mexico, both held back. They also sought to prevent the U.S. from intervening itself. Hintze had a low opinion of F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz, and saw the head of the Mexican Federal Army, Victoriano Huerta, as an appropriate candidate as a military dictator. That view dictated his actions as a plan for a coup was hatched in early 1913.\nSuccessful coup against Madero.\nIn early 1913, General F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (Porfirio D\u00edaz's nephew) and General Bernardo Reyes plotted the overthrow of Madero. Now known in Mexican history as the Ten Tragic Days, from 9 to 19 February events in the capital led to the overthrow and murder of Madero and his vice president. Rebel forces bombarded the National Palace and downtown Mexico City from the military arsenal (\"ciudadela\"). Madero's loyalists initially held their ground, but Madero's commander, General Victoriano Huerta secretly switched sides to support the rebels. Madero's decision to appoint Huerta as commander of forces in Mexico City was one \"for which he would pay for with his life.\" Madero and his vice president were arrested. Under pressure Madero resigned the presidency, with the expectation that he would go into exile, as had President D\u00edaz in May 1911. Madero's brother and advisor Gustavo A. Madero was kidnapped off the street, tortured, and killed. Following Huerta's coup d'\u00e9tat on 18 February 1913, Madero was forced to resign. After a 45-minute term of office, Pedro Lascur\u00e1in was replaced by Huerta, who took over the presidency later that day.Following his forced resignation, Madero and his Vice-president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez were kept under guard in the National Palace. On the evening of 22 February, they were told that they were to be transferred to the main city penitentiary, where they would be safer. At 11:15\u00a0pm, reporters waiting outside the National Palace saw two cars containing Madero and Su\u00e1rez emerge from the main gate under a heavy escort commanded by Major Francisco C\u00e1rdenas, an officer of the rurales. The journalists on foot were outdistanced by the motor vehicles, which were driven towards the penitentiary. The correspondent for the \"New York World\" was approaching the prison when he heard a volley of shots. Behind the building, he found the two cars with the bodies of Madero and Su\u00e1rez nearby, surrounded by soldiers and gendarmes. Major C\u00e1rdenas subsequently told reporters that the cars and their escort had been fired on by a group, as they neared the penitentiary. The two prisoners had leapt from the vehicles and ran towards their presumed rescuers. They had however been killed in the cross-fire the night of 22 February. This account was treated with general disbelief, although the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, a strong supporter of Huerta, reported to Washington that, \"I am disposed to accept the (Huerta) government's version of the affair and consider it a closed incident\".\nPresident Madero, dead at 39, was buried quietly in the French cemetery of Mexico City. A series of contemporary photographs taken by Manuel Ramos show Maderos's coffin being carried from the penitentiary and placed on a special funeral tram car for transportation to the cemetery. Only his close family were permitted to attend, leaving for Cuba immediately after. Following Huerta's overthrow, Francisco C\u00e1rdenas fled to Guatemala where he committed suicide in 1920 after the new Mexican government had requested his extradition to stand trial for the murder of Madero.\nAftermath of coup.\nThere was shock at Madero's murder, but there were many, including Mexican elites and foreign entrepreneurs and governments, who saw the coup and the emergence of General Huerta as the desired strongman to return order to Mexico. Among elites in Mexico, Madero's death was a cause of rejoicing, seeing the time since D\u00edaz's resignation as one of political instability and economic uncertainty. Ordinary Mexicans in the capital, however, were dismayed by the coup, since many considered Madero a friend, but their feelings did not translate into concrete action against the Huerta regime. In northern Mexico, Madero's overthrow and martyrdom united forces against Huerta's usurpation of power. Governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza refused to support the new regime although most state governors had. He brought together a coalition of revolutionaries under the banner of the Mexican Constitution, so that the Constitutionalist Army fought for the principles of constitutional democracy that Madero embraced. In southern Mexico, Zapata had been in rebellion against the Madero government for its slow action on land reform and continued in rebellion against the Huerta regime. However, Zapata repudiated his former high opinion of fellow revolutionary Pascual Orozco, who had also rebelled against Madero, when Orozco allied with Huerta. Madero's anti-reelectionist movement had mobilized revolutionary action that led to the resignation of D\u00edaz. Madero's overthrow and murder during the Ten Tragic Days was a prelude to further years of civil war.\nFor Mexicans hopeful of positive change with the Madero presidency, his performance in office was not inspiring, but as a martyr to the revolution ousted and murdered by reactionary forces with the aid of the United States ambassador, he became a powerful unifying force. The Governor of Coahuila, Madero's home state, became the leader of the northern revolutionaries opposing the Huerta. Venustiano Carranza had been put in office by Madero. Carranza named the broad-based, anti-Huerta northern coalition the Constitutionalist Army, invoking the Mexican Constitution of 1857 and rule of law that they hoped to restore. In 1915, a Constitutionalist supporter created a chart outlining the political leaders of the time, calling Madero \"The Great Democrat, elected president by the unanimous will of the people.\" But by 1917, when the Constitutionalists had emerged as the winning faction of the revolution, Carranza began reshaping the historical narrative of the revolution that excluded Madero entirely. For Carranza, the revolution had three periods, with the start date being the armed struggle against Huerta, led by himself. After three years as constitutional president, Carranza himself was ousted and killed in a 1920 coup by Sonoran revolutionary generals, \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n, Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, and Adolfo de la Huerta. Madero's status as a hero of the revolution was restored by the Sonoran dynasty, which deliberately constructed a narrative of historical memory that endures. 20 November, the day that Madero set in the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed for the rebellion against Porfirio D\u00edaz, became a national day of celebration.\nHistorical memory and popular culture.\nMadero was known as \"The Apostle of Democracy,\" but \"Madero the martyr meant more to the soul of Mexico.\"\nDespite Madero's importance as a historical figure, there are relatively few memorials or monuments to him. It was not until the Monument to the Revolution was completed in 1938 that Madero had a public resting place. He had been interred in the French cemetery in Mexico City after his death. His tomb had been an informal pilgrimage site on the anniversary of his murder (22 February) and the proclamation of his Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed (20 November), which launched the Mexican Revolution. Initially, the monument to the Revolution held the remains of Madero, Carranza, and Villa and was planned as a collective commemoration of the Revolution, not individual revolutionaries. Although it was completed on 20 November 1938, there was no inaugural ceremony.\nThe date of Madero's Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed, 20 November, was a fixed official holiday in Mexico, Revolution Day, but a 2005 change in the law makes the third Monday in November the day of commemoration. During the presidency of Venustiano Carranza, he ignored 20 November and commemorated 26 March, the anniversary of his Plan de Guadalupe.\nThe Mexico City Metro has a stop named for Madero's vice president, Metro Pino Su\u00e1rez, but not one to Madero. General Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n laid a foundation stone on the 10th anniversary of Madero's death of a planned Madero statue in the z\u00f3calo, but the statue was never built. A statue was erected in 1956 at a downtown intersection in Mexico City and has been moved to the presidential residence, Los Pinos, not easily viewable by the public. An exception is Avenida Madero in Mexico City. One contemporaneous honor by General Pancho Villa remains in Mexico City. On the morning of 8 December 1914, he declared that the street leading from the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City towards the Paseo de la Reforma would be named for Madero. Still officially called Francisco I. Madero Avenue, but commonly known simply as Madero street, it is one of the most popular and historically significant streets in the city. It was pedestrianised in 2009.\nMexican artist Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada created an etching for a broadside, produced on the occasion of Madero's election in 1910, titled \"Calavera de Madero\" portraying Madero as a calavera.\nMadero appears in the films \"Viva Villa!\" (1934), \"Villa Rides\" (1968) and \"Viva Zapata!\" (1952).\nIn the novel \"The Friends of Pancho Villa\" (1996) by James Carlos Blake, Madero is a major character.\nAlong with Hermila Galindo and Carmen Serd\u00e1n, Madero appears on the obverse of the 1000 Mexican peso banknote issued from 2020.\nMadero and his family described in a very positive light in \"All the Pretty Horses\" in a prize winning novel by Cormac McCarthy."}
{"id": "11286", "revid": "40437653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11286", "title": "Fruitarianism", "text": "Fruitarianism () is a diet that consists primarily of consuming fruits and possibly nuts and seeds, but without any animal products. Fruitarian diets are subject to criticism and health concerns.\nFruitarianism may be adopted for different reasons, including ethical, religious, environmental, cultural, economic, and presumed health benefits. A fruitarian diet may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as reduced intake of vitamin B12, calcium, iron, zinc, omega-3 or protein.\nVarieties.\nSome fruitarians will eat only what falls (or would fall) naturally from a plant; that is, plant foods that can be harvested without killing or harming the plant. These foods consist primarily of culinary fruits, nuts, and seeds. Some do not eat grains, believing it is unnatural to do so, and some fruitarians feel that it is improper for humans to eat seeds as they contain future plants, or nuts and seeds, or any food besides juicy fruit. Others believe they should eat only plants that spread seeds when the plant is eaten. Others eat seeds and some cooked foods. Some fruitarians use the botanical definitions of fruits and consume pulses, such as beans, peas, or other legumes. Other fruitarians' diets include raw fruits, dried fruits, nuts, honey and olive oil, nuts, beans or chocolate.\nA related diet is nutarianism, for individuals who only eat nuts.\nIdeology and diet.\nSome fruitarians, like Jains, wish to avoid killing anything, including plants, and refer to ahimsa fruitarianism. For some fruitarians, the motivation comes from a fixation on a utopian past, their hope being to return to a past that pre-dates an agrarian society to when humans were simply gatherers. Another common motivation is the desire to eliminate perceived toxicity from within the body. For others, the appeal of a fruitarian diet comes from the challenge that the restrictive nature of this diet provides.\nNutrition.\nAccording to nutritionists, adults must be careful not to follow a fruit-only diet for too long. A fruitarian diet is wholly unsuitable for children (including teens), nursing mothers and their babies. Death can result from malnutrition.\nNutritional effects.\nFruitarianism is more restrictive than veganism or raw veganism, as a subset of both. Maintaining this diet over a long period can result in dangerous deficiencies, a risk that many fruitarians try to ward off through nutritional testing and vitamin injections. The Health Promotion Program at Columbia University reports that a fruitarian diet can cause deficiencies in calcium, protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, most B vitamins (especially B12), and essential fatty acids.\nAlthough fruit provides a source of carbohydrates, they have very little protein, and because protein cannot be stored in the body as fat and carbohydrates can, fruitarians need to be careful that they consume enough protein each day. When the body does not absorb enough protein, it leads to a deficiency of amino acids, which are essential to creating body proteins which support the growth and maintenance of body tissues. Consuming high amounts of fruit also poses a risk to those who are diabetic or pre-diabetic, due to the negative effect that the large amounts of sugar in fruits has on blood sugar levels. These high levels of sugar mean that fruitarians are at a higher risk for tooth decay. Another concern that fruitarianism presents is that because fruit is easily digested, the body burns through meals quickly, and is hungry again soon after eating. A side effect of the digestibility is that the body will defecate more frequently.\nAdditionally, the Health Promotion Program at Columbia reports that food restrictions in general may lead to hunger, cravings, food obsessions, social disruptions, and social isolation. The severe dietary restrictions inherent in a fruitarian regime also carries the serious risk of triggering orthorexia nervosa.\nHarriet Hall has written that a fruitarian diet \"leads to nutritional deficiencies, especially in children. Fruitarians can develop protein energy malnutrition, anemia, and low levels of iron, calcium, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\"\nVitamin B12.\nVitamin B12, a bacterial product, cannot be obtained from fruits. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, \"natural food sources of vitamin B12 are limited to foods that come from animals.\" Like raw vegans who do not consume B12-fortified foods (for example, certain plant milks and some breakfast cereals), fruitarians may need to include a B12 supplement in their diet or risk vitamin B12 deficiency.\nGrowth and development concerns.\nIn children, growth and development may be at risk. Some nutritionists state that children should not follow a fruitarian diet. Nutritional problems include severe protein\u2013energy malnutrition, anemia and deficiencies including protein, iron, calcium, essential fatty acids, raw fibre and a wide range of vitamins and minerals.\nNotable adherents.\nSome notable advocates of fruitarianism, or of diets which may be considered fruitarian, or of lifestyles including such a diet, are:\nIn popular culture.\nThe minor character Keziah in the 1999 film \"Notting Hill\" (played by Emma Bernard) tells William \"Will\" Thacker (Hugh Grant) that she is a fruitarian. She says she believes that \"fruits and vegetables have feeling,\" meaning she opposes cooking them, only eating things that have \"actually fallen off a tree or bush\" and that are dead already, leading to what some describe as a negative depiction.\nBoth fruitarians and nutarians are mentioned in \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce. Dick Gregory also promoted the former in his book, \"Cooking with Mother Nature\"."}

No country has recognised the new Taliban-run government, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Although some countries have engaged in informal diplomatic contact with the Islamic Emirate, formal relations remain limited to representatives of the Islamic Republic.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century, Afghanistan had to contend with aggression on multiple sides, as it became part of the Great Game confrontation between Britain and Russia.\nContemporary era.\nBefore the Soviet invasion, Afghanistan pursued a policy of neutrality and non-alignment in its foreign relations, being one of the few independent nations to stay neutral in both World War I and World War II. In international forums, Afghanistan generally followed the voting patterns of Asian and African non-aligned countries. During the 1950s and 1960s, Afghanistan was able to use the Soviet and American need for allies during the Cold War as a way to receive economic assistance from both countries. However, given that unlike the Soviet Union, the United States refused to give extensive military aid to the country, the government of Daoud Khan developed warmer ties with the USSR while officially remaining non-aligned. Following the coup of April 1978, the government under Nur Muhammad Taraki developed significantly closer ties with the Soviet Union and its communist satellites.\nAfter the December 1979 Soviet invasion, Afghanistan's foreign policy mirrored that of the Soviet Union. Afghan foreign policymakers attempted, with little success, to increase their regime's low standing in the non-communist world. With the signing of the Geneva Accords, President Najibullah unsuccessfully sought to end the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan's isolation within the Islamic world and in the Non-Aligned Movement.\nMost Western countries, including the United States, maintained small diplomatic missions in the Afghan capital Kabul during the Soviet occupation. Many countries subsequently closed their missions due to instability and heavy fighting in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.\nMany countries initially welcomed the introduction of the Taliban regime, who they saw as a stabilising, law-enforcing alternative to the warlords who had ruled the country since the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992. The Taliban soon alienated itself as knowledge of the harsh Sharia law being enforced in Taliban-controlled territories spread around the world. The brutality towards women who attempted to work, learn, or leave the house without a male escort caused outside aid to the war-torn country to be limited.\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan.\nFollowing the October 2001 American invasion and the Bonn Agreement the new government under the leadership of Hamid Karzai started to re-establish diplomatic relationships with many countries who had held close diplomatic relations before the communist coup d'\u00e9tat and the subsequent civil war.\nThe Afghan government was focused on securing continued assistance for rebuilding the economy, infrastructure, and military of the country. It continued to maintain close ties with North America, the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Australia, India, Pakistan, China, Russia and the Greater Middle East (most specifically Turkey), as well as African nations. It also sought to establish relations with more South American or Latin American nations.\nBefore the fall of Kabul in 2021, the foreign relations of Afghanistan were handled by the nation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was headed by Mohammad Hanif Atmar. He answered to, and received guidance from, the President of Afghanistan.\nIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban gradually gained control of the country in the summer of 2021 and proclaimed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan on August 15, 2021. The takeover culminated with the fall of Kabul. The Taliban has had some limited contact with foreign governments and will need to develop further relations with the international community as its new de facto government goes forward.\nOn 20 September 2021, the new government designated Mohammad Suhail Shaheen as a replacement for Ghulam M Isaczai, Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations who continues to represent the country at the UN. The UNGA's nine-member credentials committee will decide on this but no date has been set.\nSince the Taliban took over the Afghan government, countries including China, Russia, and the United States have contacted Taliban representatives, but have expressed doubts about its commitment to counterterrorism. Border clashes between the Taliban forces with Pakistan, Iran and Turkmenistan, and border closure and hostilities towards Tajikistan, have also caused friction with Afghanistan's neighbours.\nIn September 2023, China became the first country to formally name a new ambassador to the country since the takeover, even though China still doesn't formally recognize the Taliban.\nDiplomatic relations prior to 2021.\nList of countries which the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan maintained diplomatic relations with:\nUnited Nations.\nDuring the Soviet occupation in the 1980s, the United Nations was highly critical of the Soviet Union's interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and was instrumental in obtaining a negotiated Soviet withdrawal under the terms of the Geneva Accords.\nIn the aftermath of the Accords and subsequent Soviet withdrawal, the United Nations has assisted in the repatriation of refugees and has provided humanitarian aid such as health care, educational programs, and food and has supported mine-clearing operations. The UNDP and associated agencies have undertaken a limited number of development projects. However, the UN reduced its role in Afghanistan in 1992 in the wake of fierce factional strife in and around Kabul. The UN Secretary General has designated a personal representative to head the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA) and the Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), both based in Islamabad, Pakistan. Throughout the late 1990s, 2000, and 2001, the UN unsuccessfully strived to promote a peaceful settlement among the Afghan factions as well as provide humanitarian aid, this despite increasing Taliban restrictions upon UN personnel and agencies."}

The term \"felony\" originated from English common law (from the French medieval word \"f\u00e9lonie\") to describe an offense that resulted in the confiscation of a convicted person's land and goods, to which additional punishments, including capital punishment, could be added; other crimes were called misdemeanors. Following conviction of a felony in a court of law, a person may be described as a felon or a convicted felon.\nIn many common law jurisdictions, such as England and Wales, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, crimes are no longer classified as felonies or misdemeanors. Instead, crimes are classified by mode of trial as indictable offences, triable by jury, which are usually more serious, and summary offences, triable by summary procedure without a jury, which are usually less serious.\nIn some civil law jurisdictions, such as Italy and Spain, the term \"delict\" is used to describe serious offenses, a category similar to common law felony. In other nations, such as Germany, France, Belgium, and Switzerland, more serious offenses are described as 'crimes', while 'misdemeanors' or 'delicts' (or \"d\u00e9lits\") are less serious. In still others, such as Brazil and Portugal, 'crimes' and 'delicts' are synonymous (more serious) and are opposed to contraventions (less serious).\nIn the United States, where the felony\u2013misdemeanor distinction is still widely applied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor. The classification is based upon a crime's potential sentence, so a crime remains classified as a felony even if a defendant convicted of a felony receives a sentence of one year or less. Some individual states classify crimes by other factors, such as seriousness or context.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, a felony is a crime that is punishable by death or more than one year in prison. \nHistory.\nUnder common law, felonies were crimes punishable by either death, forfeiture of property, or both. While felony charges remain serious, concerns of proportionality (i.e., that the punishment fits the crime) have since prompted legislatures to require or permit the imposition of less serious punishments, ranging from lesser terms of imprisonment to the substitution of a jail sentence or even the suspension of all incarceration contingent upon a defendant's successful completion of probation. Standards for measurement of an offense's seriousness include attempts to quantitatively estimate and compare the effects of a crime upon its specific victims or society generally.\nThe reform of harsh felony laws that had originated in Great Britain was deemed \"one of the first fruits of liberty\" after the United States became independent.\nClassification by subject matter.\nFelonies may include but are not limited to the following:\nSome offenses, though similar in nature, may be felonies or misdemeanors depending on the circumstances. For example, the illegal manufacture, distribution or possession of controlled substances may be a felony, although possession of small amounts may be only a misdemeanor. Possession of a deadly weapon may be generally legal, but carrying the same weapon into a restricted area such as a school may be viewed as a serious offense, regardless of whether there is intent to use the weapon. Additionally, driving under the influence in some US states may be a misdemeanor if a first offense, but a felony on subsequent offenses.\nClassification by seriousness.\nIn much of the United States, all or most felonies are placed into one of various classes according to their seriousness and their potential punishment upon conviction. The number of classifications and the corresponding crimes vary by state and are determined by the legislature. Usually, the legislature also determines the maximum punishment allowable for each felony class; doing so avoids the necessity of defining specific sentences for every possible crime. For example:\nSome felonies are classified as forcible or violent, typically because they contain some element of force or a threat of force against a person and are subject to additional penalties. Burglary is also classified as a forcible felony in some jurisdictions including Illinois and Florida.\nConsequences.\nIn many parts of the United States, a felon can experience long-term legal consequences persisting after the end of their imprisonment. The status and designation as a \"felon\" is considered permanent and is not extinguished upon sentence completion even if parole, probation or early release was given. The status can be cleared only by a successful appeal or executive clemency. However, felons may qualify for restoration of some rights after a certain period of time has passed.\nThe consequences felons experience in most states include:\nAdditionally, many job applications and rental applications ask about felony history (a practice forbidden in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), and answering dishonestly can be grounds for rejection of the application or termination of employment if the lie is discovered after hire. Convicted felons may not be eligible for certain professional licenses or bonds, while hiring them may raise the cost of an employer's insurance. \nIt is broadly legal to discriminate against felons in hiring and leasing decisions (although a blanket ban on renting to felons may violate federal housing law), so felons can face barriers to finding both jobs and housing. Moreover, a common term of parole agreements is to avoid association with other felons. In some neighborhoods with high rates of felony conviction, this creates a situation in which many felons live under a constant threat of being arrested for violating parole. Banks may refuse to issue loans to felons, and a felony conviction may prevent employment in banking or finance.\nIn some states, restoration of those rights depends on repayment of various fees associated with the felon's arrest, processing, and prison stay, such as restitution to victims, or outstanding fines.\nRestoration of rights.\nThe primary means of restoring civil rights that are lost as a result of a felony conviction are executive clemency and expungement.\nFor state law convictions, expungement is determined by the law of the state. Many states do not allow expungement, regardless of the offense, though felons can seek pardons and clemency, potentially including restoration of rights.\nFederal law does not have any provision for persons convicted of federal felonies in a federal United States district court to apply to have their record expunged. At present the only relief that an individual convicted of a felony in federal court may receive is a presidential pardon, which does not expunge the conviction, but rather grants relief from the civil disabilities that stem from it.\nOther jurisdictions.\nCameroon.\nIn the law of Cameroon, a felony is a crime for which the maximum sentence is more than 10 years, or death. Felonies are distinguished from misdemeanors (maximum sentence from 10 days to 10 years) and offenses (not exceeding 10 days). While lesser crimes are tried before a magistrate's court, felonies must be tried before a high court (\"tribunal de grande instance\").\nThe drafters of the bilingual Cameroonian penal code of 1967 based their work on French law and Nigerian law. In the case of felonies, they chose to set the threshold for felonies much higher than under either French law (five years) or Nigerian law (three years). This had the effect of greatly reducing the number of felonies under Cameroonian law. It also reduced the number of crimes that were subject to trial by jury in the courts of East Cameroon at that time.\nEngland and Wales.\nHistory.\nSir William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that felony \"comprises every species of crime, which occasioned at common law the forfeiture of lands or goods\". The word \"felony\" was feudal in origin, denoting the value of a man's entire property: \"the consideration for which a man gives up his fief\". Blackstone refutes the misconception that felony simply means an offense punishable by death, by demonstrating that not every felony is capital, and not every capital offense is a felony. However he concedes that \"the idea of felony is indeed so generally connected with that of capital punishment, that we find it hard to separate them; and to this usage the interpretations of the law do now conform.\"\nThe death penalty for felony could be avoided by pleading benefit of clergy, which gradually evolved to exempt everybody (whether clergy or not) from that punishment for a first offense, except for high treason and offenses expressly excluded by statute. During the 19th century criminal law reform incrementally reduced the number of capital offences (see Capital punishment in the United Kingdom), and forfeiture for felony was abolished by the Forfeiture Act 1870. Consequently, the distinction between felony and misdemeanor became increasingly arbitrary. The surviving differences consisted of different rules of evidence and procedure, and the Law Commission recommended that felonies be abolished altogether. This was done by the Criminal Law Act 1967, which set the criminal practice for all crimes as that of misdemeanor and introduced a new system of classifying crimes as either \"arrestable\" and \"non-arrestable\" offenses (according to which a general power of arrest was available for crimes punishable by five years' imprisonment or more).\nArrestable offenses were abolished in 2006, and today crimes are classified as indictable or summary offenses, the only distinction being the mode of trial (by jury in the Crown Court or summarily in a magistrates' court, respectively).\nProcedure.\nThe Trials for Felony Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4 c. 114) allowed persons indicted for felonies to be represented by counsel or attorney.\nTerminology.\nA person being prosecuted for this was called a prisoner, though increasingly \"accused\" or \"defendant\" was preferred.\nGermany.\nA felony (, a word also translated in less technical contexts as simply \"crime\") is defined in the (Criminal Code, StGB) as an unlawful act () that is punishable with a minimum of one year's imprisonment. A misdemeanor (\"Vergehen\") is any other crime punishable by imprisonment with a minimum of less than one year or by fine.\nHowever, in some cases a severe version of a misdemeanor may be punished with imprisonment of more than one year, yet the crime itself remains considered a misdemeanor. The same applies for a milder version of a felony that is punished with imprisonment less than a year.\nAn attempt to commit a felony is itself a crime, whereas an attempt to commit a misdemeanor is a crime only if specifically prescribed as such by law.\nIreland.\nIn Irish law the distinction between felony and misdemeanor was abolished by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, such that the law previously applied to misdemeanors was extended to all offenses. Minister Joan Burton, introducing the bill in the Seanad, said \"The distinction has been eroded over many years and in today's conditions has no real relevance. Today, for example, serious offenses such as fraudulent conversion and obtaining property by false pretenses are classified as misdemeanors whereas a relatively trivial offense such as stealing a bar of chocolate is a felony.\" The 1997 Act, modeled on the English Criminal Law Act 1967, introduced the category of \"arrestable offense\" for those with penalties of five years' imprisonment or greater.\nThe 1937 Constitution declares that the parliamentary privilege, which protects Oireachtas members from arrest traveling to or from the legislature, does not apply to \"treason, felony, and breach of the peace\". The 1996 Constitutional Review Group recommended replacing \"felony\" with \"serious criminal offence\"."}

{"id": "11296", "revid": "31737083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11296", "title": "First aid", "text": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person with a medical emergency, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery until medical services arrive. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical or first response training. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health, while psychological first aid is used as early treatment of people who are at risk for developing PTSD. Conflict first aid, focused on preservation and recovery of an individual's social or relationship well-being, is being piloted in Canada.\nThere are many situations that may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance, which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances. This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace (such as an automated external defibrillator), the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings, or mandatory first aid training within schools. Generally, five steps are associated with first aid:\nEarly history and warfare.\nSkills of what is now known as first aid have been recorded throughout history, especially in relation to warfare, where the care of both traumatic and medical cases is required in particularly large numbers. The bandaging of battle wounds is shown on Classical Greek pottery from , whilst the parable of the Good Samaritan includes references to binding or dressing wounds. There are numerous references to first aid performed within the Roman army, with a system of first aid supported by surgeons, field ambulances, and hospitals. Roman legions had the specific role of capsarii, who were responsible for first aid such as bandaging, and are the forerunners of the modern combat medic.\nFurther examples occur through history, still mostly related to battle, with examples such as the Knights Hospitaller in the 11th century AD, providing care to pilgrims and knights in the Holy Land.\nFormalization of life saving treatments.\nDuring the late 18th century, drowning as a cause of death was a major concern amongst the population. In 1767, a society for the preservation of life from accidents in water was started in Amsterdam, and in 1773, physician William Hawes began publicizing the power of artificial respiration as means of resuscitation of those who appeared drowned. This led to the formation, in 1774, of the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned, later the Royal Humane Society, who did much to promote resuscitation.\nNapoleon's surgeon, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, is credited with creating an ambulance corps, the \"ambulance volantes\", which included medical assistants, tasked to administer first aid in battle.\nIn 1859, Swiss businessman Jean-Henri Dunant witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino, and his work led to the formation of the Red Cross, with a key stated aim of \"aid to sick and wounded soldiers in the field\". The Red Cross and Red Crescent are still the largest provider of first aid worldwide.\nIn 1870, Prussian military surgeon Friedrich von Esmarch introduced formalized first aid to the military, and first coined the term \"erste hilfe\" (translating to 'first aid'), including training for soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War on care for wounded comrades using pre-learnt bandaging and splinting skills, and making use of the Esmarch bandage which he designed. The bandage was issued as standard to the Prussian combatants, and also included aide-memoire pictures showing common uses.\nIn 1872, the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in England changed its focus from hospice care, and set out to start a system of practical medical help, starting with making a grant towards the establishment of the UK's first ambulance service. This was followed by creating its own wheeled transport litter in 1875 (the St John Ambulance), and in 1877 established the St John Ambulance Association (the forerunner of modern-day St John Ambulance) \"to train men and women for the benefit of the sick and wounded\".\nAlso in the UK, Surgeon-Major Peter Shepherd had seen the advantages of von Esmarch's new teaching of first aid, and introduced an equivalent programme for the British Army, and so being the first user of \"first aid for the injured\" in English, disseminating information through a series of lectures. Following this, in 1878, Shepherd and Colonel Francis Duncan took advantage of the newly charitable focus of St John, and established the concept of teaching first aid skills to civilians. The first classes were conducted in the hall of the Presbyterian school in Woolwich (near Woolwich barracks where Shepherd was based) using a comprehensive first aid curriculum.\nFirst aid training began to spread through the British Empire through organisations such as St John, often starting, as in the UK, with high risk activities such as ports and railways.\nThe first recorded first aid training in the United States took place in Jermyn, Pennsylvania in 1899.\nMain emergences that require first aid and their corresponding cares.\nList of some situations that require specific first aid, and information about them (in alphabetical order):\nBleeding.\nA bleeding or hemorrhage is the uncontrolled escape of blood from any vein or artery.\nIn wounds that are caused by an external agent, there can be an additional risk of infection.\nCardiac arrest (total stop of heartbeat).\nA cardiac arrest is the complete stop of heart function.\nChoking.\nA choking is an obstruction in the airway\nDiabetes, hyperglycemia.\nA hyperglycemia or hyperglycaemia is an excessive level of blood sugars.\nDiabetes, hypoglycemia.\nA hypoglycemia or hypoglycaemia is an excessive fall of blood sugars in a diabetic patient.\nIt almost always occurs because of a problem with a medication to reduce the sugar level in blood.\nDrowning.\nA drowning is a suffocation into a liquid substance.\nFirst aid for drowning are very similar to those for cardiorespiratory arrest, but starting with 2 initial ventilations.\nInfarction of the heart.\nA cardiac infarction is the sudden lack of blood supply to the heart, normally because of a problem in one of its arteries.\nStroke.\nA stroke is a sudden lack of blood supply to the brain.\nAims of first aid.\nThe primary goal of first aid is to prevent death or serious injury from worsening. The key aims of first aid can be summarized with the acronym of 'the three Ps':\nFirst aid is not medical treatment, and cannot be compared with what a trained medical professional provides. First aid involves making common sense decisions in the best interest of an injured person.\nSetting the priorities.\nA first aid intervention would follow an order, which would try to attend in the best manner the main threats for the life and mobility of the victim.\nThere are some first aid protocols (such as ATLS, BATLS and SAFE-POINT) that define which are the priorities and the correct execution of the steps for saving human life. A major benefit of the use of official protocols is that they require minimum resources, time and skills, and have a great degree of success.\nABCDE and csABCDE general protocol.\nThe ABCDE method is the general protocol of first aid and implies a quite general view.\nIt was initially developed by Dr Peter Safar in the 1950s. But it has received some modifications, improvements and variations that were intended for more specific contexts. For example: it has been completed with improvements from the ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) version of the American College of Surgeons and the BATLS (Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support) version of the British Army.\nAs a result, the mnemonic of the steps of this protocol is ABCDE, or its improved version (cs)ABCDE (sometimes called xABCDE, the words in the mnemonic may vary), which represent:\n\u2014An attached first part (named as \"cs\" or \"x\", or in any other way) that will always mention stopping the critical losses of blood and managing with a special and careful treatment to patients with serious damages at the spine that threaten their future mobility:\n\u2014The ABCDE protocol itself:\nABC and CABD cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol.\nThis protocol (originally named as ABC) is a simplified version or concrete application of the previous csABCDE (or ABCDE) protocol, that focuses in the use of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. The American Heart Association and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation teach it as a reference.\nIts current mnemonic is CABD (an improvement in the sequence for most of the cases):\nWider protocols.\nThese are the protocols that do not only deal with direct care to the victim but they also mention other complementary tasks (before and later).\nEuropean protocol.\nThis method has been studied and employed for a long time in many European countries, as France. It is a reference, of a certain reputation, that could be applied solely or to a certain degree, usually combining it with the common csABCDE (ABCDE) method or its simplified CABD (ABC) variant about cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. The European method has a wider range than them, and their steps include tasks that are previous to the first aid techniques themselves.\nThese are its steps (with no official mnemonic that helps to remember them):\nOther mentionable protocols.\nSome other known protocols that could be mentioned in many contexts (in alphabetical order):\nAMEGA protocol\nIt is similar to the European protocol, because it also has a wider range than the common csABCDE (or ABCDE) protocol, and includes other tasks that are previous to the first aid techniques themselves. The order of the steps is changed, and the experience with it is lesser, but it adds the idea of a posterior 'aftermath' phase.\nThe mnemonic AMEGA refers to:\nATLS and BATLS protocols\nThey are basically the common ABCDE and csABCDE protocol, but focusing in particular aspects.\nThe ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) version was developed by the American College of Surgeons, focusing in the particular needs of trauma and specifically in the spinal injuries. And the BATLS (Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support) version is an improvement for the British Army that added the concept of 'catastrophic bleeding'.\nThe preference for one or another among all these protocols can depend on the context and the audience.\nCheck, Call and Care protocol.\nIt comes from Red Cross and, as the European protocol, has a wider range than the common csABCDE (ABCDE) method. So it could be seen as a simplification of the European protocol, and, especially, easier to remember as a guide for most of cases.\nIt mentions the following steps:\nSAFE-POINT protocol.\nAnother European protocol, which appeared in the field of construction of Czech Republic to react to any emergence .\nTheir steps (which have not any mnemonic) are:\nKey basic skills.\nCertain skills are considered essential to the provision of first aid and are taught ubiquitously.\nDisplacement skills.\nIf there are dangers around (such as fire, electric dangers or others) the patient has to be moved to a safe place, (if it is safe for the first aid provider to do so), where providing the required first aid procedures is possible.\n\u2014In case of a possible severe spinal injury: when a patient seems to have a possible serious injury in the spinal cord (in the backbone, either at the neck part or the back part), that patient must not be moved except if that is necessary, and, when necessary, it must be done as little as possible and very carefully (see mentions about this type of injury in the gallery of drawings below). These precautions avoid many risks of causing further damages for the patient's mobility in the future.\nUsually, the patient needs to end up lying down, in a face-up position, on a sufficiently firm surface (for example, on the floor, which allows to perform the chest compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation).\nChecking skills.\nThey evaluate the condition of the victim, first attending to the main threats for life.\nThe preferred initial way of checking consist of asking, commonly by touching the patient in one of his shoulders and shouting something, such as: \"can you hear me?\"\nIn some cases, the victim has a wound that bleeds abundantly, which requires its own additional treatment to stop the blood loss (usually, it would begin by keeping the wound pressed).\nIf the patient does not react, the heartbeats can be checked in the carotid pulse: placing two fingers on any side of the neck (on the left or the right side), near his head. In cases where checking the carotid pulse is impossible, heartbeats can be perceived in the radial pulse: placing two fingers on a wrist, under the part of the thumb, and applying moderate pressure. Breathing can also be checked additionally, placing an ear on the mouth and, at the same time, watching the chest rising by the effect of the air. It is recommended not to waste too much time of first aid in checking (professional rescuers are taught to take 10 seconds in it).\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the method of first aid for treating victims of cardiac arrest (complete stop of heartbeat).\nAirway, Breathing, and Circulation skills.\nABC method stands for \"Airway\", \"Breathing\", and \"Circulation\". The same mnemonic is used by emergency health professionals.\nIt is focused on critical life-saving intervention, and it must be rendered before treatment of less serious injuries.\nAttention must first be brought to the airway to ensure it is clear. An obstruction (choking) is a life-threatening emergency. If an object blocks the airway, it requires . Following any evaluation of the airway, a first aid attendant would determine adequacy of breathing and provide rescue breathing if safe to do so.\nAssessment of circulation is now not usually carried out for patients who are not breathing, with first aiders now trained to go straight to chest compressions (and thus providing artificial circulation) but pulse checks may be done on less serious patients.\nSome organizations add a fourth step of \"D\" for \"Deadly bleeding\" or \"Defibrillation\", while others consider this as part of the \"Circulation\" step simply referred as Disability. Variations on techniques to evaluate and maintain the ABCs depend on the skill level of the first aider. Once the ABCs are secured, first aiders can begin additional treatments or examination, as required if they possess the proper training (such as measuring pupil dilation).\nSome organizations teach the same order of priority using the \"3Bs\": \"Breathing\", \"Bleeding\", and \"Bones\" (or \"4Bs\": \"Breathing\", \"Bleeding\", \"Burns\", and \"Bones\"). While the ABCs and 3Bs are taught to be performed sequentially, certain conditions may require the consideration of two steps simultaneously. This includes the provision of both artificial respiration and chest compressions to someone who is not breathing and has no pulse, and the consideration of cervical spine injuries when ensuring an open airway.\nPreserving life.\nThe patient must have an open airway\u2014that is, an unobstructed passage that allows air to travel from the open mouth or uncongested nose, down through the pharynx and into the lungs. Conscious people maintain their own airway automatically, but those who are unconscious (with a GCS of less than 8) may be unable to do so, as the part of the brain that manages spontaneous breathing may not be functioning.\nWhether conscious or not, the patient may be placed in the recovery position, laying on their side. In addition to relaxing the patient, this can have the effect of clearing the tongue from the pharynx. It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents.\nThe airway can also become blocked by a foreign object. To dislodge the object and solve the choking case, the first aider may use (such as 'back slaps, 'chest thrusts' or 'abdominal thrusts').\nOnce the airway has been opened, the first aider would reassess the patient's breathing. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally (e.g., agonal breathing), the first aider would initiate CPR, which attempts to restart the patient's breathing by forcing air into the lungs. They may also manually massage the heart to promote blood flow around the body.\nIf the choking person is an infant, the first aider may use anti-choking methods for babies. During that procedure, series of five strong blows are delivered on the infant's upper back after placing the infant's face in the aider's forearm. If the infant is able to cough or cry, no breathing assistance should be given. Chest thrusts can also be applied with two fingers on the lower half of the middle of the chest. Coughing and crying indicate the airway is open and the foreign object will likely to come out from the force the coughing or crying produces.\nA first responder should know how to use an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) in the case of a person having a sudden cardiac arrest. The survival rate of those who have a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital is low. Permanent brain damage sets in after five minutes of no oxygen delivery, so rapid action on the part of the rescuer is necessary. An AED is a device that can examine a heartbeat and produce electric shocks to restart the heart.\nA first aider should be prepared to quickly deal with less severe problems such as cuts, grazes or bone fracture. They may be able to completely resolve a situation if they have the proper training and equipment. For situations that are more severe, complex or dangerous, a first aider might need to do the best they can with the equipment they have, and wait for an ambulance to arrive at the scene.\nFirst aid kits.\nA first aid kit consists of a strong, durable bag or transparent plastic box. They are commonly identified with a white cross on a green background. A first aid kit does not have to be bought ready-made. The advantage of ready-made first aid kits are that they have well organized compartments and familiar layouts.\nContents.\nThere is no universal agreement upon the list for the contents of a first aid kit. The UK Health and Safety Executive stress that the contents of workplace first aid kits will vary according to the nature of the work activities. As an example of possible contents of a kit, British Standard BS 8599 \"First Aid Kits for the Workplace\" lists the following items:\nTraining principles.\nBasic principles, such as knowing the use of adhesive bandage or applying direct pressure on a bleed, are often acquired passively through life experiences. However, to provide effective, life-saving first aid interventions requires instruction and practical training. This is especially true where it relates to potentially fatal illnesses and injuries, such as those that require CPR; these procedures may be invasive, and carry a risk of further injury to the patient and the provider. As with any training, it is more useful if it occurs \"before\" an actual emergency. And, in many countries, calling emergency medical services allows listening basic first aid instructions over the phone while the ambulance is on the way.\nTraining is generally provided by attending a course, typically leading to certification. Due to regular changes in procedures and protocols, based on updated clinical knowledge, and to maintain skill, attendance at regular refresher courses or re-certification is often necessary. First aid training is often available through community organizations such as the Red Cross and St. John Ambulance, or through commercial providers, who will train people for a fee. This commercial training is most common for training of employees to perform first aid in their workplace. Many community organizations also provide a commercial service, which complements their community programmes.\n1.Junior level certificate Basic Life Support\n2.Senior level certificate\n3.Special certificate\nTypes of first aid which require training.\nThere are several types of first aid (and first aider) that require specific additional training. These are usually undertaken to fulfill the demands of the work or activity undertaken.\nFirst aid services.\nSome people undertake specific training in order to provide first aid at public or private events, during filming, or other places where people gather. They may be designated as a \"first aider\", or use some other title. This role may be undertaken on a voluntary basis, with organisations such as the Red Cross society and St. John Ambulance, or as paid employment with a medical contractor.\nPeople performing a first aid role, whether in a professional or voluntary capacity, are often expected to have a high level of first aid training and are often uniformed.\nSymbols.\nAlthough commonly associated with first aid, the symbol of a red cross is an official protective symbol of the Red Cross. According to the Geneva Conventions and other international laws, the use of this and similar symbols is reserved for official agencies of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, and as a protective emblem for medical personnel and facilities in combat situations. Use by any other person or organization is illegal, and may lead to prosecution.\nThe internationally accepted symbol for first aid is the white cross on a green background shown below.\nSome organizations may make use of the Star of Life, although this is usually reserved for use by ambulance services, or may use symbols such as the Maltese Cross, like the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and St John Ambulance. Other symbols may also be used."}
{"id": "11298", "revid": "42964511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11298", "title": "Feudalism", "text": "Feudalism, also known as the feudal system, was a combination of legal, economic, military, cultural, and political customs that flourished in medieval Europe from the 9th to 15th centuries. Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour. \nThe classic definition, by Fran\u00e7ois Louis Ganshof (1944), describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations of the warrior nobility and revolved around the key concepts of lords, vassals, and fiefs. A broader definition, as described by Marc Bloch (1939), includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but the obligations of all three estates of the realm: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasantry, all of whom were bound by a system of manorialism; this is sometimes referred to as a \"feudal society\". \nAlthough it is derived from the Latin word \"feodum\" or \"feudum\" (fief), which was used during the medieval period, the term \"feudalism\" and the system it describes were not conceived of as a formal political system by the people who lived during the Middle Ages. Since the publication of Elizabeth A. R. Brown's \"The Tyranny of a Construct\" (1974) and Susan Reynolds's \"Fiefs and Vassals\" (1994), there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.\nDefinition.\nThe adjective \"feudal\" was in use by at least 1405, and the noun \"feudalism\" was in use by the end of the 18th century, paralleling the French .\nAccording to a classic definition by Ganshof, \"feudalism\" describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations of the warrior nobility that revolved around the key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs, though Ganshof himself noted that his treatment was only related to the \"narrow, technical, legal sense of the word.\"\nA broader definition, as described in Bloch's 1939 \"Feudal Society\", includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but the obligations of all three estates of the realm: the nobility, the clergy, and those who lived off their labour, most directly the peasantry, which was bound by a system of manorialism. This order is often referred to as a \"feudal society\", echoing Bloch's usage.\nOutside its European context, the concept of feudalism can be extended to analogous social structures in other regions, most often in discussions of feudal Japan under the \"shoguns\", and sometimes in discussions of the Zagwe dynasty in medieval Ethiopia, which had some feudal characteristics (sometimes called \"semifeudal\"). Some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing feudalism (or traces of it) in places as diverse as Spring and Autumn period China, ancient Egypt, the Parthian Empire, India until the Mughal dynasty and the Antebellum South and Jim Crow laws in the American South.\nThe term \"feudalism\" has also been applied\u2014often pejoratively\u2014to non-Western societies where institutions and attitudes similar to those in medieval Europe are perceived to prevail. Some historians and political theorists believe that the term \"feudalism\" has been deprived of specific meaning by the many ways it has been used, leading them to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.\nThe applicability of the term feudalism has also been questioned in the context of some Central and Eastern European countries, such as Poland and Lithuania, with scholars observing that the medieval political and economic structure of those countries bears some, but not all, resemblances to the Western European societies commonly described as feudal.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"feudal\" comes from the medieval Latin \"feud\u0101lis\", the adjectival form of \"feudum\" 'fee, feud', first attested in a charter of Charles the Fat in 884, which is related to Old French \"f\u00e9, fi\u00e9,\" Proven\u00e7al \"feo, feu, fieu,\" and Italian \"fio\". The ultimate origin of \"feud\u0101lis\" is unclear. It may come from a Germanic word, perhaps \"fehu\" or \"*feh\u00f4d\", but these words are not attested in this meaning in Germanic sources, or even in the Latin of the Frankish laws.\nOne theory about the origin of \"fehu\" was proposed by Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern in 1870, being supported by, amongst others, William Stubbs and Marc Bloch. Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term \"*fehu-\u00f4d\", in which \"*fehu\" means 'cattle' and \"-\u00f4d\" means 'goods', implying \"a movable object of value\". Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as \"feos\", a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word \"feos\" meaning 'movable property' would have changed to \"feus\", meaning the exact opposite: 'landed property'.\nArchibald Ross Lewis proposes that the origin of \"fief\" is not \"feudum\" (or \"feodum\"), but rather \"foderum\", the earliest attested use being in \"Vita Hludovici\" (840) by Astronomus. In that text is a passage about Louis the Pious that says , which can be translated as \"Louis forbade that military provender (which they popularly call \"fodder\") be furnished.\"\nInitially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a (Latin). Later, the term , or , began to replace in the documents. The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one-hundred years earlier. The origin of the and why it replaced has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.\nThe term \"f\u00e9odal\" was first used in 17th-century French legal treatises (1614) and translated into English legal treatises as an adjective, such as \"feodal government\".\nIn the 18th century, Adam Smith, seeking to describe economic systems, effectively coined the forms \"feudal government\" and \"feudal system\" in his book \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776). The phrase \"feudal system\" appeared in 1736, in \"Baronia Anglica\", published nine years after the death of its author Thomas Madox, in 1727. In 1771, in his book \"The History of Manchester\", John Whitaker first introduced the word \"feudalism\" and the notion of the feudal pyramid.\nAnother theory by Alauddin Samarrai suggests an Arabic origin, from \"fuy\u016b\" (the plural of \"fay\", which literally means 'the returned', and was used especially for 'land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight'). Samarrai's theory is that early forms of 'fief' include \"feo\", \"feu\", \"feuz\", \"feuum\" and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a loanword. The first use of these terms is in Languedoc, one of the least Germanic areas of Europe and bordering Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain). Further, the earliest use of \"feuum\" (as a replacement for \"beneficium\") can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at Fraxinetum (La Garde-Freinet) in Provence was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to transliterate the Arabic word \"fuy\u016b\" (the plural of \"fay\"), which was used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms \u2013 \"feo, feu, feuz, feuum\" and others\u2014from which eventually \"feudum\" derived. Samarrai, however, also advises to handle this theory with care, as Medieval and Early Modern Muslim scribes often used etymologically \"fanciful roots\" to support outlandish claims that something was of Arabian or Muslim origin.\nHistory.\nFeudalism, in its various forms, usually emerged as a result of the decentralization of an empire: such as in the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century AD, which lacked the bureaucratic infrastructure[] necessary to support cavalry without allocating land to these mounted troops. Mounted soldiers began to secure a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land and their power over the territory came to encompass the social, political, judicial, and economic spheres.\nThese acquired powers significantly diminished unitary power in these empires. However, once the infrastructure to maintain unitary power was re-established\u2014as with the European monarchies\u2014feudalism began to yield to this new power structure and eventually disappeared.\nClassic feudalism.\nThe classic Fran\u00e7ois Louis Ganshof version of feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations of the warrior nobility based on the key concepts of lords, vassals, and fiefs. In broad terms a lord was a noble who held land, a vassal was a person granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and protection by the lord, the vassal provided some sort of service to the lord. There were many varieties of feudal land tenure, consisting of military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.\nVassalage.\nBefore a lord could grant land (a fief) to someone, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a commendation ceremony, which was composed of the two-part act of homage and oath of fealty. During homage, the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces. \"Fealty\" comes from the Latin \"fidelitas\" and denotes the fidelity owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. \"Fealty\" also refers to an oath that more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage; such an oath follows homage.\nOnce the commendation ceremony was complete, the lord and vassal were in a feudal relationship with agreed obligations to one another. The vassal's principal obligation to the lord was to provide aid or military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal had to answer calls to military service by the lord. This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship. In addition, the vassal could have other obligations to his lord, such as attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial, both termed court baron, or at the king's court.\nIt could also involve the vassal providing \"counsel\", so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. At the level of the manor this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included sentencing by the lord for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king's feudal court, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. These are examples of feudalism; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied.\nThe feudal revolution in France.\nIn its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of \"politics of land\" (an expression used by the historian Marc Bloch). The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a \"feudal revolution\" or \"mutation\" and a \"fragmentation of powers\" (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or in Germany in the same period or later: Counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as castellans and lesser \"seigneurs\" took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, including travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations, use the lord's mill and, most importantly, the highly profitable rights of justice, etc. (what Georges Duby called collectively the \"seigneurie banale\"). Power in this period became more personal.\nThis \"fragmentation of powers\" was not, however, systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later. Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords. In response to this, the idea of a \"liege lord\" was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.\nEnd of European feudalism (1500\u20131850s).\nAround this time, rich, \"middle-class\" commoners chafed at the authority and powers held by feudal lords, overlords, and nobles, and preferred the idea of autocratic rule where a king and one royal court held almost all the power. Feudal nobles regardless of ethnicity generally thought of themselves as arbiters of a politically free system, so this often puzzled them before the fall of most feudal laws.\nMost of the military aspects of feudalism effectively ended by about 1500. This was partly since the military shifted from armies consisting of the nobility to professional fighters thus reducing the nobility's claim on power, but also because the Black Death reduced the nobility's hold over the lower classes. Vestiges of the feudal system hung on in France until the French Revolution of the 1790s. Even when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian Georges Lefebvre explains how at an early stage of the French Revolution, on just one night of 4 August 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order. It announced, \"The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.\" Lefebvre explains:\nOriginally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a quarter of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners. The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.\nIn the Kingdom of France, following the French Revolution, feudalism was abolished with a decree of 11 August 1789 by the Constituent Assembly, a provision that was later extended to various parts of Italian kingdom following the invasion by French troops. In the Kingdom of Naples, Joachim Murat abolished feudalism with the law of 2 August 1806, then implemented with a law of 1 September 1806 and a royal decree of 3 December 1808. In the Kingdom of Sicily the abolishing law was issued by the Sicilian Parliament on 10 August 1812. In Piedmont feudalism ceased by virtue of the edicts of 7 March, and 19 July 1797 issued by Charles Emmanuel IV, although in the Kingdom of Sardinia, specifically on the island of Sardinia, feudalism was abolished only with an edict of 5 August 1848.\nIn the Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia, feudalism was abolished with the law of 5 December 1861 n.\u00ba 342 were all feudal bonds abolished. The system lingered on in parts of Central and Eastern Europe as late as the 1850s. Slavery in Romania was abolished in 1856. Russia finally abolished serfdom in 1861.\nMore recently in Scotland, on 28 November 2004, the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 entered into full force putting an end to what was left of the Scottish feudal system. The last feudal regime, that of the island of Sark, was abolished in December 2008, when the first democratic elections were held for the election of a local parliament and the appointment of a government. The \"revolution\" is a consequence of the juridical intervention of the European Parliament, which declared the local constitutional system as contrary to human rights, and, following a series of legal battles, imposed parliamentary democracy.\nFeudal society.\nThe phrase \"feudal society\" as defined by Marc Bloch offers a wider definition than Ganshof's and includes within the feudal structure not only the warrior aristocracy bound by vassalage, but also the peasantry bound by manorialism, and the estates of the Church. Thus the feudal order embraces society from top to bottom, though the \"powerful and well-differentiated social group of the urban classes\" came to occupy a distinct position to some extent outside the classic feudal hierarchy.\nHistoriography.\nThe idea of \"feudalism\" was unknown and the system it describes was not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the medieval period. This section describes the history of the idea of feudalism, how the concept originated among scholars and thinkers, how it changed over time, and modern debates about its use.\nEvolution of the concept.\nThe concept of a feudal state or period, in the sense of either a regime or a period dominated by lords who possess financial or social power and prestige, became widely held in the middle of the 18th century, as a result of works such as Montesquieu's (1748; published in English as \"The Spirit of Law\"), and Henri de Boulainvilliers's (1737; published in English as \"An Historical Account of the Ancient Parliaments of France or States-General of the Kingdom\", 1739). In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the , or French monarchy. This was the Age of Enlightenment, when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the \"Dark Ages\". Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the \"Dark Ages\" including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain. For them \"feudalism\" meant seigneurial privileges and prerogatives. When the French Constituent Assembly abolished the \"feudal regime\" in August 1789, this is what was meant. \nAdam Smith used the term \"feudal system\" to describe a social and economic system defined by inherited social ranks, each of which possessed inherent social and economic privileges and obligations. In such a system, wealth derived from agriculture, which was arranged not according to market forces but on the basis of customary labour services owed by serfs to landowning nobles.\nHeinrich Brunner.\nHeinrich Brunner, in his \"The Equestrian Service and the Beginnings of the Feudal System\" (1887), maintained that Charles Martel laid the foundation for feudalism during the 8th century. Brunner believed Martel to be a brilliant warrior who secularized church lands for the purpose of providing \"precarias\" (or leases) for his followers, in return for their military service. Martel's military ambitions were becoming more expensive as it changed into a cavalry force, thus the need to maintain his followers through the despoiling of church lands. \nResponding to Brunner's thesis, Paul Fouracre theorizes that the church itself held power over the land with its own \"precarias\". The most commonly utilized \"precarias\" was the gifting of land to the church, done for various spiritual and legal purposes. Although Charles Martel did indeed utilize \"precaria\" for his own purposes, and even drove some of the bishops out of the church and placed his own laymen in their seats, Fouracre discounts Martel's role in creating political change, that it was simply a military move in order to have control in the region by hording land through tenancies, and expelling the bishops who he did not agree with, but it did not specifically create feudalism. \u00a0\nKarl Marx.\nKarl Marx also uses the term in the 19th century in his analysis of society's economic and political development, describing feudalism (or more usually feudal society or the feudal mode of production) as the order coming before capitalism. For Marx, what defined feudalism was the power of the ruling class (the aristocracy) in their control of arable land, leading to a class society based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under serfdom and principally by means of labour, produce and money rents. He deemed feudalism a 'democracy of unfreedom', juxtaposing the oppression of feudal subjects with a holistic integration of political and economic life of the sort lacking under industrial capitalism.\nHe also took it as a paradigm for understanding the power-relationships between capitalists and wage-labourers in his own time: \"in pre-capitalist systems it was obvious that most people did not control their own destiny\u2014under feudalism, for instance, serfs had to work for their lords. Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs.\" Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. Eric Wolf) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with imperial China and the Inca Empire, in the pre-Columbian era, as 'tributary' societies .\nLater studies.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, J. Horace Round and Frederic William Maitland, both historians of medieval Britain, arrived at different conclusions about the character of Anglo-Saxon English society before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Round argued that the Normans had brought feudalism with them to England, while Maitland contended that its fundamentals were already in place in Britain before 1066. The debate continues today, but a consensus viewpoint is that England before the Conquest had commendation (which embodied some of the personal elements in feudalism) while William the Conqueror introduced a modified and stricter northern French feudalism to England incorporating (1086) oaths of loyalty to the king by all who held by feudal tenure, even the vassals of his principal vassals (holding by feudal tenure meant that vassals must provide the quota of knights required by the king or a money payment in substitution).\nIn the 20th century, two outstanding historians offered still more widely differing perspectives. The French historian Marc Bloch, arguably the most influential 20th-century medieval historian, approached feudalism not so much from a legal and military point of view but from a sociological one, presenting in \"Feudal Society\" (1939; English 1961) a feudal order not limited solely to the nobility. It is his radical notion that peasants were part of the feudal relationship that sets Bloch apart from his peers: while the vassal performed military service in exchange for the fief, the peasant performed physical labour in return for protection \u2013 both are a form of feudal relationship. According to Bloch, other elements of society can be seen in feudal terms; all the aspects of life were centred on \"lordship\", and so we can speak usefully of a feudal church structure, a feudal courtly (and anti-courtly) literature, and a feudal economy.\nIn contradistinction to Bloch, the Belgian historian Fran\u00e7ois Louis Ganshof defined feudalism from a narrow legal and military perspective, arguing that feudal relationships existed only within the medieval nobility itself. Ganshof articulated this concept in \"Qu'est-ce que la f\u00e9odalit\u00e9?\" (\"What is feudalism?\", 1944; translated in English as \"Feudalism\"). His classic definition of feudalism is widely accepted today among medieval scholars, though questioned both by those who view the concept in wider terms and by those who find insufficient uniformity in noble exchanges to support such a model.\nAlthough Georges Duby was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre, that came to be known as the Annales school, Duby was an exponent of the tradition. In a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled (\"Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the M\u00e2connais region\"), and working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian monastery of Cluny, as well as the dioceses of M\u00e2con and Dijon, Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the M\u00e2connais region and charted a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. He argued that in early 11th century, governing institutions\u2014particularly comital courts established under the Carolingian monarchy\u2014that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the 9th and 10th centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence.\nIn 1939, the Austrian historian Theodor Mayer subordinated the feudal state as secondary to his concept of a \"Personenverbandsstaat\" (personal interdependency state), understanding it in contrast to the territorial state. This form of statehood, identified with the Holy Roman Empire, is described as the most complete form of medieval rule, completing conventional feudal structure of lordship and vassalage with the personal association among the nobility. But the applicability of this concept to cases outside of the Holy Roman Empire has been questioned, as by Susan Reynolds. The concept has also been questioned and superseded in German historiography because of its bias and reductionism towards legitimating the .\nChallenges to the feudal model.\nIn 1974, the American historian Elizabeth A. R. Brown rejected the label \"feudalism\" as an anachronism that imparts a false sense of uniformity to the concept. Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of \"feudalism\", she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back \"tyrannically\" into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely. In \"Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted\" (1994), Susan Reynolds expanded upon Brown's original thesis. Although some contemporaries questioned Reynolds's methodology, other historians have supported it and her argument. Reynolds argues:\nThe term \"feudal\" has also been applied to non-Western societies, in which institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to have prevailed (see Examples of feudalism). Japan has been extensively studied in this regard. Karl Friday notes that in the 21st century historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences. Ultimately, critics say, the many ways the term \"feudalism\" has been used have deprived it of specific meaning, leading some historians and political theorists to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.\nHistorian Richard Abels notes that \"Western civilization and world civilization textbooks now shy away from the term 'feudalism'.\""}
{"id": "11299", "revid": "2273576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11299", "title": "Fox", "text": "Foxes are small-to-medium-sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull; upright, triangular ears; a pointed, slightly upturned snout; and a long, bushy tail (\"brush\").\nTwelve species belong to the monophyletic \"true fox\" group of genus \"Vulpes\". Another 25 current or extinct species are sometimes called foxes \u2013 they are part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes or an outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.\nFoxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (\"Vulpes vulpes\") with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"fox\" comes from Old English and derives from Proto-Germanic *\"fuhsaz\". This in turn derives from Proto-Indo-European *\"pu\u1e31-\" \"thick-haired, tail.\" Male foxes are known as \"dogs\", \"tods\", or \"reynards\"; females as \"vixens\"; and young as \"cubs\", \"pups\", or \"kits\", though the last term is not to be confused with the kit fox, a distinct species. \"Vixen\" is one of very few modern English words that retain the Middle English southern dialectal \"v\" pronunciation instead of \"f\"; i.e., northern English \"fox\" versus southern English \"vox\". A group of foxes is referred to as a \"skulk\", \"leash\", or \"earth\".\nPhylogenetic relationships.\nWithin the Canidae, the results of DNA analysis shows several phylogenetic divisions:\nBiology.\nGeneral morphology.\nFoxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family Canidae such as wolves and jackals, while they may be larger than some within the family, such as raccoon dogs. In the largest species, the red fox, males weigh between , while the smallest species, the fennec fox, weighs just .\nFox features typically include a triangular face, pointed ears, an elongated rostrum, and a bushy tail. They are digitigrade (meaning they walk on their toes). Unlike most members of the family Canidae, foxes have partially retractable claws. Fox vibrissae, or whiskers, are black. The whiskers on the muzzle, known as mystacial vibrissae, average long, while the whiskers everywhere else on the head average to be shorter in length. Whiskers (carpal vibrissae) are also on the forelimbs and average long, pointing downward and backward. Other physical characteristics vary according to habitat and adaptive significance.\nPelage.\nFox species differ in fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to black-and-white to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted to life in the desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, insulating fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with a white marking.\nA fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the feet, up the legs, and then along the back. Coat color may also change as the individual ages.\nDentition.\nA fox's dentition, like all other canids, is I 3/3, C 1/1, PM 4/4, M 3/2 = 42. (Bat-eared foxes have six extra molars, totalling in 48 teeth.) Foxes have pronounced carnassial pairs, which is characteristic of a carnivore. These pairs consist of the upper premolar and the lower first molar, and work together to shear tough material like flesh. Foxes' canines are pronounced, also characteristic of a carnivore, and are excellent in gripping prey.\nBehaviour.\nIn the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years, although individuals may live up to ten years. Unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in small family groups, but some (such as Arctic foxes) are known to be solitary.\nFoxes are omnivores. Their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds. They may also eat eggs and vegetation. Many species are generalist predators, but some (such as the crab-eating fox) have more specialized diets. Most species of fox consume around of food every day. Foxes cache excess food, burying it for later consumption, usually under leaves, snow, or soil. While hunting, foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique, such that they crouch down to camouflage themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey. Using their pronounced canine teeth, they can then grip the prey's neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweled.\nThe gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees; the other is the raccoon dog.\nSexual characteristics.\nThe male fox's scrotum is held up close to the body with the testes inside even after they descend. Like other canines, the male fox has a baculum, or penile bone. The testes of red foxes are smaller than those of Arctic foxes. Sperm formation in red foxes begins in August\u2013September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in December\u2013February.\nVixens are in heat for one to six days, making their reproductive cycle twelve months long. As with other canines, the ova are shed during estrus without the need for the stimulation of copulating. Once the egg is fertilized, the vixen enters a period of gestation that can last from 52 to 53 days. Foxes tend to have an average litter size of four to five with an 80 percent success rate in becoming pregnant. Litter sizes can vary greatly according to species and environmentthe Arctic fox, for example, can have up to eleven kits.\nThe vixen usually has six or eight mammae. Each teat has 8 to 20 lactiferous ducts, which connect the mammary gland to the nipple, allowing for milk to be carried to the nipple.\nVocalization.\nThe fox's vocal repertoire is vast, and includes:\nIn the case of domesticated foxes, the whining seems to remain in adult individuals as a sign of excitement and submission in the presence of their owners.\nClassification.\nCanids commonly known as foxes include the following genera and species:\nConservation.\nSeveral fox species are endangered in their native environments. Pressures placed on foxes include habitat loss and being hunted for pelts, other trade, or control. Due in part to their opportunistic hunting style and industriousness, foxes are commonly resented as nuisance animals. Contrastingly, foxes, while often considered pests themselves, have been successfully employed to control pests on fruit farms while leaving the fruit intact.\n\"Urocyon littoralis\".\nThe island fox, though considered a near-threatened species throughout the world, is becoming increasingly endangered in its endemic environment of the California Channel Islands. A population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resources like space, food and shelter. Island populations are therefore highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather.\nOn the California Channel Islands, it was found that the population of the island fox was so low due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus from 1999 to 2000 as well as predation by non-native golden eagles. Since 1993, the eagles have caused the population to decline by as much as 95%. Because of the low number of foxes, the population went through an Allee effect (an effect in which, at low enough densities, an individual's fitness decreases). Conservationists had to take healthy breeding pairs out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until they had enough foxes to release back into the wild. Nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plants would be able to grow back to their natural height, thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the foxes against golden eagles.\n\"Pseudalopex fulvipes\".\nDarwin's fox was considered critically endangered because of their small known population of 250 mature individuals as well as their restricted distribution. However, the IUCN have since downgraded the conservation status from crictically endangered in their 2004 and 2008 assessments to endangered in the 2016 assessment, following findings of a wider distribution than previously reported. On the Chilean mainland, the population is limited to Nahuelbuta National Park and the surrounding Valdivian rainforest. Similarly on Chilo\u00e9 Island, their population is limited to the forests that extend from the southernmost to the northwesternmost part of the island. Though the Nahuelbuta National Park is protected, 90% of the species live on Chilo\u00e9 Island.\nA major issue the species faces is their dwindling, limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forests. Because of deforestation, the Darwin's fox habitat is shrinking, allowing for their competitor's (chilla fox) preferred habitat of open space, to increase; the Darwin's fox, subsequently, is being outcompeted. Another problem they face is their inability to fight off diseases transmitted by the increasing number of pet dogs. To conserve these animals, researchers suggest the need for the forests that link the Nahuelbuta National Park to the coast of Chile and in turn Chilo\u00e9 Island and its forests, to be protected. They also suggest that other forests around Chile be examined to determine whether Darwin's foxes have previously existed there or can live there in the future, should the need to reintroduce the species to those areas arise. And finally, the researchers advise for the creation of a captive breeding program, in Chile, because of the limited number of mature individuals in the wild.\nRelationships with humans.\nFoxes are often considered pests or nuisance creatures for their opportunistic attacks on poultry and other small livestock. Fox attacks on humans are not common.\nMany foxes adapt well to human environments, with several species classified as \"resident urban carnivores\" for their ability to sustain populations entirely within urban boundaries. Foxes in urban areas can live longer and can have smaller litter sizes than foxes in non-urban areas. Urban foxes are ubiquitous in Europe, where they show altered behaviors compared to non-urban foxes, including increased population density, smaller territory, and pack foraging. Foxes have been introduced in numerous locations, with varying effects on indigenous flora and fauna.\nIn some countries, foxes are major predators of rabbits and hens. Population oscillations of these two species were the first nonlinear oscillation studied and led to the derivation of the Lotka\u2013Volterra equation.\nAs food.\nFox meat is edible, though it is not considered a common cuisine in any country.\nHunting.\nFox hunting originated in the United Kingdom in the 16th century. Hunting with dogs is now banned in the United Kingdom, though hunting without dogs is still permitted. Red foxes were introduced into Australia in the early 19th century for sport, and have since become widespread through much of the country. They have caused population decline among many native species and prey on livestock, especially new lambs. Fox hunting is practiced as recreation in several other countries including Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Russia, United States and Australia.\nDomestication.\nThere are many records of domesticated red foxes and others, but rarely of sustained domestication. A recent and notable exception is the Russian silver fox, which resulted in visible and behavioral changes, and is a case study of an animal population modeling according to human domestication needs. The current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the Soviet Union and Russia to \"de novo\" domesticate the silver morph of the red fox. This selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats, dogs, and other animals, such as pigmentation changes, floppy ears, and curly tails. Notably, the new foxes became more tame, allowing themselves to be petted, whimpering to get attention and sniffing and licking their caretakers.\nUrban settings.\nFoxes are among the comparatively few mammals which have been able to adapt themselves to a certain degree to living in urban (mostly suburban) human environments. Their omnivorous diet allows them to survive on discarded food waste, and their skittish and often nocturnal nature means that they are often able to avoid detection, despite their larger size.\nUrban foxes have been identified as threats to cats and small dogs, and for this reason there is often pressure to exclude them from these environments.\nThe San Joaquin kit fox is a highly endangered species that has, ironically, become adapted to urban living in the San Joaquin Valley and Salinas Valley of southern California. Its diet includes mice, ground squirrels, rabbits, hares, bird eggs, and insects, and it has claimed habitats in open areas, golf courses, drainage basins, and school grounds.\nThough rare, bites by foxes have been reported; in 2018, a woman in Clapham, London was bitten on the arm by a fox after she had left the door to her flat open.\nIn popular culture.\nThe fox appears in many cultures, usually in folklore. There are slight variations in their depictions. In European, Persian, East Asian, and Native American folklore, foxes are symbols of cunning and trickery\u2014a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunters. This is usually represented as a character possessing these traits. These traits are used on a wide variety of characters, either making them a nuisance to the story, a misunderstood hero, or a devious villain.\nIn East Asian folklore, foxes are depicted as familiar spirits possessing magic powers. Similar to in the folklore of other regions, foxes are portrayed as mischievous, usually tricking other people, with the ability to disguise as an attractive female human. Others depict them as mystical, sacred creatures who can bring wonder or ruin. Nine-tailed foxes appear in Chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, in which, depending on the tale, they can be a good or a bad omen. The motif was eventually introduced from Chinese to Japanese and Korean cultures.\nThe constellation Vulpecula represents a fox."}

The main rival of the foundationalist theory of justification is the coherence theory of justification, whereby a body of knowledge, not requiring a secure foundation, can be established by the interlocking strength of its components, like a puzzle solved without prior certainty that each small region was solved correctly.\nIdentifying the alternatives as either circular reasoning or infinite regress, and thus exhibiting the regress problem, Aristotle made foundationalism his own clear choice, positing basic beliefs underpinning others. Descartes, the most famed foundationalist, discovered a foundation in the fact of his own existence and in the \"clear and distinct\" ideas of reason, whereas Locke found a foundation in experience. Differing foundations may reflect differing epistemological emphases\u2014empiricists emphasizing \"experience\", rationalists emphasizing \"reason\"\u2014but may blend both.\nIn the 1930s, debate over foundationalism revived. Whereas Moritz Schlick viewed scientific knowledge like a pyramid where a special class of statements does not require verification through other beliefs and serves as a foundation, Otto Neurath argued that scientific knowledge lacks an ultimate foundation and acts like a raft. In the 1950s, the dominance of foundationalism was challenged by a number of philosophers such as Willard Van Orman Quine and Wilfrid Sellars. Quine's ontological relativity found any belief networked to one's beliefs on all of reality, while auxiliary beliefs somewhere in the vast network are readily modified to protect desired beliefs.\nClassically, foundationalism had posited infallibility of basic beliefs and deductive reasoning between beliefs\u2014a strong foundationalism. Around 1975, weak foundationalism emerged. Thus recent foundationalists have variously allowed fallible basic beliefs, and inductive reasoning between them, either by enumerative induction or by inference to the best explanation. And whereas internalists require cognitive access to justificatory means, externalists find justification without such access.\nHistory.\nFoundationalism was initiated by French early modern philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes. In his \"Meditations\", Descartes challenged the contemporary principles of philosophy by arguing that everything he knew he learnt from or through his senses. He used various arguments to challenge the reliability of the senses, citing previous errors and the possibilities that he was dreaming or being deceived by an Evil Demon which rendered all of his beliefs about the external world false. Descartes attempted to establish the secure foundations for knowledge to avoid scepticism. He contrasted the information provided by senses, which is unclear and uncertain, with the truths of geometry, which are clear and distinct. Geometrical truths are also certain and indubitable; Descartes thus attempted to find truths which were clear and distinct because they would be indubitably true and a suitable foundation for knowledge. His method was to question all of his beliefs until he reached something clear and distinct that was indubitably true. The result was his \"cogito ergo sum\" \u2013 'I think therefore I am', or the belief that he was thinking \u2013 as his indubitable belief suitable as a foundation for knowledge. This resolved Descartes' problem of the Evil Demon. Even if his beliefs about the external world were false, his beliefs about what he was experiencing were still indubitably true, even if those perceptions do not relate to anything in the world.\nSeveral other philosophers of the early modern period, including John Locke, G. W. Leibniz, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Thomas Reid, accepted foundationalism as well. Baruch Spinoza was interpreted as metaphysical foundationalist by G. W. F. Hegel, a proponent of coherentism. Immanuel Kant's foundationalism rests on his theory of categories.\nIn late modern philosophy, foundationalism was defended by J. G. Fichte in his book \"Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre\" (1794/1795), Wilhelm Windelband in his book \"\u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntniss.\" (1873), and Gottlob Frege in his book \"Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik\" (1884).\nIn contemporary philosophy, foundationalism has been defended by Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell and John McDowell.\nDefinition.\nFoundationalism is an attempt to respond to the regress problem of justification in epistemology. According to this argument, every proposition requires justification to support it, but any justification also needs to be justified itself. If this goes on \"ad infinitum\", it is not clear how anything in the chain could be justified. Foundationalism holds that there are 'basic beliefs' which serve as foundations to anchor the rest of our beliefs. Strong versions of the theory assert that an indirectly justified belief is completely justified by basic beliefs; more moderate theories hold that indirectly justified beliefs require basic beliefs to be justified, but can be further justified by other factors.\nSince ancient Greece, Western philosophy has pursued a solid foundation as the ultimate and eternal reference system for all knowledge. This foundation serves not only as a starting point but also as the fundamental basis for understanding the truth of existence. Thinking is the process of proving the validity of knowledge, not proving the rationality of the foundation from which knowledge is shaped. This means, with ultimate cause, the foundation is true, absolute, entire and impossible to prove. Neopragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty, a proponent of anti-foundationalism, said that the fundamentalism confirmed the existence of the \"privileged representation\" which constitutes the foundation, from which dominates epistemology. The earliest foundationalism is Plato's theory of Forms, which shows the general concept as a model for the release of existence, which is only the faint copy of the Forms of eternity, that means, understanding the expression of objects leads to acquiring all knowledge, then acquiring knowledge accompanies achieving the truth. Achieving the truth means understanding the foundation. This idea still has some appeal in for example international relations studies.\nClassical foundationalism.\nFoundationalism holds basic beliefs exist, which are justified without reference to other beliefs, and that nonbasic beliefs must ultimately be justified by basic beliefs. Classical foundationalism maintains that basic beliefs must be infallible if they are to justify nonbasic beliefs, and that only deductive reasoning can be used to transfer justification from one belief to another. Laurence BonJour has argued that the classical formulation of foundationalism requires basic beliefs to be infallible, incorrigible, indubitable, and certain if they are to be adequately justified. Mental states and immediate experience are often taken as good candidates for basic beliefs because it is argued that beliefs about these do not need further support to be justified.\nModest foundationalism.\nAs an alternative to the classic view, modest foundationalism does not require that basic perceptual beliefs are infallible, but holds that it is reasonable to assume that perceptual beliefs are justified unless evidence to the contrary exists. This is still foundationalism because it maintains that all non-basic beliefs must be ultimately justified by basic beliefs, but it does not require that basic beliefs are infallible and allows inductive reasoning as an acceptable form of inference. For example, a belief that 'I see red' could be defeated with psychological evidence showing my mind to be confused or inattentive. Modest foundationalism can also be used to avoid the problem of inference. Even if perceptual beliefs are infallible, it is not clear that they can infallibly ground empirical knowledge (even if my belief that the table looks red to me is infallible, the inference to the belief that the table actually is red might not be infallible). Modest foundationalism does not require this link between perception and reality to be so strong; our perception of a table being yellow is adequate justification to believe that this is the case, even if it is not infallible.\nReformed epistemology is a form of modest foundationalism which takes religious beliefs as basic because they are non-inferentially justified: their justification arises from religious experience, rather than prior beliefs. This takes a modest approach to foundationalism \u2013 religious beliefs are not taken to be infallible, but are assumed to be \"prima facie\" justified unless evidence arises to the contrary.\nInternalism and externalism.\nFoundationalism can take internalist and externalist forms. Internalism requires that a believer's justification for a belief must be accessible to them for it to be justified. Foundationalist internalists have held that basic beliefs are justified by mental events or states, such as experiences, that do not constitute beliefs. Alternatively, basic beliefs may be justified by some special property of the belief itself, such as its being self-evident or infallible. Externalism maintains that it is unnecessary for the means of justification of a belief to be accessible to the believer.\nReliabilism is an externalist foundationalist theory, initially proposed by Alvin Goldman, which argues that a belief is justified if it is reliably produced, meaning that it will be probably true. Goldman distinguished between two kinds of justification for beliefs: belief-dependent and belief-independent. A belief-dependent process uses prior beliefs to produce new beliefs; a belief-independent process does not, using other stimuli instead. Beliefs produced this way are justified because the processes that cause them are reliable; this might be because we have evolved to reach good conclusions when presented with sense-data, meaning the conclusions we draw from our senses are usually true.\nCriticisms.\nCritics of foundationalism often argue that for a belief to be justified it must be supported by other beliefs; in Donald Davidson's phrase, \"only a belief can be a reason for another belief\". For instance, Wilfrid Sellars argued that non-doxastic mental states cannot be reasons, and so noninferential warrant cannot be derived from them. Similarly, critics of externalist foundationalism argue that only mental states or properties the believer is aware of could make a belief justified.\nPostmodernists and post-structuralists such as Richard Rorty and Jacques Derrida have attacked foundationalism on the grounds that the truth of a statement or discourse is only verifiable in accordance with other statements and discourses. Rorty in particular elaborates further on this, claiming that the individual, the community, the human body as a whole have a 'means by which they know the world' (this entails language, culture, semiotic systems, mathematics, science etc.). In order to verify particular means, or particular statements belonging to certain means (e.g., the propositions of the natural sciences), a person would have to 'step outside' the means and critique them neutrally, in order to provide a foundation for adopting them. However, this is impossible. The only way in which one can know the world is through the means by which they know the world; a method cannot justify itself. This argument can be seen as directly related to Wittgenstein's theory of language, drawing a parallel between postmodernism and late logical positivism that is united in critique of foundationalism."}

A member of this family is also called a felid ( ).\nThe 41 extant Felidae species exhibit the greatest diversity in fur patterns of all terrestrial carnivores. Cats have retractile claws, slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite. They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest and savanna habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species.\nReginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies: the Pantherinae, the Felinae and the Acinonychinae, differing from each other by the ossification of the hyoid apparatus and by the cutaneous sheaths which protect their claws.\nThis concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and techniques for the analysis of morphological data. Today, the living Felidae are divided into two subfamilies: the Pantherinae and Felinae, with the Acinonychinae subsumed into the latter. Pantherinae includes five \"Panthera\" and two \"Neofelis\" species, while Felinae includes the other 34 species in 12 genera.\nThe first cats emerged during the Oligocene about , with the appearance of \"Proailurus\" and \"Pseudaelurus\". The latter species complex was ancestral to two main lines of felids: the cats in the extant subfamilies, and the \"saber-toothed cats\" of the extinct subfamily Machairodontinae, including the famous \"Smilodon\".\nThe \"false saber-toothed cats\", the Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae, are not true cats but are closely related. Together with the Felidae, Viverridae, Nandiniidae, Eupleridae, hyenas and mongooses, they constitute the Feliformia.\nCharacteristics.\nAll members of the cat family have the following characteristics in common:\nThe colour, length and density of their fur are very diverse. Fur colour covers the gamut from white to black, and fur patterns from distinctive small spots, and stripes to small blotches and rosettes. Most cat species are born with spotted fur, except the jaguarundi (\"Herpailurus yagouaroundi\"), Asian golden cat (\"Catopuma temminckii\") and caracal (\"Caracal caracal\"). The spotted fur of lion (\"Panthera leo\"), cheetah (\"Acinonyx jubatus\") and cougar (\"Puma concolor\") cubs change to uniform fur during their ontogeny. Those living in cold environments have thick fur with long hair, like the snow leopard (\"Panthera uncia\") and the Pallas's cat (\"Otocolobus manul\"). Those living in tropical and hot climate zones have short fur. Several species exhibit melanism with all-black individuals, cougars are notable for lacking melanism but leucism and albinism are present in cougars along with many other felids.\nIn the great majority of cat species, the tail is between a third and a half of the body length, although with some exceptions, like the \"Lynx\" species and margay (\"Leopardus wiedii\"). Cat species vary greatly in body and skull sizes, and weights:\nMost cat species have a haploid number of 18 or 19. Central and South American cats have a haploid number of 18, possibly due to the combination of two smaller chromosomes into a larger one.\nFelidae have type IIx muscle fibers three times more powerful than the muscle fibers of human athletes.\nEvolution.\nThe family Felidae is part of the Feliformia, a suborder that diverged probably about into several families. The Felidae and the Asiatic linsangs are considered a sister group, which split about .\nThe earliest cats probably appeared about . \"Proailurus\" is the oldest known cat that occurred after the Eocene\u2013Oligocene extinction event about ; fossil remains were excavated in France and Mongolia's Hsanda Gol Formation. Fossil occurrences indicate that the Felidae arrived in North America around . This is about 20million years later than the Ursidae and the Nimravidae, and about 10\u00a0million years later than the Canidae.\nIn the Early Miocene about , \"Pseudaelurus\" lived in Africa. Its fossil jaws were also excavated in geological formations of Europe's Vallesian, Asia's Middle Miocene and North America's late Hemingfordian to late Barstovian epochs. Modelling of felid coat pattern transformations revealed that nearly all patterns evolved from small spots.\nDuring the Middle Miocene around 15 million years ago, the extinct subfamily Machairodontinae (colloquially known as \"saber-toothed cats\") emerged and became widespread across Afro-Eurasia and North America by the Late Miocene. With their large upper canine saber teeth, they were adapted to prey on large-bodied megaherbivores. During the Late Miocene and early Pliocene, machairodontines were the dominant cats and large mammalian predators across Afro-Eurasia and North America, with ancestors of living cats generally being small at this time.\nThe earliest members of the living cat lineages are known from the Middle Miocene, with the last common ancestor of living cats estimated to have lived around 16 million years ago. Large sized felines and pantherines only emerged during the Pliocene epoch, including the modern big cat genus \"Panthera.\" Felids entered South America as part of the Great American Interchange following the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene epoch.\nMachairodontines began to decline during the Pleistocene, perhaps as a result of environmental change and consequential changes in prey abundance, competition with large living cat lineages such as the pantherins as well as possibly archaic humans. The last species belonging to the genera \"Smilodon\" and \"Homotherium\" became extinct along with many other large mammals around 12-10,000 years ago as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event, following human arrival to the Americas at the end of the Late Pleistocene.\nClassification.\nTraditionally, five subfamilies had been distinguished within the Felidae based on phenotypical features: the Pantherinae, the Felinae, the Acinonychinae, and the extinct Machairodontinae and Proailurinae. Acinonychinae used to only contain the genus \"Acinonyx\" but this genus is now within the Felinae subfamily.\nPhylogeny.\nThe following cladogram based on Piras et al. (2013) depicts the phylogeny of basal living and extinct groups.\nThe phylogenetic relationships of living felids are shown in the following cladogram:"}
{"id": "11303", "revid": "82432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11303", "title": "Folklore", "text": "Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people, culture or subculture. This includes oral traditions such as tales, myths, legends, proverbs, poems, jokes, and other oral traditions. This also includes material culture, such as traditional building styles common to the group. Folklore also encompasses customary lore, taking actions for folk beliefs, including folk religion, and the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas, weddings, folk dances, and initiation rites. \nEach one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact or traditional cultural expression. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. Folklore is not something one can typically gain from a formal school curriculum or study in the fine arts. Instead, these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another, either through verbal instruction or demonstration.\nThe academic study of folklore is called folklore studies or folkloristics, and it can be explored at the undergraduate, graduate, and Ph.D. levels.\nOverview.\nThe word \"folklore\", a compound of \"folk\" and \"lore\", was coined in 1846 by the Englishman William Thoms, who contrived the term as a replacement for the contemporary terminology of \"popular antiquities\" or \"popular literature\". The second half of the word, \"lore\", comes from Old English l\u0101r 'instruction'. It is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group frequently passed along by word of mouth.\nThe concept of \"folk\" has varied over time. When Thoms first created this term, \"folk\" applied only to rural, frequently poor, and illiterate peasants. A more modern definition of \"folk\" is a social group that includes two or more people with common traits who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions. \"Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in American folklore or to a single family.\" This expanded social definition of \"folk\" supports a broader view of the material, i.e., the lore, considered to be \"folklore artifacts\". These now include all \"things people make with words (verbal lore), things they make with their hands (material lore), and things they make with their actions (customary lore)\". Folklore are no longer considered to be limited to that which is old or obsolete. These folk artifacts continue to be passed along informally, as a rule anonymously, and always in multiple variants. The folk group is not individualistic; it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community. \"As new groups emerge, new folklore is created\u2026 surfers, motorcyclists, \". In direct contrast to high culture, where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law, folklore is a function of shared identity within a common social group.\nHaving identified folk artifacts, the professional folklorist strives to understand the \"significance\" of these beliefs, customs, and objects for the group, since these cultural units would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group. That meaning can, however, shift and morph; for example, the Halloween celebration of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages and even gives rise to its own set of urban legends independent of the historical celebration; the cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water, but now these customs signify for some people identification as an Orthodox Jew. By comparison, a common action such as tooth brushing, which is also transmitted within a group, remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition. Tradition is initially remembered behavior; once it loses its practical purpose, there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action. This meaning is at the core of folkloristics, the study of folklore.\nWith the increasing theoretical sophistication of the social sciences, it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group; it is indeed all around us. Folklore does not have to be old or antiquated; it continues to be created and transmitted, and in any group, it is used to differentiate between \"us\" and \"them.\"\nOrigin and development of folklore studies.\nFolklore began to distinguish itself as an autonomous discipline during the period of romantic nationalism in Europe. A particular figure in this development was Johann Gottfried von Herder, whose writings in the 1770s presented oral traditions as organic processes grounded in the locale. After the German states were invaded by Napoleonic France, Herder's approach was adopted by many of his fellow Germans, who systematized the recorded folk traditions and used them in their process of nation building. This process was enthusiastically embraced by smaller nations, like Finland, Estonia, and Hungary, which were seeking political independence from their dominant neighbors.\nFolklore, as a field of study, further developed among 19th-century European scholars, who were contrasting tradition with the newly developing modernity. Its focus was the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations, which were considered as residues and survivals of the past that continued to exist within the lower strata of society. The \"Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen\" of the Brothers Grimm (first published 1812) is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the European peasantry of that time. This interest in stories, sayings, and songs continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folkloristics with literature and mythology. By the turn of the 20th century, the number and sophistication of folklore studies and folklorists had grown both in Europe and North America. Whereas European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogenous peasant populations in their regions, the American folklorists, led by Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict, chose to consider Native American cultures in their research, and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore. This distinction aligned American folkloristics with cultural anthropology and ethnology, using the same techniques of data collection in their field research. This divided alliance of folkloristics between the humanities in Europe and the social sciences in America offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folkloristics as a whole, even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself.\nThe term \"folkloristics\", along with the alternative name \"folklore studies\", became widely used in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the folklore artifacts themselves. When the American Folklife Preservation Act (Public Law 94-201) was passed by the U.S. Congress in January 1976, to coincide with the Bicentennial Celebration, folkloristics in the United States came of age.\n\"\u2026[Folklife] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States: familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction.\" \nAdded to the extensive array of other legislation designed to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the United States, this law also marks a shift in national awareness. It gives voice to a growing understanding that cultural diversity is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection. Paradoxically, it is a unifying feature, not something that separates the citizens of a country. \"We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife, we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans\". This diversity is celebrated annually at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival and many other folklife fests around the country.\nThere are numerous other definitions. According to William Bascom major article on the topic, there are \"four functions to folklore\":\nDefinition of \"folk\".\nThe folk of the 19th century, the social group identified in the original term \"folklore\", was characterized by being rural, illiterate, and poor. They were the peasants living in the countryside, in contrast to the urban populace of the cities. Only toward the end of the century did the urban proletariat (on the coattails of Marxist theory) become included with the rural poor as folk. The common feature in this expanded definition of folk was their identification as the underclass of society.\nMoving forward into the 20th century, in tandem with new thinking in the social sciences, folklorists also revised and expanded their concept of the folk group. By the 1960s, it was understood that social groups, i.e., folk groups, were all around us; each individual is enmeshed in a multitude of differing identities and their concomitant social groups. The first group that each of us is born into is the family, and each family has its own unique family folklore. As a child grows into an individual, its identities also increase to include age, language, ethnicity, occupation, etc. Each of these cohorts has its own folklore, and as one folklorist points out, this is \"not idle speculation\u2026 Decades of fieldwork have demonstrated conclusively that these groups do have their own folklore.\" In this modern understanding, folklore is a function of shared identity within any social group.\nThis folklore can include jokes, sayings, and expected behavior in multiple variants, always transmitted in an informal manner. For the most part, it will be learned by observation, imitation, repetition, or correction by other group members. This informal knowledge is used to confirm and reinforce the identity of the group. It can be used both internally within the group to express their common identity, for example in an initiation ceremony for new members. It can also be used externally to differentiate the group from outsiders, like a folk dance demonstration at a community festival. Significant to folklorists here is that there are two opposing but equally valid ways to use this in the study of a group: you can start with an identified group in order to explore its folklore, or you can identify folklore items and use them to identify the social group.\nBeginning in the 1960s, a further expansion of the concept of folk began to unfold through the study of folklore. Individual researchers identified folk groups that had previously been overlooked and ignored. One notable example of this is found in an issue of the \"Journal of American Folklore\", published in 1975, which is dedicated exclusively to articles on women's folklore, with approaches that had not come from a man's perspective. Other groups that were highlighted as part of this broadened understanding of the folk group were non-traditional families, occupational groups, and families that pursued the production of folk items over multiple generations.\nFolklorist Richard Dorson explained in 1976 that the study of folklore is \"concerned with the study of traditional culture, or the unofficial culture\" that is the folk culture, \"as opposed to the elite culture, not for the sake of proving a thesis but to learn about the mass of [humanity] overlooked by the conventional disciplines.\"\nFolklore genres.\nIndividual folklore artifacts are commonly classified as one of three types: material, verbal or customary lore. For the most part self-explanatory, these categories include physical objects (material folklore), common sayings, expressions, stories and songs (verbal folklore), and beliefs and ways of doing things (customary folklore). There is also a fourth major subgenre defined for children's folklore and games (childlore), as the collection and interpretation of this fertile topic is particular to school yards and neighborhood streets. Each of these genres and their subtypes is intended to organize and categorize the folklore artifacts; they provide common vocabulary and consistent labeling for folklorists to communicate with each other.\nThat said, each artifact is unique; in fact, one of the characteristics of all folklore artifacts is their variation within genres and types. This is in direct contrast to manufactured goods, where the goal in production is to create identical products, and any variations are considered mistakes. It is, however, just this required variation that makes identification and classification of the defining features a challenge. While this classification is essential for the subject area of folkloristics, it remains just labeling and adds little to an understanding of the traditional development and meaning of the artifacts themselves.\nNecessary as they are, genre classifications are misleading in their oversimplification of the subject area. Folklore artifacts are never self-contained, they do not stand in isolation but are particulars in the self-representation of a community. Different genres are frequently combined with each other to mark an event. So a birthday celebration might include a song or formulaic way of greeting the birthday child (verbal), presentation of a cake and wrapped presents (material), as well as customs to honor the individual, such as sitting at the head of the table and blowing out the candles with a wish. There might also be special games played at birthday parties, which are not generally played at other times. Adding to the complexity of the interpretation, the birthday party for a seven-year-old will not be identical to the birthday party for that same child as a six-year-old, even though they follow the same model. For each artifact embodies a single variant of a performance in a given time and space. The task of the folklorist becomes to identify within this surfeit of variables the constants and the expressed meaning that shimmer through all variations: honoring of the individual within the circle of family and friends, gifting to express their value and worth to the group, and of course, the festival food and drink as signifiers of the event.\nVerbal tradition.\nThe formal definition of verbal lore is words, both written and oral, that are \"spoken, sung, voiced forms of traditional utterance that show repetitive patterns.\" Crucial here are the repetitive patterns. Verbal lore is not just any conversation, but words and phrases conforming to a traditional configuration recognized by both the speaker and the audience. For narrative types, by definition, they have a consistent structure and follow an existing model in their narrative form. As just one simple example, in English, the phrase \"An elephant walks into a bar\u2026\" instantaneously flags the following text as a joke. It might be one you have already heard, but it might be one that the speaker has just thought up within the current context. Another example is the child's song Old MacDonald Had a Farm, where each performance is distinctive in the animals named, their order, and their sounds. Songs such as this are used to express cultural values (farms are important, farmers are old and weather-beaten) and teach children about different domesticated animals.\nVerbal folklore was the original folklore, the artifacts defined by William Thoms as older, oral cultural traditions of the rural populace. In his 1846 published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of verbal lore. By the beginning of the 20th century, these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary. Antti Aarne published the first classification system for folktales in 1910. This was later expanded into the Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system by Stith Thompson and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified oral artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items that had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups, and epochs, giving rise to the Historic\u2013Geographic Method, a methodology that dominated folkloristics in the first half of the 20th century.\nWhen William Thoms first published his appeal to document the verbal lore of the rural populations, it was believed these folk artifacts would die out as the population became literate. Over the past two centuries, this belief has proven to be wrong; folklorists continue to collect verbal lore in both written and spoken form from all social groups. Some variants might have been captured in published collections, but much of it is still transmitted orally and, indeed, continues to be generated in new forms and variants at an alarming rate.\nBelow is listed a small sampling of types and examples of verbal lore.\nMaterial culture.\nThe genre of material culture includes all artifacts that can be touched, held, lived in, or eaten. They are tangible objects with a physical or mental presence, either intended for permanent use or to be used at the next meal. Most of these folklore artifacts are single objects that have been created by hand for a specific purpose; however, folk artifacts can also be mass-produced, such as dreidels or Christmas decorations. These items continue to be considered folklore because of their long (pre-industrial) history and their customary use. All of these material objects \"existed prior to and continue alongside mechanized industry. \u2026 [They are] transmitted across the generations and subject to the same forces of conservative tradition and individual variation\" that are found in all folk artifacts. Folklorists are interested in the physical form, the method of manufacture or construction, the pattern of use, as well as the procurement of the raw materials. The meaning to those who both make and use these objects is important. Of primary significance in these studies is the complex balance of continuity over change in both their design and their decoration.\nIn Europe, prior to the Industrial Revolution, everything was made by hand. While some folklorists of the 19th century wanted to secure the oral traditions of the rural folk before the populace became literate, other folklorists sought to identify hand-crafted objects before their production processes were lost to industrial manufacturing. Just as verbal lore continues to be actively created and transmitted in today's culture, so these handicrafts can still be found all around us, with possibly a shift in purpose and meaning. There are many reasons for continuing to handmake objects for use, for example these skills may be needed to repair manufactured items, or a unique design might be required which is not (or cannot be) found in the stores. Many crafts are considered as simple home maintenance, such as cooking, sewing and carpentry. For many people, handicrafts have also become an enjoyable and satisfying hobby. Handmade objects are often regarded as prestigious, where extra time and thought is spent in their creation and their uniqueness is valued. For the folklorist, these hand-crafted objects embody multifaceted relationships in the lives of the craftspeople and the users, a concept that has been lost with mass-produced items that have no connection to an individual craftsperson.\nMany traditional crafts, such as ironworking and glass-making, have been elevated to the fine or applied arts and taught in art schools; or they have been repurposed as folk art, characterized as objects whose decorative form supersedes their utilitarian needs. Folk art is found in hex signs on Pennsylvania Dutch barns, tin man sculptures made by metalworkers, front yard Christmas displays, decorated school lockers, carved gun stocks, and tattoos. \"Words such as naive, self-taught, and individualistic are used to describe these objects, and the exceptional rather than the representative creation is featured.\" This is in contrast to the understanding of folklore artifacts that are nurtured and passed along within a community.\nMany objects of material folklore are challenging to classify, difficult to archive, and unwieldy to store. The assigned task of museums is to preserve and make use of these bulky artifacts of material culture. To this end, the concept of the living museum has developed, beginning in Scandinavia at the end of the 19th century. These open-air museums not only display the artifacts, but also teach visitors how the items were used, with actors reenacting the everyday lives of people from all segments of society, relying heavily on the material artifacts of a pre-industrial society. Many locations even duplicate the processing of the objects, thus creating new objects of an earlier historic time period. Living museums are now found throughout the world as part of a thriving heritage industry.\nThis list represents just a small sampling of objects and skills that are included in studies of material culture.\nCustoms.\nCustomary culture is remembered enactment, i.e. re-enactment. It is the patterns of expected behavior within a group, the \"traditional and expected way of doing things\" A custom can be a single gesture, such as thumbs down or a handshake. It can also be a complex interaction of multiple folk customs and artifacts as seen in a child's birthday party, including verbal lore (Happy Birthday song), material lore (presents and a birthday cake), special games (Musical chairs) and individual customs (making a wish as you blow out the candles). Each of these is a folklore artifact in its own right, potentially worthy of investigation and cultural analysis. Together they combine to build the custom of a birthday party celebration, a scripted combination of multiple artifacts which have meaning within their social group.\nFolklorists divide customs into several different categories. A custom can be a seasonal celebration, such as Thanksgiving or New Year's. It can be a life cycle celebration for an individual, such as baptism, birthday or wedding. A custom can also mark a community festival or event; examples of this are Carnival in Cologne or Mardi Gras in New Orleans. This category also includes the Smithsonian Folklife Festival celebrated each summer on the Mall in Washington, DC. A fourth category includes customs related to folk beliefs. Walking under a ladder is just one of many symbols considered unlucky. Occupational groups tend to have a rich history of customs related to their life and work, so the traditions of sailors or lumberjacks. The area of ecclesiastical folklore, which includes modes of worship not sanctioned by the established church tends to be so large and complex that it is usually treated as a specialized area of folk customs; it requires considerable expertise in standard church ritual in order to adequately interpret folk customs and beliefs that originated in official church practice.\nCustomary folklore is always a performance, be it a single gesture or a complex of scripted customs, and participating in the custom, either as performer or audience, signifies acknowledgment of that social group. Some customary behavior is intended to be performed and understood only within the group itself, so the handkerchief code sometimes used in the gay community or the initiation rituals of the Freemasons. Other customs are designed specifically to represent a social group to outsiders, those who do not belong to this group. The St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York and in other communities across the continent is a single example of an ethnic group parading their separateness (differential behavior), and encouraging Americans of all stripes to show alliance to this colorful ethnic group.\nThese festivals and parades, with a target audience of people who do not belong to the social group, intersect with the interests and mission of public folklorists, who are engaged in the documentation, preservation, and presentation of traditional forms of folklife. With a swell in popular interest in folk traditions, these community celebrations are becoming more numerous throughout the western world. While ostensibly parading the diversity of their community, economic groups have discovered that these folk parades and festivals are good for business. All shades of people are out on the streets, eating, drinking and spending. This attracts support not only from the business community, but also from federal and state organizations for these local street parties. Paradoxically, in parading diversity within the community, these events have come to authenticate true community, where business interests ally with the varied (folk) social groups to promote the interests of the community as a whole.\nThis is just a small sampling of types and examples of customary lore.\nChildlore and games.\nChildlore is a distinct branch of folklore that deals with activities passed on by children to other children, away from the influence or supervision of an adult. Children's folklore contains artifacts from all the standard folklore genres of verbal, material, and customary lore; it is however the child-to-child conduit that distinguishes these artifacts. For childhood is a social group where children teach, learn and share their own traditions, flourishing in a street culture outside the purview of adults. This is also ideal where it needs to be collected; as Iona and Peter Opie demonstrated in their pioneering book \"Children's Games in Street and Playground\". Here the social group of children is studied on its own terms, not as a derivative of adult social groups. It is shown that the culture of children is quite distinctive; it is generally unnoticed by the sophisticated world of adults, and quite as little affected by it.\nOf particular interest to folklorists here is the mode of transmission of these artifacts; this lore circulates exclusively within an informal pre-literate children's network or folk group. It does not include artifacts taught to children by adults. However children can take the taught and teach it further to other children, turning it into childlore. Or they can take the artifacts and turn them into something else; so Old McDonald's farm is transformed from animal noises to the scatological version of animal poop. This childlore is characterized by \"its lack of dependence on literary and fixed form. Children\u2026operate among themselves in a world of informal and oral communication, unimpeded by the necessity of maintaining and transmitting information by written means\". This is as close as folklorists can come to observing the transmission and social function of this folk knowledge before the spread of literacy during the 19th century.\nAs we have seen with the other genres, the original collections of children's lore and games in the 19th century was driven by a fear that the culture of childhood would die out. Early folklorists, among them Alice Gomme in Britain and William Wells Newell in the United States, felt a need to capture the unstructured and unsupervised street life and activities of children before it was lost. This fear proved to be unfounded. In a comparison of any modern school playground during recess and the painting of \"Children's Games\" by Pieter Breugel the Elder we can see that the activity level is similar, and many of the games from the 1560 painting are recognizable and comparable to modern variations still played today.\nThese same artifacts of childlore, in innumerable variations, also continue to serve the same function of learning and practicing skills needed for growth. So bouncing and swinging rhythms and rhymes encourage development of balance and coordination in infants and children. Verbal rhymes like Peter Piper picked... serve to increase both the oral and aural acuity of children. Songs and chants, accessing a different part of the brain, are used to memorize series (Alphabet song). They also provide the necessary beat to complex physical rhythms and movements, be it hand-clapping, jump roping, or ball bouncing. Furthermore, many physical games are used to develop strength, coordination and endurance of the players. For some team games, negotiations about the rules can run on longer than the game itself as social skills are rehearsed. Even as we are just now uncovering the neuroscience that undergirds the developmental function of this childlore, the artifacts themselves have been in play for centuries.\nBelow is listed just a small sampling of types and examples of childlore and games.\nFolk history.\nA case has been made for considering folk history as a distinct sub-category of folklore, an idea that has received attention from such folklorists as Richard Dorson. This field of study is represented in \"The Folklore Historian\", an annual journal sponsored by the History and Folklore Section of the American Folklore Society and concerned with the connections of folklore with history, as well as the history of folklore studies.\nFolklore performance in context.\nLacking context, folklore artifacts would be uninspiring objects without any life of their own. It is only through performance that the artifacts come alive as an active and meaningful component of a social group; the intergroup communication arises in the performance and this is where transmission of these cultural elements takes place. American folklorist Roger D. Abrahams has described it thus: \"Folklore is folklore only when performed. As organized entities of performance, items of folklore have a sense of control inherent in them, a power that can be capitalized upon and enhanced through effective performance.\" Without transmission, these items are not folklore, they are just individual quirky tales and objects.\nThis understanding in folkloristics only occurred in the second half of the 20th century, when the two terms \"folklore performance\" and \"text and context\" dominated discussions among folklorists. These terms are not contradictory or even mutually exclusive. As borrowings from other fields of study, one or the other linguistic formulation is more appropriate to any given discussion. Performance is frequently tied to verbal and customary lore, whereas context is used in discussions of material lore. Both formulations offer different perspectives on the same folkloric understanding, specifically that folklore artifacts need to remain embedded in their cultural environment if we are to gain insight into their meaning for the community.\nThe concept of cultural (folklore) performance is shared with ethnography and anthropology among other social sciences. The cultural anthropologist Victor Turner identified four universal characteristics of cultural performance: playfulness, framing, the use of symbolic language, and employing the subjunctive mood. In viewing the performance, the audience leaves the daily reality to move into a mode of make-believe, or \"what if?\" It is self-evident that this fits well with all types of verbal lore, where reality has no place among the symbols, fantasies, and nonsense of traditional tales, proverbs, and jokes. Customs and the lore of children and games also fit easily into the language of a folklore performance.\nMaterial culture requires some moulding to turn it into a performance. Should we consider the performance of the creation of the artifact, as in a quilting party, or the performance of the recipients who use the quilt to cover their marriage bed? Here the language of context works better to describe the quilting of patterns copied from the grandmother, quilting as a social event during the winter months, or the gifting of a quilt to signify the importance of the event. Each of these\u2014the traditional pattern chosen, the social event, and the gifting\u2014occur within the broader context of the community. Even so, when considering context, the structure and characteristics of performance can be recognized, including an audience, a framing event, and the use of decorative figures and symbols, all of which go beyond the utility of the object.\nBackstory.\nBefore the Second World War, folk artifacts had been understood and collected as cultural shards of an earlier time. They were considered individual vestigial artifacts, with little or no function in the contemporary culture. Given this understanding, the goal of the folklorist was to capture and document them before they disappeared. They were collected with no supporting data, bound in books, archived and classified more or less successfully. The Historic\u2013Geographic Method worked to isolate and track these collected artifacts, mostly verbal lore, across space and time.\nFollowing the Second World War, folklorists began to articulate a more holistic approach toward their subject matter. In tandem with the growing sophistication in the social sciences, attention was no longer limited to the isolated artifact, but extended to include the artifact embedded in an active cultural environment. One early proponent was Alan Dundes with his essay \"Texture, Text and Context\", first published 1964. A public presentation in 1967 by Dan Ben-Amos at the American Folklore Society brought the behavioral approach into open debate among folklorists. In 1972 Richard Dorson called out the \"young Turks\" for their movement toward a behavioral approach to folklore. This approach \"shifted the conceptualization of folklore as an extractable item or 'text' to an emphasis on folklore as a kind of human behavior and communication. Conceptualizing folklore as behavior redefined the job of folklorists...\"\nFolklore became a verb, an action, something that people do, not just something that they have. It is in the performance and the active context that folklore artifacts get transmitted in informal, direct communication, either verbally or in demonstration. Performance includes all the different modes and manners in which this transmission occurs.\nTradition-bearer and audience.\nTransmission is a communicative process requiring a binary: one individual or group who actively transmits information in some form to another individual or group. Each of these is a defined role in the folklore process. The tradition-bearer is the individual who actively passes along the knowledge of an artifact; this can be either a mother singing a lullaby to her baby, or an Irish dance troupe performing at a local festival. They are named individuals, usually well known in the community as knowledgeable in their traditional lore. They are not the anonymous \"folk\", the nameless mass without of history or individuality.\nThe audience of this performance is the other half in the transmission process; they listen, watch, and remember. Few of them will become active tradition-bearers; many more will be passive tradition-bearers who maintain a memory of this specific traditional artifact, in both its presentation and its content.\nThere is active communication between the audience and the performer. The performer is presenting to the audience; the audience in turn, through its actions and reactions, is actively communicating with the performer. The purpose of this performance is not to create something new but to re-create something that already exists; the performance is words and actions which are known, recognized and valued by both the performer and the audience. For folklore is first and foremost remembered behavior. As members of the same cultural reference group, they identify and value this performance as a piece of shared cultural knowledge.\nFraming the performance.\nTo initiate the performance, there must be a frame of some sort to indicate that what is to follow is indeed performance. The frame brackets it as outside of normal discourse. In customary lore such as life cycle celebrations (ex. birthday) or dance performances, the framing occurs as part of the event, frequently marked by location. The audience goes to the event location to participate. Games are defined primarily by rules, it is with the initiation of the rules that the game is framed. The folklorist Barre Toelken describes an evening spent in a Navaho family playing string figure games, with each of the members shifting from performer to audience as they create and display different figures to each other.\nIn verbal lore, the performer will start and end with recognized linguistic formulas. An easy example is seen in the common introduction to a joke: \"Have you heard the one...\", \"Joke of the day...\", or \"An elephant walks into a bar\". Each of these signals to the listeners that the following is a joke, not to be taken literally. The joke is completed with the punch line of the joke. Another traditional narrative marker in English is the framing of a fairy tale between the phrases \"Once upon a time\" and \"They all lived happily ever after.\" Many languages have similar phrases which are used to frame a traditional tale. Each of these linguistic formulas removes the bracketed text from ordinary discourse, and marks it as a recognized form of stylized, formulaic communication for both the performer and the audience.\nIn the subjunctive voice.\nFraming as a narrative device serves to signal to both the story teller and the audience that the narrative which follows is indeed a fiction (verbal lore), and not to be understood as historical fact or reality. It moves the framed narration into the subjunctive mood, and marks a space in which \"fiction, history, story, tradition, art, teaching, all exist within the narrated or performed expressive 'event' outside the normal realms and constraints of reality or time.\" This shift from the realis to the irrealis mood is understood by all participants within the reference group. It enables these fictional events to contain meaning for the group, and can lead to very real consequences.\nAnderson's law of auto-correction.\nThe theory of self-correction in folklore transmission was first articulated by the folklorist Walter Anderson in the 1920s; this posits a feedback mechanism which would keep folklore variants closer to the original form. This theory addresses the question about how, with multiple performers and multiple audiences, the artifact maintains its identity across time and geography. Anderson credited the audience with censoring narrators who deviated too far from the known (traditional) text.\nAny performance is a two-way communication process. The performer addresses the audience with words and actions; the audience in turn actively responds to the performer. If this performance deviates too far from audience expectations of the familiar folk artifact, they will respond with negative feedback. Wanting to avoid more negative reaction, the performer will adjust his performance to conform to audience expectations. \"Social reward by an audience [is] a major factor in motivating narrators...\" It is this dynamic feedback loop between performer and audience which gives stability to the text of the performance.\nIn reality, this model is not so simplistic; there are multiple redundancies in the active folklore process. The performer has heard the tale multiple times, he has heard it from different story tellers in multiple versions. In turn, he tells the tale multiple times to the same or a different audience, and they expect to hear the version they know. This expanded model of redundancy in a non-linear narrative process makes it difficult to innovate during any single performance; corrective feedback from the audience will be immediate. \"At the heart of both autopoetic self-maintenance and the 'virality' of meme transmission... it is enough to assume that some sort of recursive action maintains a degree of integrity [of the artifact] in certain features ... sufficient to allow us to recognize it as an instance of its type.\"\nContext of material lore.\nFor material folk artifacts, it becomes more fruitful to return to the terminology of Alan Dundes: text and context. Here the text designates the physical artifact itself, the single item made by an individual for a specific purpose. The context is then unmasked by observation and questions concerning both its production and its usage. Why was it made, how was it made, who will use it, how will they use it, where did the raw materials come from, who designed it, etc. These questions are limited only by the skill of the interviewer.\nIn his study of southeastern Kentucky chair makers, Michael Owen Jones describes production of a chair within the context of the life of the craftsman. For Henry Glassie in his study of Folk Housing in Middle Virginia, the investigation concerns the historical pattern he finds repeated in the dwellings of this region: the house is planted in the landscape just as the landscape completes itself with the house. The artisan in his roadside stand or shop in the nearby town wants to make and display products which appeal to customers. There is \"a craftsperson's eagerness to produce 'satisfactory items' due to a close personal contact with the customer and expectations to serve the customer again.\" Here the role of consumer \"... is the basic force responsible for the continuity and discontinuity of behavior.\"\nIn material culture the context becomes the cultural environment in which the object is made (chair), used (house), and sold (wares). None of these artisans is \"anonymous\" folk; they are individuals making a living with the tools and skills learned within and valued in the context of their community.\nToelken's conservative-dynamic continuum.\nNo two performances are identical. The performer attempts to keep the performance within expectations, but this happens despite a multitude of changing variables. He has given this performance one time more or less, the audience is different, the social and political environment has changed. In the context of material culture, no two hand-crafted items are identical. Sometimes these deviations in the performance and the production are unintentional, just part of the process. But sometimes these deviations are intentional; the performer or artisan want to play with the boundaries of expectation and add their own creative touch. They perform within the tension of conserving the recognized form and adding innovation.\nThe folklorist Barre Toelken identifies this tension as \"a combination of both changing ('dynamic') and static ('conservative') elements that evolve and change through sharing, communication and performance.\" Over time, the cultural context shifts and morphs: new leaders, new technologies, new values, new awareness. As the context changes, so must the artifact, for without modifications to map existing artifacts into the evolving cultural landscape, they lose their meaning. Joking as an active form of verbal lore makes this tension visible as joke cycles come and go to reflect new issues of concern. Once an artifact is no longer applicable to the context, transmission becomes a nonstarter; it loses relevancy for a contemporary audience. If it is not transmitted, then it is no longer folklore and becomes instead an historic relic.\nIn the electronic age.\nFolklorists have begun to identify how the advent of electronic communications will modify and change the performance and transmission of folklore artifacts. It is clear that the internet is modifying folkloric process, not killing it, as despite the historic association between folklore and anti-modernity, people continue to use traditional expressive forms in new media, including the internet. Jokes and joking are as plentiful as ever both in traditional face-to-face interactions and through electronic transmission. New communication modes are also transforming traditional stories into many different configurations. The fairy tale Snow White is now offered in multiple media forms for both children and adults, including a television show and video game.\nYeh et al. (2023) suggest that user-generated content (UGC) should be considered as folklore, especially in mental health communities, because it conveys informal, unofficial knowledge through first-hand stories of treatment experiences. These narratives, often shared on YouTube, serve to educate and transmit culture, much like traditional folklore. They provide insight into mental health consumers' experiences with antidepressants, highlighting where they obtain information, gaps in their knowledge, and obstacles to seeking or continuing treatment. UGC in the form of YouTube reviews reflects dynamic, recurring expressions that function as a modern-day method of passing on informal knowledge."}
{"id": "11304", "revid": "1279007003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11304", "title": "Fusion cuisine", "text": "Fusion cuisine is a cuisine that combines elements of different culinary traditions that originate from different countries, regions, or cultures. Cuisines of this type are not categorized according to any one particular cuisine style and have played a part in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.\nThe term fusion cuisine, added to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 2002, is defined as \"a style of cookery which blends ingredients and methods of preparation from different countries, regions, or ethnic groups; food cooked in this style.\"\nCategories.\nFusion food is created by combining various cooking techniques from different cultures to produce a new type of cuisine. Although it is commonly invented by chefs, fusion cuisine can occur naturally. Cuisines which get fused can either come from a particular region (such as East Asian cuisine and European cuisine), sub-region (such as Southwestern American cuisine and New Mexican cuisine) or a country (such as Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine, Korean cuisine, French cuisine, Italian cuisine).\nAsian fusion restaurants which combine the various cuisines of different Asian countries have become popular in many parts of the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. Often featured are East Asian, Southeast Asian, and South Asian dishes alongside one another and offering dishes that are inspired combinations of such cuisines. California cuisine is considered a fusion culture, taking inspiration particularly from Italy, France, Mexico, the idea of the European delicatessen, and East Asia, and then creating traditional dishes from these cultures with non-traditional ingredients \u2013 such as California pizza. In Australia, due to immigration, fusion cuisine is being reinvented and is becoming increasingly the norm at numerous cafes and restaurants, with Asian-fusion restaurants like Tetsuya's in Sydney ranking highly in The World's 50 Best Restaurants.\nIn the United Kingdom, fish and chips can be seen as an early fusion dish due to its marrying of ingredients stemming from Jewish, French, and Belgian cuisines.\nFilipino cuisine is sometimes characterized as the \"original Asian fusion cuisine\", combining native culinary traditions and ingredients with the very different cuisines of China, Spain, Malaysia, Thailand and Mongolia, among others, due to its unique colonial history. Food in Malaysia (also Indonesia) is another example of fusion cuisine which blends Malay, Javanese, Chinese and Indian and light influences from Thai, Portuguese, Dutch, and British cuisines. Oceanic cuisine combines the different cuisines of the various island nations.\nTypes.\nAnother form of fusion food can be created by utilizing ingredients and flavors from one culture to create a unique twist on a dish from the different cultures. For example, a taco pizza is a type of pizza created using taco ingredients such as cheddar and pepper jack cheese, salsa, refried beans, and other common taco ingredients, fusing both Italian and Mexican cuisines.\nSimilar approaches have been used for fusion sushi, such as rolling maki with different types of rice and ingredients such as curry and basmati rice, cheese and salsa with Spanish rice, or spiced ground lamb and capers rolled with Greek-style rice and grape leaves, which resembles inside-out dolmades. Some fusion cuisines have themselves become accepted as a national cuisine, as with Peruvian Nikkei cuisine, which combines Japanese spices and seasonings and Peruvian ingredients like aj\u00ed with seafood. A quintessential Peruvian Nikkei dish is \"maki acevichado\" or \"ceviche roll\", consisting of ceviche with avocado rolled into maki.\nSaudi Arabia has been investing in resources to preserve their culture. In Jeddah, different cultures from Africa and Asia have used the combination of Saudi Arabia's spices to create new fusion foods found throughout the region and the country.\nHistory.\nFusion cuisine has existed for millennia as a form of cross-cultural exchange, though the term was only defined in the late 1900s. Mixtures of different cultures' cuisines have been adapted since the 16th century.\nColonialism.\nA lasting legacy of colonialism is fusion food. Colonial trade resulted in the exchange of ingredients, such as b\u00e1nh m\u00ec originating from French ingredients used in French Indochina, Jamaican patties combining the turnover with spices and peppers from the British Empire's possessions in Asia and Africa, and ramen originating as \"shina soba\" or \"Chinese noodle\" from the Empire of Japan's occupation of China's island territories in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Indigenous domestic servants were active participants in creating fusion foods by mixing ingredients and techniques.\nAlongside the creation of new dishes, colonialism also introduced class dimensions of food as cultural capital that modified consumption patterns. Indigenous practices of eating guinea pigs in Peru were banned and considered savage until recent movements to reclaim food practices, resulting in the erasure of much traditional knowledge in indigenous communities. These hierarchies are argued to be present in modern fusion food, which has been criticised for being portrayed as European cuisines 'elevating' other cuisines into modernity. Colonial debates also extend into discourse about the authenticity of foods such as the origins of Chicken tikka masala, and orientalist critiques of immigrant food being gentrified as \u2018ethnic\u2019 food.\nAdaptation to local palates.\nIn a climate of increasing globalization, where cultures and cuisines frequently cross-borders, cooking and food evolves to cater to the palates of the local communities, a phenomenon known as \"glocalization\", a portmanteau of \"localization\" and \"globalization\".\u201d Fusion cuisine is sometimes created by multinational restaurants, especially fast food chains. A primary example of this corporate globalized expansion is in the case of McDonald's regional menus which are adapted to \"reflect different tastes and local traditions for every country in which we have restaurants\". In addition to catering to the regional food traditions, McDonald's also takes an additional consideration for religious beliefs and laws, as seen in the absence of beef and pork items on Indian menus.\nBeyond accounting for the cultural or religious differences in cuisine, some fusion foods have also been created to fit the taste preferences of local communities when ethnic or cultural foods from abroad were introduced. A hallmark example of this adaptation is in the popular sushi roll, the California roll, which was created in America in the latter half of the 20th-century. A popular myth behind its composition containing crab, vegetables, and rice on the exterior cites the American aversion to foreign ingredients such as raw fish and seaweed.\nThese adjustments to foreign cuisines have both corporate and historical origins. In the example of McDonald's, the creation of regional menus can be seen as an economic choice to cater to the local palates and traditions. Another example of popularized fusion foods is the Korean stew \"budae-jjigae\", which was created by combining American ingredients of Spam, Vienna sausages, and sliced cheese, in a \"kimchi stew\" in the wake of the Korean War during which American tastes and influence were prevalent in Korea.\nRole of immigration.\nImmigrants play a significant role in shaping modern fusion cuisine.\u00a0 Food can often be a form of cultural expression that fosters a relationship with one's heritage, and fusion can emerge from creating foods from immigrant's adaptation of their own cultural food to the ingredients available in the host country or region. Immigrants may adapt the use of their cultural ingredients to local culinary traditions. For example, Vietnamese immigrants in the Southern United States used Vietnamese condiments in traditionally Creole cuisine, while adhering to Southern cooking methods. Similarly, the establishment of American Chinese cuisine has origins in Chinese-owned small businesses in American ghettos and Chinatowns, with many of these restaurants responsible for the adaptation of Chinese cuisine to American paletes.\nImmigrants may also adapt their cultural flavors to the availability of ingredients in the host country: Indian-Chinese cuisine shaped by Chinese immigrants to British-ruled India often uses Indian spice and flavor profiles such as garam masala and turmeric. As such, immigrant-founded fusion cuisines also play a role in shaping food culture in the host country by introducing new flavors and ingredients.\nIndian-Chinese cuisine is an example of how gradual migration and exchange across shared international borders contributes to fusion cuisine. Similar cases are Sino-Korean food emerging from Chinese diasporas in Korea and shared borders between Korea and Northeastern China, and Mexican-American cuisine influenced by Mexican immigration to the Southwest United States that combines Mexican, Native American, and European flavors. \u00a0\nThe convergence of two or more immigrant groups in a different host country can also lead to the emergence of fusion cuisines. Chinese and Latin American immigrants to the United States have collaboratively founded fusion restaurants, serving dishes such as Chinese dumplings filled with traditional slow-roasted pork from the Yucat\u00e0n Peninsula. In the United States, Asian fusion cuisine can constitute pan-Asian multi-ethnic ingredients such as rice, leading to a newfound form of \"American\" Asian food unfound in Asia. One popular example of pan-Asian fusion food found in North America is the rice bowl, often with ingredients commonly used together in Asia such as garlic with chili, stir-fried vegetables with tofu. This illustrates the dynamic process between fusion food and its relationship with intercultural solidarity, influenced by both local and other immigrant cultures.\nModern fusion food.\nJapanese cooking techniques were combined with French techniques in 1970s France to create nouvelle cuisine.\nWolfgang Puck is attributed as one of the pioneers of fusion cuisine, with some dispute. However, his restaurant \"Chinois on Main\" was named after the term attributed to Richard Wing, who in the 1960s combined French and Chinese cooking at the former Imperial Dynasty restaurant in Hanford, California.\nChef Norman Van Aken was the first person to use the term \"fusion cooking\" as he delivered a speech at a symposium in Santa Fe in 1988. Soon journalist Regina Schrambling wrote about Van Aken's work and the term spread around the globe. Norman Van Aken ended his speech by discussing the history of fusion cuisine, such as the use of coffee in Italian cuisine. Van Aken related this to coffee being used in different desserts such as Calabrian ricotta with chocolate mousse."}

Representing the state of a robot with traditional first-order logic requires the use of many axioms that simply imply that things in the environment do not change arbitrarily. For example, Hayes describes a \"block world\" with rules about stacking blocks together. In a first-order logic system, additional axioms are required to make inferences about the environment (for example, that a block cannot change position unless it is physically moved). The frame problem is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment.\nJohn McCarthy and Patrick J. Hayes defined this problem in their 1969 article, \"Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence\". In this paper, and many that came after, the formal mathematical problem was a starting point for more general discussions of the difficulty of knowledge representation for artificial intelligence. Issues such as how to provide rational default assumptions and what humans consider common sense in a virtual environment.\nIn philosophy, the frame problem became more broadly construed in connection with the problem of limiting the beliefs that have to be updated in response to actions. In the logical context, actions are typically specified by what they change, with the implicit assumption that everything else (the frame) remains unchanged.\nDescription.\nThe frame problem occurs even in very simple domains. A scenario with a door, which can be open or closed, and a light, which can be on or off, is statically represented by two propositions formula_1 and formula_2. If these conditions can change, they are better represented by two predicates formula_3 and formula_4 that depend on time; such predicates are called fluents. A domain in which the door is closed and the light off at time 0, and the door opened at time 1, can be directly represented in logic by the following formulae:\nThe first two formulae represent the initial situation; the third formula represents the effect of executing the action of opening the door at time 1. If such an action had preconditions, such as the door being unlocked, it would have been represented by formula_8. In practice, one would have a predicate formula_9 for specifying when an action is executed and a rule formula_10 for specifying the effects of actions. The article on the situation calculus gives more details.\nWhile the three formulae above are a direct expression in logic of what is known, they do not suffice to correctly draw consequences. While the following conditions (representing the expected situation) are consistent with the three formulae above, they are not the only ones.\nIndeed, another set of conditions that is consistent with the three formulae above is:\nThe frame problem is that specifying only which conditions are changed by the actions does not entail that all other conditions are not changed. This problem can be solved by adding the so-called \u201cframe axioms\u201d, which explicitly specify that all conditions not affected by actions are not changed while executing that action. For example, since the action executed at time 0 is that of opening the door, a frame axiom would state that the status of the light does not change from time 0 to time 1:\nThe frame problem is that one such frame axiom is necessary for every pair of action and condition such that the action does not affect the condition. In other words, the problem is that of formalizing a dynamical domain without explicitly specifying the frame axioms.\nThe solution proposed by McCarthy to solve this problem involves assuming that a minimal amount of condition changes have occurred; this solution is formalized using the framework of circumscription. The Yale shooting problem, however, shows that this solution is not always correct. Alternative solutions were then proposed, involving predicate completion, fluent occlusion, successor state axioms, etc.; they are explained below. By the end of the 1980s, the frame problem as defined by McCarthy and Hayes was solved. Even after that, however, the term \u201cframe problem\u201d was still used, in part to refer to the same problem but under different settings (e.g., concurrent actions), and in part to refer to the general problem of representing and reasoning with dynamical domains.\nSolutions.\nThe following solutions depict how the frame problem is solved in various formalisms. The formalisms themselves are not presented in full: what is presented are simplified versions that are sufficient to explain the full solution.\nFluent occlusion solution.\nThis solution was proposed by Erik Sandewall, who also defined a formal language for the specification of dynamical domains; therefore, such a domain can be first expressed in this language and then automatically translated into logic. In this article, only the expression in logic is shown, and only in the simplified language with no action names.\nThe rationale of this solution is to represent not only the value of conditions over time, but also whether they can be affected by the last executed action. The latter is represented by another condition, called occlusion. A condition is said to be \"occluded\" in a given time point if an action has been just executed that makes the condition true or false as an effect. Occlusion can be viewed as \u201cpermission to change\u201d: if a condition is occluded, it is relieved from obeying the constraint of inertia.\nIn the simplified example of the door and the light, occlusion can be formalized by two predicates formula_12 and formula_13. The rationale is that a condition can change value only if the corresponding occlusion predicate is true at the next time point. In turn, the occlusion predicate is true only when an action affecting the condition is executed.\nIn general, every action making a condition true or false also makes the corresponding occlusion predicate true. In this case, formula_19 is true, making the antecedent of the fourth formula above false for formula_20; therefore, the constraint that formula_21 does not hold for formula_20. Therefore, formula_1 can change value, which is also what is enforced by the third formula.\nIn order for this condition to work, occlusion predicates have to be true only when they are made true as an effect of an action. This can be achieved either by circumscription or by predicate completion. It is worth noticing that occlusion does not necessarily imply a change: for example, executing the action of opening the door when it was already open (in the formalization above) makes the predicate formula_24 true and makes formula_1 true; however, formula_1 has not changed value, as it was true already.\nPredicate completion solution.\nThis encoding is similar to the fluent occlusion solution, but the additional predicates denote change, not permission to change. For example, formula_27 represents the fact that the predicate formula_1 will change from time formula_29 to formula_30. As a result, a predicate changes if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true. An action results in a change if and only if it makes true a condition that was previously false or vice versa.\nThe third formula is a different way of saying that opening the door causes the door to be opened. Precisely, it states that opening the door changes the state of the door if it had been previously closed. The last two conditions state that a condition changes value at time formula_29 if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true at time formula_29. To complete the solution, the time points in which the change predicates are true have to be as few as possible, and this can be done by applying predicate completion to the rules specifying the effects of actions.\nSuccessor state axioms solution.\nThe value of a condition after the execution of an action can be determined by\nthe fact that the condition is true if and only if:\nA successor state axiom is a formalization in logic of these two facts. For\nexample, if formula_38 and formula_39 are two\nconditions used to denote that the action executed at time formula_29 was\nto open or close the door, respectively, the running example is encoded as\nfollows.\nThis solution is centered around the value of conditions, rather than the\neffects of actions. In other words, there is an axiom for every condition,\nrather than a formula for every action. Preconditions to actions (which are not\npresent in this example) are formalized by other formulae. The successor state\naxioms are used in the variant to the situation calculus proposed by\nRay Reiter.\nFluent calculus solution.\nThe fluent calculus is a variant of the situation calculus. It solves the frame problem by using first-order logic terms, rather than predicates, to represent the states. Converting predicates into terms in first-order logic is called reification; the fluent calculus can be seen as a logic in which predicates representing the state of conditions are reified.\nThe difference between a predicate and a term in first-order logic is that a term is a representation of an object (possibly a complex object composed of other objects), while a predicate represents a condition that can be true or false when evaluated over a given set of terms.\nIn the fluent calculus, each possible state is represented by a term obtained by composition of other terms, each one representing the conditions that are true in state. For example, the state in which the door is open and the light is on is represented by the term formula_45. It is important to notice that a term is not true or false by itself, as it is an object and not a condition. In other words, the term formula_45 represent a possible state, and does not by itself mean that this is the current state. A separate condition can be stated to specify that this is actually the state at a given time, e.g., formula_47 means that this is the state at time formula_48.\nThe solution to the frame problem given in the fluent calculus is to specify the effects of actions by stating how a term representing the state changes when the action is executed. For example, the action of opening the door at time 0 is represented by the formula:\nThe action of closing the door, which makes a condition false instead of true, is represented in a slightly different way:\nThis formula works provided that suitable axioms are given about formula_51 and formula_52, e.g., a term containing the same condition twice is not a valid state (for example, formula_53 is always false for every formula_54 and formula_29).\nEvent calculus solution.\nThe event calculus uses terms for representing fluents, like the fluent calculus, but also has one or more axioms constraining the value of fluents, like the successor state axioms. There are many variants of the event calculus, but one of the simplest and most useful employs a single axiom to represent the law of inertia:\nThe axiom states that a fluent formula_59 holds at a time formula_60, if an event formula_61 happens and initiates formula_59 at an earlier time formula_63, and there is no event formula_64 that happens and terminates formula_59 after or at the same time as formula_63 and before formula_60.\nTo apply the event calculus to a particular problem domain, it is necessary to define the formula_68 and formula_69 predicates for that domain. For example:\nTo apply the event calculus to a particular problem in the domain, it is necessary to specify the events that happen in the context of the problem. For example:\nTo solve a problem, such as \"which fluents hold at time 5?\", it is necessary to pose the problem as a goal, such as:\nIn this case, obtaining the unique solution:\nThe event calculus solves the frame problem, eliminating undesired solutions, by using a non-monotonic logic, such as first-order logic with circumscription or by treating the event calculus as a logic program using negation as failure.\nDefault logic solution.\nThe frame problem can be thought of as the problem of formalizing the principle that, by default, \"everything is presumed to remain in the state in which it is\" (Leibniz, \"An Introduction to a Secret Encyclop\u00e6dia\", \"c\". 1679). This default, sometimes called the \"commonsense law of inertia\", was expressed by Raymond Reiter in default logic:\n(if formula_79 is true in situation formula_54, and it can be assumed that formula_79 remains true after executing action formula_82, then we can conclude that formula_79 remains true).\nSteve Hanks and Drew McDermott argued, on the basis of their Yale shooting example, that this solution to the frame problem is unsatisfactory. Hudson Turner showed, however, that it works correctly in the presence of appropriate additional postulates.\nAnswer set programming solution.\nThe counterpart of the default logic solution in the language of answer set programming is a rule with strong negation:\n(if formula_85 is true at time formula_86, and it can be assumed that formula_85 remains true at time formula_88, then we can conclude that formula_85 remains true).\nSeparation logic solution.\nSeparation logic is a formalism for reasoning about computer programs using pre/post specifications of the form formula_90. Separation logic is an extension of Hoare logic oriented to reasoning about mutable data structures in computer memory and other dynamic resources, and it has a special connective *, pronounced \"and separately\", to support independent reasoning about disjoint memory regions.\nSeparation logic employs a \"tight\" interpretation of pre/post specs, which say that the code can \"only\" access memory locations guaranteed to exist by the precondition. This leads to the soundness of the most important inference rule of the logic, the \"frame rule\"\nformula_91\nThe frame rule allows descriptions of arbitrary memory outside the footprint (memory accessed) of the code to be added to a specification: this enables the initial specification to concentrate only on the footprint. For example, the inference\nformula_92\ncaptures that code which sorts a list \"x\" does not unsort a separate list \"y,\" and it does this without mentioning \"y\" at all in the initial spec above the line.\nAutomation of the frame rule has led to significant increases in the scalability of automated reasoning techniques for code, eventually deployed industrially to codebases with tens of millions of lines.\nThere appears to be some similarity between the separation logic solution to the frame problem and that of the fluent calculus mentioned above.\nAction description languages.\nAction description languages elude the frame problem rather than solving it. An action description language is a formal language with a syntax that is specific for describing situations and actions. For example, that the action formula_93 makes the door open if not locked is expressed by:\nThe semantics of an action description language depends on what the language can express (concurrent actions, delayed effects, etc.) and is usually based on transition systems.\nSince domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in logic, the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an action description logic is to be translated into logic. Typically, however, a translation is given from these languages to answer set programming rather than first-order logic."}

Although his parents were poor, they managed to send him to school in Tampere. At school Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 was a good student and with aid from his benefactor Henrik Liljeroos he entered the University of Helsinki in 1908 to study medicine. His acquaintances at university included the painters Eero J\u00e4rnefelt and Pekka Halonen, composer Jean Sibelius and author Juhani Aho.\nCareer.\nIn 1913 Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 moved from Helsinki to his old home village and devoted himself to writing. In 1914 Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 wrote articles for the newspaper \"Uusi Suometar\". In 1916 Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 married Sigrid Maria Salom\u00e4ki, whom he had met in 1914.\nBy principle, Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 was against all forms of violence and believed in scientific optimism. In his work he portrayed rural people as living united with the land.\nThe novel \"Hurskas kurjuus\" (Meek Heritage) (1919) depicted the reasons for Finnish Civil War and was controversial at the time due to its objective approach.\nSillanp\u00e4\u00e4 won international fame for his novel \"Nuorena nukkunut\" (translated to English as \"The Maid Silja\") in 1931.\nIn 1939, Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his deep understanding of his country's peasantry and the exquisite art with which he has portrayed their way of life and their relationship with Nature.\" A few days after he received the prize, talks between Finland and Soviet Union broke down and the Winter War began. Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 traveled to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize and donated the golden medal to be melted for funds to aid the war effort.\nBefore the Winter War, Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 wrote the lyrics for \"Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4n marssilaulu\" to lift his spirits when his eldest son Esko was partaking in military practices at Karelian Isthmus.\nIn 1939, Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4's wife Sigrid died of pneumonia leaving him with eight children.

The series is set in England just before, during, and after World War I.\nThe novel \"Flambards\" (book one) features a teenage orphan and heiress Christina Parsons, who comes to live at Flambards, the impoverished Essex estate owned by her crippled and tyrannical uncle, William Russell, and his two sons, Mark and Will.\nNovel summary.\nChristina Parsons, who has been shunted around the family since she was orphaned at the age of five years in 1901, is sent to live at Flambards with her mother's half-brother, the crippled Russell. Her Aunt Grace speculates that Russell plans for Christina to marry his son Mark to restore Flambards to its former glory using the money that she will inherit on her twenty-first birthday. Mark is as brutish as his father, with a great love for hunting, whereas the younger son William is terrified of horses after a hunting accident and aspires to be an aviator.

{"id": "11313", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11313", "title": "Father Ted", "text": "Father Ted is a sitcom created by Irish writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews and produced by British production company Hat Trick Productions for British television channel Channel 4. It aired over three series from 21 April 1995 until 1 May 1998, including a Christmas special, for a total of 25 episodes. It aired on Nine Network (series 1) and ABC Television (series 2 and 3) in Australia, and on TV2 in New Zealand.\nSet on the fictional Craggy Island, a remote location off Ireland's west coast, \"Father Ted\" stars Dermot Morgan as Father Ted Crilly, alongside fellow priests Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O'Hanlon) and Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly). Dishonourably exiled on the island by Bishop Leonard Brennan (Jim Norton) for various reasons, the priests live together in the parochial house with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle (Pauline McLynn). The show subverts parodies of low-brow humour as it portrays nuanced themes of loneliness, agnosticism, existentialism and purgatory experienced by its title character; this deeper meaning of the show has been much acclaimed.\n\"Father Ted\" won several British Academy Television Awards\u2014including twice for Best Comedy Series, and remains a popular sitcom in Ireland and the UK. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll, Dougal was ranked fifth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2019, \"Father Ted\" was named the second-greatest British sitcom (after \"Fawlty Towers)\" by a panel of comedy experts for \"Radio Times\".\nSynopsis.\nThe show follows the misadventures of three Irish Roman Catholic priests who live in a parish on the fictional Craggy Island, located off the west coast of Ireland. Father Ted Crilly, Father Dougal McGuire and Father Jack Hackett live chaotically together in Craggy Island's parochial house, along with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle, who always wants to serve them tea.\nThe three priests answer to Bishop Len Brennan, who has banished them to Craggy Island as punishment for different incidents in their past: Ted for alleged financial impropriety (apparently involving some money \"resting\" in his account and a child being deprived of a visit to Lourdes so that Ted could go to Las Vegas), Dougal for an event only referred to as the \"Blackrock Incident\" (resulting in \"many nuns' lives [being] irreparably damaged\"), and Jack for his alcoholism and womanising, particularly for an unspecified incident at a wedding in Athlone.\nThe show revolves around the priests' lives on Craggy Island, sometimes dealing with matters of the church but more often dealing with Father Ted's schemes to either resolve a situation with the parish or other Craggy Island residents, or to win games of one-upmanship against his enemy, Father Dick Byrne of the nearby Rugged Island parish.\nProduction.\nWriting.\nLinehan and Mathews first met while working at \"Hot Press\". In the late 1980s, Mathews, Paul Woodfull and Kieran Woodfull formed The Joshua Trio, a U2 tribute band. The trio began writing comedy sketches to accompany their act. Mathews created the Father Ted character for his short-lived stand-up routine. Before The Joshua Trio played at gigs, Mathews would occasionally come on-stage as Father Ted and tell jokes involving his great friend, Father Dougal McGuire.\nIn 1991, Mathews left his job at \"Hot Press\" and moved into Linehan's London home. Over the next three to four years, they worked on rough ideas for shows while at the same time writing for sketch shows such as \"The All New Alexei Sayle Show\" and \"The Fast Show\". One of these ideas was for a comedy mockumentary series called \"Irish Lives\", with six episodes, each focusing on a different character living somewhere in Ireland. They scripted an episode centring on a priest named Father Ted Crilly, who visits his friends in the seminary in Maynooth College. Producer Geoffrey Perkins suggested that the episode's concept be dramatised and rewritten as a sitcom.\nIn the January 1994 issue of \"In Dublin\" (Vol 19, No2), Mathews and Linehan told Damian Corless, who had initially introduced the pair to each other, of their work in progress, describing Ted as \"basically a nice man\", Dougal as \"nice but really stupid\" and Jack as \"a hideous creature\". Linehan revealed: \"They've all been sent to this isolated place called Craggy Island because they're crap priests.\" Mathews elaborated: \"They've each a terrible secret which is why they've been banished to this place, and the terrible thing is that they can't get away from each other. Obviously it's not entirely reality-based.\" Mathews was originally intended to play Ted, but decided he lacked the acting ability the role required. Maurice O'Donoghue, who plays Father Dick in the series, was their second choice for the role of Ted, being the right age and having a similar look and lightness. Mathews always preferred Dermot Morgan; Linehan was initially reluctant, worrying that some viewers would be confused because they already knew him as \"Father Trendy\", another priest character that he had played many years before on the RT\u00c9 television show \"The Live Mike\". Morgan was very excited about the Father Ted role, and he repeatedly phoned the series creators and let them know how much he wanted it, which eventually won Linehan over because he figured that if Dermot wanted the role so badly then he would end up putting a lot of passion into doing a great job with it.\nThe show was pitched directly to the UK's Hat Trick Productions and Channel 4 by the duo, contrary to rumours that RT\u00c9 (the Irish national broadcaster) were originally offered the series but rejected it.\nRecording.\nThree series and one Christmas special were aired. Declan Lowney directed the first two series and the Christmas special, while the third series was directed by Linehan (location scenes) and Andy De Emmony (studio scenes). In addition, Morgan and O'Hanlon hosted an hour of Comic Relief in character, during which Kelly and McLynn also made brief guest appearances. One day after the shooting of series three wrapped, Dermot Morgan died of a heart attack, aged 45. As a mark of respect, the third series was first broadcast a week later than originally planned.\nThe show was already scheduled to conclude with the third series prior to Morgan's death, as Morgan said that he did not want to continue playing the role of Father Ted for fear of being typecast: \"I don't want to be the next Clive Dunn and end up playing the same character for years.\"\nFollowing Morgan's death, the production company received calls from numerous agents and casting directors suggesting either new actors for the role of Ted or spin-offs without the character; Linehan and Mathews declined all offers.\nMusic.\nIn 1994, the writers asked alternative rock band Pulp to compose the theme music for \"Father Ted\", requesting a parody of a typical sitcom theme. When Pulp said no, they contacted Neil Hannon, frontman of Northern Irish chamber pop band The Divine Comedy. Hannon's first effort, a jaunty composition, was rejected on Geoffrey Perkins's advice. Hannon composed a second theme, which the team found acceptable. This theme was recorded by Hannon and co-producer Darren Allison at The Jesus and Mary Chain's private studio. One of William Reid's guitars was selected by Allison and Hannon to carry the main tune, which was played by Hannon. Both themes were also reworked, with new lyrics, for inclusion on The Divine Comedy's 1996 album \"Casanova\": the final \"Father Ted\" theme became \"Songs of Love\", while Hannon's rejected theme became \"A Woman of the World\".\nIn 2010, Linehan discussed the dramatic effect this choice had on the tone of the series: \"'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [Hannon] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and 'Songs of Love', and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [Perkins] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned.\"\nThe Divine Comedy also contributed most of the show's original music, including the songs \"Big Men in Frocks\" (for the episode \"Rock-a-Hula Ted\"), \"My Lovely Horse\" and \"The Miracle is Mine\" (for \"A Song for Europe\"), and \"My Lovely Mayo Mammy\" (for \"Night of the Nearly Dead\"). Neil Hannon also provided Ted and Dougal's vocals in the dream sequence version of \"My Lovely Horse\", which was produced by Allison and Hannon, and later appeared as a B-side on the band's single \"Gin Soaked Boy\".\nLocation.\nThe interior scenes were recorded at the London Studios in front of a live studio audience, while exterior filming was at various locations in Ireland. Location work for \"Father Ted\" was done mostly in County Clare, including locations at Corofin, Ennis, Kilfenora, Ennistymon, and Kilnaboy. The Parochial House is McCormack's at Glenquin, on the Boston road from Kilnaboy. The cinema featured in \"The Passion of St Tibulus\" was the Ormonde Cinema, Greystones, County Wicklow and \"The Field\", the location for Funland in \"'Good Luck, Father Ted'\", is in Portrane, North County Dublin. The 'Very Dark Caves' featured in \"The Mainland\" were the Aillwee caves in the Burren, County Clare.\nSome exterior shots for the episode \"And God Created Woman\" were filmed in D\u00fan Laoghaire, South County Dublin. The opening sequence (including shots of the \"Plassy\" shipwreck) were filmed over Inisheer \u2014 the smallest of the Aran Islands.\nComedic style.\nThe series is set in a humorously surreal world in which Ted is the only fully rounded normal character among \"caricatures\", according to Graham Linehan: \"exaggerated-over-friendly, over-quiet, over-stupid, over-dull [...] they really only got one thing, they've got one job.\"\nEmbarrassment plays a role in many storylines, in a similar fashion to \"Fawlty Towers\". Linehan says, \"if Ted is in a situation that is slightly embarrassing we get him out of it [...] by having him lying or cheating, basically digging a massive hole for himself\". Arthur Mathews has described \"Seinfeld\" as a major influence on the comedy of \"Father Ted\", with himself and Linehan being \"big fans\" of the show. \"Father Ted\" also contains references to pop culture, and some film parodies, such as the episode \"Speed 3\". An avid fan of Monty Python growing up, Linehan cited the ineffectual protest of \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" upon its release in 1979 as an influence for the \"Father Ted\" episode \"The Passion of Saint Tibulus\".\nRegarding the series's religious content, Linehan says \"Ted doesn't have an anti-religious view of life, but a non-religious view. It's a job to him. He doesn't care about religion.\" While writing, he says the show's creators imagined Ted and Dougal as \"just two people who happen to be [priests]\".\nReception.\n\"Father Ted\" was met with critical acclaim and is the most popular sitcom in Irish TV history. The Irish media frequently uses the series as a point of comparison in political stories.\nIn 1996 and 1999, the show won the BAFTA award for Best Comedy, while Morgan also won Best Comedy Performance. In 1995 the show won Best New TV Comedy at the British Comedy Awards, with O'Hanlon receiving Top TV Comedy Newcomer Award. At the 1996 British Comedy Awards the show won Top Channel 4 Sitcom Award, McLynn took the Top TV Comedy Actress award. In 1997 the show was given the Best Channel 4 Sitcom Award. It was also ranked at number 50 in the BFI's 2000 list of the 100 greatest British television programmes of the 20th century, the highest ranking Channel 4 production on the list. In 2004, it came 11th in the poll for Britain's Best Sitcom. In August 2012, Channel 4 viewers voted the series as the No 1 in \"C4's 30 Greatest Comedy Shows\".\nNotable fans of the show include director Steven Spielberg, musicians Liam Gallagher, Madonna, Cher and Moby, actors Jim Carrey and Steve Martin, comedian Ricky Gervais, and wrestler Sheamus. Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees was buried with a copy of the DVD box set. Singer-songwriter Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor was a fan, and attended the recording of the Christmas special. Irish musician Bono also requested to appear in the series.\nIn January 2007, a dispute arose between Inisheer and Inishmore over which island can claim to be Craggy Island, and thereby host a three-day Friends of Ted Festival. The dispute was settled by a five-a-side football match that February. Inishmore won 2\u20130 allowing them to use the title of Craggy Island until February 2008, while Inisheer was given the title of Rugged Island. The Friends of Ted Festival, better known as Ted Fest, has been held annually as a \"Father Ted\" fan convention since 2007.\nIn August 2020 An Post released a set of commemorative postage stamps, each with a catchphrase from the series on a background of the parochial house's lurid wallpaper, in a booklet listing Mrs Doyle's guesses for the name of Father Todd Unctious.\nSeveral quotes from the series have entered the popular lexicon, such as: \"These are \"small\", but the ones out there are \"far away\". Small. Far away.\", \"Down with this sort of thing\", \"Careful now\", \"That would be an ecumenical matter\" and \"I hear you're a racist now, Father\".\nDerivatives.\nOn 1 January 2011, Channel 4 dedicated a night of programmes to celebrate the show's 15th anniversary year. This included \"Father Ted: Unintelligent Design\", a documentary on the show's influences, and \"Small, Far Away: The World of Father Ted\", a documentary revisiting the show's history with the writers and many of the surviving cast (Pauline McLynn was unable to take part as she was working in another country).\nRoles reprised.\nIn 2001, Pauline McLynn reprised her role as Mrs Doyle in a run of advertisements for the UK's Inland Revenue, reminding people to get their taxes in on time with her catchphrase from the programme (\"Go on, go on, go on...\"). It was voted in an Adwatch poll of 1,000 people as the year's worst advertisement.\nLater in 2001, Ardal O'Hanlon returned to the role of Father Dougal for a series of PBS advertisements to coincide with \"Father Ted\"s American broadcast; these segments were included on later DVD releases as \"Fundraising with Father Dougal\".\nIn 2012, Frank Kelly made a brief appearance as Father Jack on an episode of \"The One Show\" with Graham Norton.\nIn 2014, guest star Ben Keaton returned to the role of Father Austin Purcell, performing a stand-up routine and hosting the pub quiz \"Arse Biscuits\" in-character. In 2015, he launched the spin-off web series \"Cook Like a Priest\".\nIn February 2016, Over The Top Wrestling marked the anniversary of Morgan's death with \"Ah Ted\", an event held in Dublin's Tivoli Variety Theatre. During the main-event tag-team match between The Lads From the Flats and The Kings of the North, Patrick McDonnell, Joe Rooney and Michael Redmond reprised their roles as Eoin McLove, Father Damo Lennon and Father Paul Stone respectively. McLove entered the ring first, withstanding one wrestler's attack on his crotch because he has \"no willy\", but was soon attacked by Father Damo, who brought the whistle he stole from Benson. Father Stone served as a special guest referee, performing a three-count so slow that one wrestler kicked out after two. In 2017, Rooney appeared as Father Damo in the video for Brave Giant's \"The Time I Met the Devil\", which follows him on the way to give Mass after a night of alcohol and sex.\nPotential remakes.\nSince the end of the series, several attempts to remake \"Father Ted\" have been reported, but none has yet materialised.\nIn July 2003, it was announced that the show would be remade for the American market. The remake would be scripted by Spike Feresten, who previously wrote for US sitcoms \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Simpsons\". Ferensten stated: \"I was raised Catholic and this show just felt right to me. The essence of the show is about men who are also priests and, as men, they have many foibles.\" Hat Trick founders Denise O'Donoghue and Jimmy Mulville were set to produce. The US production company was Pariah Productions, which previously adapted \"The Kumars at No. 42\" for an American audience.\nIn March 2004, Supanet Limited reported that an American remake was in development. This version would be set on a fictional island off the coast of New York. Steve Martin and Graham Norton would reportedly play Ted and Dougal. Martin had not been expected to take the role because of his stature, but agreed because he was a fan of the original series, and would reportedly be paid \u00a3500,000 per episode. Norton was cast based on his popularity with American audiences, and in reference to his appearance as Father Noel Furlong in the original series.\nIn November 2007, a separate American remake was announced. Rather than Craggy Island, this version would be set in an unfortunate fishing village in New England. American actor John Michael Higgins was cast as Ted, but expressed concerns about the show's religious themes: \"The English have a very robust history of being unkind about religion. We don't have that in our country, we're frightened of it. It's basically that you guys are doing an Irish joke also, we don't have that. So I'll be Father Ted, we'll see how it goes.\" Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2008.\nIn January 2015, Linehan said that there had been \"a few attempts\" by US broadcasters to remake the show, including one which would have been set in Boston \u2013 an idea Linehan considered \"ridiculous\".\nMusical.\nIn an interview with \"Radio Times\" in January 2015, Linehan said that he wanted to revive \"Father Ted\" as a musical stage production. He stated that he would never revive the television series, \"because of the risk you poison people's memories of the original\", but that the completely new format would make the project worthwhile. He mentioned the possibility of a dance number with \"spinning cardinals\". He said that the musical would have to reference the Catholic child abuse scandals, saying, \"The jokes would have to have a little bit more edge, because you just can't ignore this stuff.\" Mathews was \"not as convinced\" of the musical idea, though Linehan insisted it could work.\nIn December, Mathews said that he and Paul Woodfull were developing a Joshua Trio musical and a show focusing on a \"Father Michael Cleary-type character\", and that the \"Father Ted\" musical may follow. He expressed concerns that it would \"dilute the product\" or be seen as a \"cash-in\", but said that he believed there was an audience for the project. In April 2017, Linehan said that the musical would draw inspiration from \"The Book of Mormon\", and would \"go for the jugular ... You get all the things people loved about it, all the innocence and all the sweetness, but introduce a harder edge.\" Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would need to focus on a \"world-shaking\" story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to \"some weird succession thing\".\nIn June 2018, Linehan announced that \"Pope Ted: The Father Ted Musical\" was nearing completion, with a script by Linehan and Mathews. Linehan said, \"It's the real final episode of \"Father Ted ...\" This was the right idea. Arthur and I have been laughing our arses off while writing it. Just like the old days.\" The Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, who wrote the television show's music, composed the music.\nIn March 2022, Linehan said the musical had been cancelled by producers following the controversy over his public statements about transgender rights. He said that the musical was \"ready to go\", with a completed story and songs, but \"just because a group of people have decided that anybody who speaks up against this ideology is evil, [the producers have] just kind of rolled over for those people. No one is standing up for me.\" Hannon, a longtime friend of Linehan's, said the project was difficult and said about the controversy around Linehan: \"It's been difficult to watch what's happened. I believe in free speech, but I also very much believe in people's perfect right to remain completely silent on issues that they don't feel they can speak on. And that's all I want to say about it.\"\nIn December 2020, Linehan said he was seeking legal advice regarding Hat Trick Productions who he argued were preventing the musical from going into production owing to \"activists\" within the company."}
{"id": "11314", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11314", "title": "Foster's Lager", "text": "Foster's Lager is an internationally distributed brand of Australian lager. It is owned by the Japanese brewing group Asahi Group Holdings, and is brewed under licence in a number of countries, including its biggest market, the UK, where the European rights to the brand are owned by Heineken International.\nWhile Foster's is the largest-selling Australian beer brand in the world, it is not as popular and relatively rare compared with other beers in Australia, particularly when compared to current Carlton &amp; United Breweries beers such as Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught.\nHistory.\nFoster's was created by two American brothers, William M. and Ralph R. Foster, who arrived in Melbourne from New York in 1886. The brothers began brewing Foster's Lager in November 1888. It was made available to the public from February 1889. The product was first exported in 1901, when bottles were sent to Australian combatants in the Boer War.\nIn 1907, the company merged with five other brewing companies to form Carlton &amp; United Breweries (CUB). Then only available in bottles, Foster's Lager was considered to be CUB's premium brand.\nIn 1958, steel cans were introduced. Foster's Lager was first imported into the UK in 1971, and was launched in the US in 1972.\nCommencing 1981, the brand was brewed under licence in the UK by Watney Mann and Truman Brewers. In 1986, Courage Brewery obtained the rights to brew and distribute Foster's alongside Watney Mann and Truman Brewers, which Courage took over in 1990.\nIn 2011, CUB and its product lines, including Foster's, were bought by the South African and British conglomerate SABMiller, which in turn was incorporated into the multinational (Belgian, Brazilian, and American) Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2016. In 2019, Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to sell CUB including Fosters to Asahi Breweries. The deal was completed in 2020.\nProduction.\nAdvertising from the early 20th century claimed Foster's Lager was adjuncted with cane sugar. A number of breweries advertised a sugar content, (e.g. Bulimba), as it implied a lighter less bitter brew than was commonly sold. (Rice malt and very light barley malts replaced sugar, which can be troublesome for brewers.)\nThe Tim Foster's yeast in use today was brought to Carlton in 1923 from Professor Jorgensen in Denmark.\nThe lager is hopped with selected oil extracts of Super Pride of Ringwood hops, which like any modern beer, is added after fermentation to minimise losses to the yeast sediment. The hop is sourced from the only two farms in Australia that grow it.\nThe product is 4% ABV in Europe, Australia and India, and 5% in the US.\nThe Latin American and European rights to the beer are owned by Heineken International, who brews and distributes a 4% ABV Foster's in most European countries. In the United States and Canada, rights to the brand are owned by Molson Coors. Heineken also acquired Brasil Kirin which previously had the right to the beer in Latin America.\nIn the UK, Foster's is produced by Heineken at the Royal Brewery in Manchester.\nProduction of the Australian regular brand recommenced in 2014, but it was only briefly promoted. It had been in continuous production from November 1888 to about 2002, making it the longest-lived beer label in Australia. Once a \"premium\" brand, Foster's Lager has been bypassed by the Foster's Group's favoured premium brands of Carlton Crown Lager and Stella Artois.\nIn Australia until the end of the 1970s, Foster's Lager was a reasonably popular bottled and canned beer with a somewhat premium image. In the early 1980s there were major changes in the Australian brewing industry, including the merger of Castlemaine (Brisbane), Swan (Perth) and Toohey's (Sydney) into a national brewing group, as a result of acquisitions by Perth entrepreneur Alan Bond.\nFaced with inroads into its non-Victorian markets, Carlton and United Beverages (CUB) reviewed its product range and attempted to re-position some of its brands. Foster's Draught was introduced, served on tap alongside established draught brands such as Castlemaine XXXX and Toohey's Draught. Despite some initial success, bolstered by heavy advertising, the brand did not prove to be popular and was eventually withdrawn from sale.\nThe Foster's Group has tended to promote the brands of Carlton Draught (mainstream market) and Victoria Bitter (working class male market).\nThe CUB Yatala Road Brewery south of Brisbane, the site of the former Power's Brewery, brews all CUB mainstream and contract beers that are sold outside of Victoria. The Yatala Brewery is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. CUB's Abbotsford Brewery (Abbot's Lager) now only supplies Victoria and South Australia.\nIn late 2014 Foster's enjoyed some renewed success in the Australian market, due to returning to wide-release sale in Australian liquor stores with some renewed nostalgic brand recognition. Foster's lager was marketed as \"Foster's Classic\" and sold in 375ml cans with 4.0% ABV.\nIn November 2020, CUB announced that it would \"relaunch\" the brand in Australia, boosting local production by 300% and price it competitively against rival brands.\nIn Australia in 2024 CUB decided not to produce the original Foster's Lager 4.9% version. It has been replaced by Foster's Classic 4.0% version.\nGlobal market.\nIn April 2006, Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc announced that it had agreed to acquire the Foster's brand in Europe (including Turkey), the Russian Federation and other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States for approximately \u00a3309 million. In August 2006, SABMiller, now owned by AB InBev, announced that it had bought back rights to the Foster's brand in India for a reported $120m from private investors.\nAn unusual case emerged in 2015 when a New York consumer of Foster's Lager sued the brewer after \u2013 he claimed \u2013 discovering it was not brewed in Australia. He proposed a class action on the grounds of deceptive marketing. The suit cited advertising slogans such as 'Foster's Australian for Beer' and 'How to Speak Australian' were intended to trick consumers into believing the beer is made in Australia \u2013 which in turn meant the beer could be sold at a higher, premium price.\nA number of companies own marketing rights to Foster's including Heineken International in Latin America, Europe and CIS and Molson Coors in the U.S. and Canada.\nVariants.\nScottish &amp; Newcastle launched Foster's Twist, a beer with a hint of citrus that was marketed as a refreshing alternative to other heavier beers and Premium Packaged Spirits such as Smirnoff Ice. Foster's Twist was 4.5% abv. It has since been withdrawn from the market.\nThere also exists Foster's Super Chilled, which is served at a colder temperature and is available in pubs and bars.\nIn 2008, Foster's was introduced with a widget called a \"scuba\" placed into the can to ensure good mixing. This variant is only currently available in the UK.\nIn the UK, customers are also able to purchase a keg of Foster's for private parties, collecting and returning the keg at a participating store or public house.\nAlso, there is Fosters Gold which has a slightly higher alcohol percentage of 4.5% sold only in bottles.\nSponsorship.\nFrom 1964, the brand was promoted in the UK by comedian Barry Humphries and his \"Private Eye\" character Barry McKenzie, a bumbling Foster's swilling Australian expatriate.\nFoster's Lager used the slogan \"The Amber Nectar\" in Australia and the UK, and \"Australian for Beer\", elsewhere overseas. The overseas advertising of the product often focuses on the Australian connotations of the beer, e.g. with reference to stereotypical Australian imagery such as kangaroos, exaggerated accents, and cork hats. This was true of a campaign in the 1980s fronted by the Australian comedian Paul Hogan.\nThe 2009 campaign for Foster's contains two 40-second adverts, \"Backpacker\" and \"Deep Sea\"; both end with the slogan, \"Foster's \u2013 get some Australian in you.\"\nThe Foster's Lager brand was used as an advertising sponsorship deal with Norwich City F.C. from 1986 to 1989 (a period which included two top five finishes and a run to the FA Cup semi-finals).\nThe brand sponsored Formula One events regularly from 1986 to 2006. During this period it was the title sponsor for the Australian GP (1986\u20131993 and 2002\u20132006), the British GP (1990\u20131993 and 2000\u20132006) and the San Marino GP (2003\u20132006). It also was the prime sponsor and trackside sponsor of many other Grands Prix during this time. The brand was also used in a sponsorship deal with the A1 Team Australia from 2005 to 2007.\nThe UK division of the Foster's brand has focused on cultivating comedy-centric advertising and sponsorship arrangements and on 9 November 2011 they launched a trailer for their sponsored, online-only version of the hit 90s' television show \"The Fast Show\". The six weekly episodes started on 10 November and featured the original cast (with the exception of Mark Williams) and many of the characters from the previous series.\nFrom 2010 to 2015 Foster's adverts featured \"Good call\", in which numerous Britons phone up Australians Brad and Dan for general advice. The campaign was revived in 2019."}
{"id": "11315", "revid": "45201687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11315", "title": "Friends", "text": "Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and early 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and David Crane.\nKauffman and Crane began developing \"Friends\" under the working title \"Insomnia Cafe\" between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to \"Six of One\" and \"Friends Like Us\", the series was finally named \"Friends\". Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.\nAll ten seasons of \"Friends\" ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; ultimately reaching the number 1 spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth-most-watched series finale in television history and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s. \"Friends\" received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular and highest-grossing television shows of all time. The show's success led to a spin-off series, \"Joey\", and a reunion special, \"\".\nCast and characters.\nJames Michael Tyler appears as Gunther, a barista at Central Perk, in every season of the show, but is only ever credited as a guest star. Gunther has a mostly secret profound love for Rachel throughout the entire series. At one point he becomes the manager of the coffee house. It is revealed that Gunther speaks Dutch in addition to English, as well as being a former soap opera actor.\nIn their original contracts for the first season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode. The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode. Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member. The stars were each paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1\u00a0million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time. The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of a piece of the show's lucrative back-end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.\nSeries creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent, and the series was lauded as being \"the first true 'ensemble' show.\" The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate; they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards, opted for collective salary negotiations, and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season. The cast members also became best friends off-screen, so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt left out.\nThe cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco. In the official farewell commemorative book \"Friends 'Til the End\", each separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family.\nEpisodes.\nSeason 1.\nThe first season introduces the six main characters who live in New York City: Rachel Green, a waitress; professional chef Monica Geller; her paleontologist brother, Ross Geller; free-spirited masseuse Phoebe Buffay; struggling actor Joey Tribbiani; and Ross's college friend, Chandler Bing, whose precise occupation at a corporation is unknown. Rachel arrives at Central Perk, wearing her wedding dress, after leaving her fianc\u00e9, Barry Farber (Mitchell Whitfield), an orthodontist, at the altar. She moves into her high school friend Monica's apartment, and gets a waitress job at Central Perk.\nRoss, who has had a crush on Rachel since high school, often attempts to declare his feelings for her. However many obstacles stand in his way, including his insecurities, Rachel dating an Italian neighbor named Paolo, and the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol Willick (played first by Anita Barone and then Jane Sibbett), who gives birth to Ben Geller (Cole Sprouse) later in the season. Joey never has a steady girlfriend and constantly sleeps with a variety of women. Phoebe is rather odd and complex, mostly due to her mother Lily Buffay's suicide when she was a child and having lived on the streets for a time. However, the gang loves her regardless.\nChandler breaks up with his girlfriend, Janice Hosenstein (Maggie Wheeler), only to find himself reconnecting with her throughout the series. Near the end of the season, while Ross is at a paleontology dig in China, Chandler accidentally lets slip that Ross loves Rachel, who then realizes that she also cares for him. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross, who is returning from China.\nSeason 2.\nRachel greets Ross at the airport only to discover that he has returned with Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross that she loves him initially mirror his failed attempts in the first season. After he breaks up with Julie for Rachel, friction between them develops when Rachel discovers Ross's list of the cons of dating her. They eventually begin a relationship after Rachel sees an old home video from her and Monica's prom night and realizes Ross was going to stand in for her prom date Chip Matthews (Dan Gauthier) who nearly stood her up.\nMonica is promoted to head chef at the Iridium restaurant, then gets fired for accepting gifts from a supplier, which is against company policy. Needing money, she is forced to take an embarrassing job as a waitress at a 1950s-style diner. She begins dating Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend who is 21 years her senior. They eventually break up when Monica realizes that Richard, already a father, does not want more children. Joey is cast in a fictional version of the soap opera, \"Days of Our Lives\" as neurosurgeon Dr. Drake Ramoray. He moves out of his and Chandler's apartment, forcing Chandler to get a new roommate, Eddie Menuek (Adam Goldberg).\nHowever, Eddie is annoying and somewhat deranged. When Joey claims in a soap opera magazine interview that he writes many of his own lines, offending the show's writer (James E. Reilly), his character is killed off. No longer able to afford his expensive new apartment, Joey moves back in with Chandler, kicking Eddie out in the process. In the season finale, Chandler talks to an anonymous woman in an online chat room. When they agree to meet in person, the woman turns out to be Janice.\nSeason 3.\nSeason 3 takes on a significantly more serialized format. Chandler and Janice date for several episodes until Joey catches Janice kissing her soon-to-be ex-husband Gary Litman (Mark Cohen). Not wanting to destroy her family, Chandler urges Janice to go back to Gary, then becomes depressed over the breakup for several episodes. Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and begins working at Bloomingdale's, an upscale department store chain. Ross soon becomes jealous of her colleague Mark Robinson (Steven Eckholdt) and frustrated by Rachel's long work hours. She is tired of his constant jealousy and insecurity, and decides they need a relationship break.\nRoss, hurt and somewhat drunk, immediately sleeps with Chloe (Angela Featherstone), \"the hot girl from the Xerox place,\" causing Rachel to break up with him completely. Although Phoebe initially believes she has no family except her twin sister Ursula Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), she learns she has a half-brother, Frank Buffay, Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and discovers her birth mother, Phoebe Abbott (Teri Garr) over the course of the season. Joey falls in love with his acting partner Kate Miller (Dina Meyer), but is jealous of her dating Marshall Townend (Reg Rogers) the director of their play. They begin a brief relationship that ends when she takes an acting job in Los Angeles.\nMonica dates millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau), despite her initially not being attracted to him. However, she breaks up with Pete after he is seriously hurt trying to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion and refuses to quit. Phoebe sets Ross up on a date with her friend, Bonnie (Christine Taylor), inciting Rachel's jealousy. She tries sabotaging the relationship by coercing Bonnie to shave her head bald, and eventually admits to Ross that she still has feelings for him. The season closes with Ross having to choose between Rachel and Bonnie.\nSeason 4.\nIn the season 4 premiere, after Ross breaks up with Bonnie, he and Rachel briefly reconcile after Ross pretends to read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him. However, Ross continues to insist that the two were on a break when he slept with Chloe, so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey only forgives Chandler and allows him to date Kathy after Chandler spends Thanksgiving in a box as punishment.\nChandler's relationship with Kathy ends after he discovers that she cheated on him due to an argument. Phoebe loses her job as a masseuse after making out with one of her clients Rick Sanoven (Jason Brooks) and she accompanies Monica, who has become a caterer for hire. They soon start a catering business together but Monica, after negatively reviewing a restaurant, Allesandro's, is offered the position of head chef. Despite initially being pressured by the wrath of her co-workers, Monica eventually asserts her dominance in the kitchen. Phoebe becomes a surrogate for her brother and his fianc\u00e9e, Alice Knight (Debra Jo Rupp).\nMonica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between each other. After her boss Joanna (Alison La Placa) dies, Rachel is demoted to personal shopping and meets and later dates a customer named Joshua Burgin (Tate Donovan). Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily Waltham (Helen Baxendale), and they quickly get engaged. Rachel struggles to cope and hastily suggests to Joshua that they marry, after which he rejects her. In the season finale, the group, apart from a heavily pregnant Phoebe and Rachel, travel to Ross and Emily's wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel, realizing that she is still in love with Ross, rushes to London to stop Ross and Emily's wedding, but changes her mind when she sees them happy together. While saying his vows, Ross accidentally says Rachel's name at the altar, shocking his bride Emily and the guests.\nSeason 5.\nRoss and Emily marry, but an angry and humiliated Emily flees the reception. Rachel soon admits her love for Ross, but realizing how ridiculous this is, advises him to work on his marriage to Emily. She develops a crush on her neighbor Danny (George Newbern) and they date briefly, until she realizes that he is too close with his sister Krista (Julie Lauren). Monica and Chandler try to keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Buffay, Jr. Jr., and two girls, Leslie and Chandler Buffay, the latter of whom was supposed to be a boy, but was later revealed to be a girl.\nAfter weeks of trying to contact her, Emily agrees to reconcile with Ross and move to New York if he breaks off all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but later attends a dinner with all his friends, Rachel included. Emily phones Ross, discovers Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him and ends their marriage. Ross takes out his anger at work, resulting in him being indefinitely suspended from the museum, and he moves in with Chandler and Joey until eventually getting a new apartment across the street from them.\nRachel gets a new job at Ralph Lauren. Phoebe has a brief relationship with a police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own. Monica and Chandler go public with their relationship, to the surprise and delight of their friends. They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumbling out of the wedding chapel.\nSeason 6.\nIn the season 6 premiere, Ross and Rachel's marriage turns out to be a drunken mistake that neither remembers until the other friends mention it. Ross promises Rachel he will get them an annulment, then secretly does nothing because he cannot face having three failed marriages. By the time Rachel discovers they are still married, an annulment is impossible due to their history; they are forced to get a divorce. After ignoring the numerous signs that they should get married, Monica and Chandler decide to live together, forcing Rachel to move in with Phoebe. Joey gets a new roommate, Janine LaCroix (Elle Macpherson).\nJoey and Janine develop feelings for each other and date briefly until Janine criticizes Monica and Chandler, ending the relationship. After Janine moves out, Joey struggles with paying his bills so he takes a job at Central Perk. He soon lands a role on a cable TV series called \"Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.\", starring alongside a crime-fighting robot. Ross gets a teaching job at New York University. He dates Elizabeth Stevens (Alexandra Holden), a student, despite it being against university policy. Elizabeth's father, Paul Stevens (Bruce Willis), disapproves of Ross but falls for Rachel, and they start dating.\nBoth relationships soon end: Elizabeth is too immature for Ross, and previously reserved Paul opens up emotionally and is more than Rachel can handle. Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches fire, and Rachel moves in with Joey, while Phoebe stays with Chandler and Monica, though they later switch. While at a museum that has a two-year wait for weddings, Monica puts her name on the reservation list as a joke. When Chandler intercepts the museum's phone call about a cancellation, he panics; however, Chandler has been planning to propose while pretending he may never want to marry.\nWhile dining at a fancy restaurant, Chandler's planned proposal is subverted by Monica's ex-boyfriend Richard Burke, who unexpectedly shows up. Richard later tells Monica he wants to marry her and have children. Monica becomes upset at Chandler, believing his ruse about not wanting to marry. Chandler believes Monica has left him until he comes home to find their apartment decorated with candles and her waiting to propose to him. When she becomes too emotional to continue, Chandler proposes and she accepts.\nSeason 7.\nThe seventh season mainly follows Monica and Chandler as they plan their wedding amid various problems. Joey's television series, \"Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E\" is canceled, but he is offered his old role on \"Days of Our Lives\"; the show is retconned with the revelation that Dr. Drake Ramoray has been in a four-year coma and is revived with a brain transplant from Cecilia Monroe (Susan Sarandon)'s character Jessica Lockhart. Phoebe's repaired apartment now has one large bedroom instead of the original two, so Rachel permanently stays at Joey's. Rachel is promoted at Ralph Lauren and impulsively hires a young assistant, Tag Jones (Eddie Cahill), based on his looks, passing over a more qualified woman Hilda (Jean St. James). Tag discovers her feelings about him at Thanksgiving dinner, and they begin dating, hiding it from co-workers. However, on her 30th birthday, Rachel ends their relationship, realizing Tag is too young and immature, particularly if she intends to follow her marriage schedule.\nHours before Monica and Chandler's wedding ceremony, Chandler panics and goes into hiding just as Phoebe and Rachel find a positive pregnancy test in Monica and Chandler's bathroom. They assume Monica is pregnant. Ross and Phoebe find Chandler and convince him to return for the ceremony, though he briefly bolts again after overhearing Phoebe and Rachel discussing the pregnancy test. He quickly returns, embracing the idea of fatherhood. After the ceremony, Monica denies she is pregnant; unbeknown to everyone, the positive pregnancy test is Rachel's.\nSeason 8.\nSeason 8 begins at Monica and Chandler's wedding reception. Phoebe and Monica discover Rachel's pregnancy and persuade her to take another test to confirm it. Phoebe initially claims the test is negative, badly disappointing Rachel, then reveals it is positive, saying Rachel now knows how she really feels about having a baby. Ross is eventually revealed to be the father, and the season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy. Rachel and Ross agree to be co-parents without resuming their romantic relationship; Ross begins dating Mona (Bonnie Somerville), who is Monica's co-worker from Allesandro's.\nJoey takes Rachel out to quell her fears about motherhood, and realizes he has romantic feelings for her. While suppressing his feelings, he encourages Rachel to stay at Ross's apartment so he can be involved in the pregnancy. The arrangement is too much for Mona, and she breaks up with Ross. Joey tells Ross about his feelings for Rachel. Ross initially is angry, then gives his blessing. Joey tells Rachel that he loves her, but she realizes she does not feel the same way, and they remain friends. When Rachel goes into labor, Ross's mother Judy Geller (Christina Pickles) gives him a family heirloom ring and encourages him to propose to Rachel. Ross hesitates, and puts the ring in his jacket, which he later leaves in Rachel's room.\nAfter Monica jokes about having kids, she and Chandler decide to have a baby, starting while they are still at the hospital. After a prolonged labor, during which numerous other expectant mothers, including Janice, are taken to the delivery room, Rachel gives birth to baby Emma Geller-Green. She is left saddened and afraid after Janice later says that Ross may not always be there for her and the baby. When Joey comforts Rachel, the ring falls from Ross's jacket to the floor. Joey kneels to pick it up, and Rachel, believing he is proposing, impulsively says yes. Meanwhile, Ross intends to ask Rachel if she wants to resume their relationship.\nSeason 9.\nSeason nine begins with Ross and Rachel cohabitating with their daughter Emma, after Joey and Rachel clear up the proposal misunderstanding. Monica and Chandler run into obstacles as they try for a baby: Chandler unknowingly agrees to a work transfer to Tulsa just as Monica is offered a head chef job at a new restaurant, Javu, resulting in Chandler commuting back and forth. After being apart from Monica during Christmas, Chandler quits to pursue a new career in advertising, starting as an unpaid intern at an ad agency, and eventually being hired as a junior copywriter. Monica and Chandler discover they are physically incompatible to conceive and after considering multiple options, decide to adopt.\nPhoebe begins dating Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) for most of the season until Mike says that he never wants to marry again. Phoebe dates her ex-boyfriend from season 1, David (Hank Azaria) who plans on proposing to her, but Mike proposes first. Phoebe rejects both proposals but gets back together with Mike, only needing the reassurance that they have a future together. Rachel, believing that her co-worker Gavin Mitchell (Dermot Mulroney) is trying to steal her job while she is on maternity leave, returns to Ralph Lauren early. She discovers at her birthday party that Gavin has feelings for her. They kiss but do not pursue a relationship due to her history with Ross.\nMeanwhile, Ross, having seen the kiss, retaliates by dating other women. After realizing that her and Ross's living situation is too weird, Rachel and Emma move in with Joey. Rachel develops a crush on him, only to be disheartened when he starts dating Charlie Wheeler (Aisha Tyler), a new palaeontology professor to whom Ross is attracted. In the finale, the group travels to Barbados for Ross's keynote speech at a conference. Joey and Charlie break up upon realizing they have nothing in common. Joey then learns about Rachel's feelings for him, but says they cannot pursue this because of Ross. However, upon seeing Ross and Charlie kiss each other, he goes to Rachel's hotel room, and the finale ends with them kissing.\nSeason 10.\nThe tenth season brings several long-running story lines to a close. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross's feelings about their relationship, and after disastrous attempts to consummate, decide it is best they remain friends. Charlie breaks up with Ross to get back together with her ex-boyfriend Dr. Benjamin Hobart (Greg Kinnear). Mid-season, Joey officiates Phoebe and Mike's wedding outside the Central Perk coffee house after a snow storm paralyzes the city, preventing them and guests getting to the wedding venue. Monica and Chandler are chosen by a pregnant woman named Erica (Anna Faris) to adopt her baby.\nFollowing this, Monica and Chandler prepare to move to a house in the suburbs to raise their family, saddening everyone, particularly Joey, who is coping with all the changes in his life. In the series finale, Erica gives birth to fraternal twins Jack and Erica Bing, much to Monica and Chandler's surprise. Rachel is fired from Ralph Lauren after her boss Mr. Zelner (Steve Ireland) overhears her interviewing for a job at Gucci. She encounters her former Bloomingdale co-worker Mark, who offers her a new job at Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross, believing Rachel wants to stay, tries bribing Mr. Zelner to rehire her until he realizes Rachel wants to go to Paris. When Rachel says a tearful personal goodbye to everyone except Ross at her going away party, a hurt and angry Ross confronts Rachel, and they end up sleeping together.\nRachel leaves, and Ross \u2013 realizing how much he loves Rachel \u2013 chases her to the airport. When he reaches her, Rachel says she has to go to Paris. Before the plane takes off, Rachel calls Ross's home phone and leaves a voice mail, apologizing for the way it ended. While speaking, she realizes that she loves him too, and gets off the plane at the last minute. The series ends with all the friends, plus Monica and Chandler's new babies, leaving the empty apartment together for a final cup of coffee at Central Perk. The show ends first with a shot of everyone's keys to Monica and Chandler's apartment left on the counter top, and then pans to a shot of the apartment's purple door.\nProduction.\nConception.\nDavid Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom \"Family Album\" was cancelled by CBS in 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about \"six people in their 20s making their way in Manhattan\" to NBC since they thought it would fit best there. (Film director and screenwriter Cameron Crowe has asserted that the concept originated with Warner Bros. Television wanting him to make his 1992 movie \"Singles\" into a television show. Crowe alleges that when he refused permission, the idea was then taken over by Crane and Kaufman, who changed some details from the premise of the movie while developing the show.)\nCrane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series \"Dream On\". The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was \"more of a question mark.\" They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed \"everybody knows that feeling\", and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time. The team titled the series \"Insomnia Cafe\" and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.\nAt the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses after he regretted passing on the Black sitcom \"Living Single\". Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become \"new, surrogate family members.\" However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched \"Insomnia Cafe\", Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were. NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed.\nKauffman and Crane took three days to write the pilot script for a show they titled \"Friends Like Us.\" Littlefield wanted the series to \"represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding\", but the rest disagreed. Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching. NBC liked the script and ordered the series. They changed the title to \"Six of One\", mainly because they felt \"Friends Like Us\" was too similar to the ABC sitcom \"These Friends of Mine\".\nCasting.\nOnce it became apparent that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client to be a part of the series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and these actors were asked to read for Les Moonves, then president of Warner Bros. Television.\nHaving worked with David Schwimmer in the past, the series creators wrote the character of Ross Geller with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast. Courteney Cox wanted to play the role of Monica Geller because she liked the \"strong\" character, but the producers had her in mind to play Rachel Green because of her \"cheery, upbeat energy\", which was not how they envisioned Monica; after Cox's audition, though, Kauffman agreed with Cox, and she got the role. When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey Tribbiani, he put a \"different spin\" on the character. He played Joey more simple-minded than intended and gave the character heart. Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him. Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow were cast as Rachel, Chandler Bing and Phoebe Buffay based on their auditions. Perry and Aniston, both still under contract to other shows that year, \"LAX 2194\" and \"Muddling Through\", were cast days before shooting of the pilot began.\nMore changes occurred to the series's storylines during the casting process. The writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey's character became \"this whole new being\", and that \"it wasn't until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun Monica's neuroses are.\"\nWriting.\nIn the weeks after NBC's pick up of \"Friends\", Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced \"Seinfeld\" episodes. Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because \"When you're 40, you can't do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.\" The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for \"myriad storylines and give the show legs.\" The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas. Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script.\nDuring the production of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight. NBC also wanted the writers to include an older character to balance out the young ones. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured \"Pat the Cop\" who would be used to provide advice to the other characters. Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, \"You know the book, \"Pat the Bunny\"? We had Pat the Cop.\" NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.\nEach summer, the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. The hardest episodes to write were always \"the first one and the last one of each season.\" Unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel.\nThe storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby Emma Geller-Green, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.\nThe episode title format\u2014\"The One ...\"\u2014was created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits, and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience. Episode titles officially begin with \"The One ...\" except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale \"The Last One\". The season 5 episode \"The One Hundredth\" has the alternative title of \"The One With The Triplet\".\nFilming.\nThe first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented to the coffee house concept. The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00\u00a0am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning. At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage\u00a024, which was renamed The \"Friends\" Stage after the series finale.\nFilming for the series began during the summer of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters. A hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes. Each 22-minute episode took six hours to film\u2014twice the length of most sitcom tapings\u2014mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.\nAlthough the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, \"Friends\" was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series. When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and \"for the audience to be able to see what's going on\". The apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the actions in the scripts.\nThe fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because the producers were aware of the series' popularity in the UK. The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.\nSeries finale.\nThe series's creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing. Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, deeming \"The Last Show\", the finale of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" to be the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:\nNBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of \"Dateline NBC\", one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before the airing of the episode. Following the finale, \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" was filmed on the set of the \"Friends\"' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the \"Seinfeld\" finale at $1.7 million.\nIn the U.S., 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the \"Seinfeld\" finale in 1998. The finale was the fifth most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of \"M*A*S*H\" (\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\"), \"Cheers\" (\"One for the Road\"), \"The Fugitive\", (\"The Judgment\") and \"Seinfeld\", which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4, 78.0 and 76.3 million viewers. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36 million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl. Following the finales of \"Friends\" and \"Frasier\", media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre, and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.\nReunion special.\nOn November 12, 2019, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that Warner Bros TV was developing a \"Friends\" reunion for HBO Max that would feature the whole cast and creators returning. On February 21, 2020, HBO confirmed that the unscripted reunion special, tentatively named \"The One Where They Got Back Together\", was set to be released in May the same year, along with the 236 original episodes of the series. On March 18, 2020, it was announced that the special, which was set to film on the \"Friends\" Stage on March 23 and 24, had been postponed indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, Matthew Perry tweeted that the reunion is set to start filming in March 2021. On May 13, 2021, a teaser trailer was released officially announcing \"\" also known as \"The One Where They Get Back Together\". The reunion special was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nEarly reviews of the series were mixed; the first season holds a Metacritic score of 65 out of 100, based on 24 sampled reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". Tom Feran of \"The Plain Dealer\" wrote that the series traded \"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of \"Seinfeld\"\", while Ann Hodges of the \"Houston Chronicle\" called it \"the new \"Seinfeld\" wannabe, but it will never be as funny as \"Seinfeld\".\" In the \"Los Angeles Daily News\", Ray Richmond named the series as \"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\", and the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\"\nThe \"Chicago Sun-Times\" Ginny Holbert found Joey and Rachel's characters to be underdeveloped, while Richmond commended the cast as a \"likeable youth ensemble\" with \"good chemistry.\" Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him \"terrific.\" He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry's role as Chandler was \"undefined\" and that LeBlanc was \"relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it.\" The authors of \"Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends\" thought that the cast was \"trying just a little too hard\"; in particular, Perry and Schwimmer.\nAs the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and \"Friends\" became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows. Critics commended the series for having consistently sharp writing and for the chemistry between the main actors. Noel Holston of \"Newsday\", who had dismissed the pilot as a \"so-so \"Seinfeld\" wannabe\" in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after re-watching the episode and felt like writing an apology to the writers. Heather Havrilesky of \"Salon.com\" thought that the series \"hit its stride\" in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations \"could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode\", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be \"original and innovative.\"\nBill Carter of \"The New York Times\" called the eighth season a \"truly stunning comeback.\" Carter found that by \"generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs\", the series made its way \"back into the hearts of its fans.\" However, Liane Bonin of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that the direction of the ninth season was a \"disappointing buzzkill\", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that \"the writing [was] still sharp.\" Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was \"alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be.\" \"Friends\" was featured on \"Time\"s list of \"The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time\", saying, \"the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself \"Friends\", and was really about family.\"\nReviews of the series finale were mostly positive. \"USA Today\"s Robert Bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars. Sarah Rodman of the \"Boston Herald\" praised Aniston and Schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters' reunion was \"a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show's legions of fans wanted.\" Roger Catlin of the \"Hartford Courant\" felt that newcomers to the series would be \"surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters.\" Ken Parish Perkins, writing for \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\", pointed out that the finale was \"more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny.\"\nIn a 2021 program on ITV, \"Mr. Bean\" writer Richard Curtis accused the \"Friends\" writers of stealing the joke which involved Joey getting a turkey stuck on his head in \"The One with All the Thanksgivings\" from the 1992 episode \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean\". In that episode, Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) got a turkey stuck on his head after losing his watch while stuffing the turkey and put his head in to try to retrieve it. Rowan Atkinson, however, argued that jokes are meant to be stolen, or to inspire.\nAwards.\nTo maintain the series' ensemble format, the main cast members decided to enter themselves in the same acting categories for awards. Beginning with the eighth season, the actors decided to submit themselves in the lead actor balloting, rather than in the supporting actor fields. The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning six.\nAniston and Kudrow are the only main cast members to win an Emmy, while Cox is the only actor not to be nominated. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2002, receiving nominations in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2003. The series also won an American Comedy Award, one GLAAD Media Award, one Golden Globe Award, three Logie Awards, six People's Choice Awards, one Satellite Award, and one Screen Actors Guild Award.\nRatings.\nThe table below shows the ratings of \"Friends\" in the United States, where it consistently ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings. \"Rank\" refers to how well \"Friends\" rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season. \"Viewers\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series' regular timeslot. The \"season premiere\" is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the \"season finale\" is the date that the final episode of the season aired. Following the September 11 attacks, ratings increased 17% over the previous season.\nSyndication.\nBecause of syndication revenue, \"Friends\" continues to generate approximately $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. That translates into about $20 million in annual residuals each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each get 2% of syndication income for \"Friends\".\nAll episodes became available on Netflix on January 1, 2015, introducing a new generation to the show. UK \"Friends\" reruns' ratings in 2015 increased by more than 10% annually. The 2016 reruns' US weekly audience, not including streaming, of 16 million would make it a hit on network television were the show still being produced. In the US, the series has a syndication deal through multiple networks, including Nick at Nite, TBS, and Paramount Network. In July 2019, it was announced that from the beginning of 2020, \"Friends\" would not be available on Netflix in the US and instead would be shown on Warner Bros. Discovery's video-streaming service HBO Max, which launched in May 2020.\nLegacy and cultural impact.\nAlthough the producers thought of \"Friends\" as \"only a TV show\", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of \"Friends\" during the series' run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world. Joey's catchphrase, \"How \"you\" doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"so\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech. The show's availability on streaming television\u2014it accounted for 4% of all Netflix views in 2018\u2014gave it a large new Gen Z audience. Kauffman reported that her high school daughter's friends thought that \"Friends\" was a new period piece about the 1990s. One young fan described the show as \"aspirational ... [kids hope] that when they're that age ... they'll have those friends\".\n\"Friends\" has been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter (26%) of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English. Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool Football Club manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, South Korean band BTS member RM, and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters.\n\"Friends\" developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people who live unconventional domestic lives. It presented the idea that \"all you need are good friends\" and that you can construct families through choice. The audience was able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrayed a new way of living life and developing relationships which were not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, \"Friends\" is \"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centers around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.\n\"Vox\" stated that \"Friends\" had an impact on the creation of other conflictless \"hangout sitcoms\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is \"How I Met Your Mother\", which \"The Guardian\"s TV and radio blog noted also shares its setting (Manhattan) with \"Friends\". Other examples include \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"New Girl\", and \"Happy Endings\".\nReaders of \"TV Guide\" voted the cast of \"Friends\" their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating \"Seinfeld\", which registered 18%. A poll undertaken by \"60 Minutes\" and \"Vanity Fair\" named \"Friends\" the third-greatest sitcom of all time. In 2014, the series was ranked by \"Mundo Estranho\" the Best TV Series of All Time. A 2015 survey by \"The Hollywood Reporter\" of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named \"Friends\" as their No. 1 favorite show.\n\"Friends\" was parodied in the twelfth season \"Murder, She Wrote\" episode \"Murder Among Friends\". In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) investigates the murder of Ricki Vardian (Cindy Katz) a producer for \"Buds\", a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved \"Murder, She Wrote\" from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite \"Friends\" on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother, and \"Murder, She Wrote\"s supervising producer, as having \"a bit of an attitude\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\" Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \"flavor\" of \"Buds\" by watching episodes of \"Friends\".\nProducers of \"Married... with Children\" attempted to create a spinoff series called \"Enemies\", which was intended to act as an antithesis to \"Friends\" the same way \"Married... with Children\" had been an antithesis to family sitcoms such as \"The Cosby Show\". However, the Fox network declined to pick up the series.\nCoffee house.\nThe Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it. The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by \"Friends\", featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing \"Friends\" episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays Gunther, the Central Perk manager in the series, attended the grand opening of the Dubai caf\u00e9, where he worked as a waiter.\nCentral Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in October 2008 when Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004. From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was on Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold coffee to customers and featured a display of \"Friends\" memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \"The One with the Football\". In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.\nIn India, there are six \"Friends\"-themed cafes which features many icons from the original TV series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. One named Central Perk is in Chandigarh, Kolkata; one named F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Cafe in West Bengal, and the others are in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra.\nIn 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk replica outside of the United States that has been given intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. The caf\u00e9 includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters' apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show.\nIn August 2019, Lego launched a Central Perk Lego set to mark the show's 25 anniversary.\nDistribution.\nBroadcast.\nAfter the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name \"Friends\" on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30 p.m. time slot. The pilot aired between \"Mad About You\" and \"Seinfeld\", and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. \nHaving already made huge success in the United States, \"Friends\" producers decided to air the show in Europe. It premiered in the United Kingdom on April 28, 1995. Season 1 was broadcast until September 1995 on Channel 4 at 9:30 PM on Friday nights, and immediately was a success. The popularity of the show allowed \"I'll Be There for You\" the theme song by the Rembrandts to hit number 3 on the UK Singles Charts in September 1995.\nWhen Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that \"Friends\" would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money\u2014$7 million per episode\u2014that it took to bring the series back for another season. After year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.\nIn fall 2001, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both were owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication. Warner Bros. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to \"Friends\" to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs). Warner Bros. was expected to make $200 million in license fees and advertising from the deal. Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6 pm. ET for six years through fall 2017. In syndication until 2005, \"Friends\" had earned $4 million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944 million.\nRemaster.\nBeginning in March 2012, high definition versions of all 236 \"Friends\" episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire widescreen frame. Because the show was not originally filmed for widescreen, but rather filmed in 4-perf format and protected for 4:3, some cropping problems arise in some shots where information from the top and bottom of the frame is removed, and some expanded shots reveal unintentional artifacts, including set edges, boom mics and body doubles replacing some of the main cast.\nIn early versions of the HD remasters, there were also a few shots, including chroma effects shots, which were sourced from standard-definition videotape sources, as not all of the footage had been located in time for the remaster. The original film sources for these shots were later rescanned for later broadcast and release. These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011, and the earlier HD prints continue to air on Comedy Central in the United Kingdom as of 2020. Netflix added all ten seasons of \"Friends\" in high definition to its streaming service in the United States in January 2015 before the platform discontinued the series in late 2019.\nHome media.\nAll ten seasons have been released on DVD individually and as a box set. Each Region 1 season release contains special features and are presented in their aforementioned original international broadcast versions, although Region 2 releases are as originally aired domestically. For the first season, each episode is updated with color correction and sound enhancement. A wide range of \"Friends\" merchandise has been produced by various companies. In September 1995, WEA Records released the first album of music from \"Friends\", the \"Friends Original TV Soundtrack\", containing music featured in previous and future episodes. The soundtrack debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 46, and sold 500,000 copies in November 1995.\nIn 1999, a second soundtrack album entitled \"Friends Again\" was released. Other merchandise includes a \"Friends\" version of the DVD game \"Scene It?\", and a quiz video game for PlayStation 2 and PC entitled \"Friends: The One with All the Trivia\". On September 28, 2009, a box set was released in the UK celebrating the show's 15th anniversary. The box set contained extended episodes, an episode guide, and original special features.\nWarner Home Video released a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012. In September 2024, the entire series was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the show.\nSpin-off.\nAfter the series finale in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, \"Joey\", following Joey's move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright agreed to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan. NBC heavily promoted \"Joey\" and gave it \"Friends\"' Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot.\nThe pilot was watched by 18.6 million American viewers, but ratings continually decreased throughout the series's two seasons, averaging 10.2 million viewers in the first season and 7.1 million in the second. The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006, was watched by 7.09 million viewers; NBC cancelled the series on May 15, 2006, after two seasons, leaving eight episodes unaired. Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series:\nFurther reading.\nArticles concerning the cultural influence of the program:"}

Bush, following the September 11 attacks\n(9/11 incident). Initially, the list contained 22 of the top suspected terrorists chosen by the FBI, all of whom had earlier been indicted for acts of terrorism between 1985 and 1998. None of the 22 had been captured by US or other authorities by that date. Of the 22, only Osama Bin Laden was by then already listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.\nNo particular legal consequences flowed from the creation of and inclusion on the list. On January 17, 2002, the FBI released a third major FBI wanted list, which has now become known as the FBI Seeking Information \u2013 War on Terrorism list, to enlist the public's help in reporting information which may prevent future terrorist attacks. The information sought to be reported is not necessarily relating to any person on any of the FBI wanted lists.\nInitial persons alleged to be terrorist fugitives.\nOn the fugitive group wanted poster, the FBI did not list the persons in any particular stated order, except perhaps for the consistent placing of bin Laden in the number one position of the top row. However, the 22 can easily fit into distinct categories over the two decades, based on the terrorist attacks in which they were, according to US authorities, involved.\nFor organization and ease of reference here, the 22 on the list are grouped by the attack for which they were placed on the list.\nFBI Seeking Information \u2013 War on Terrorism list.\nWhereas the Most Wanted Terrorists list is reserved for terrorist fugitives who have been indicted by federal grand juries, the FBI recognized a further need to achieve a much quicker response time in order to prevent any future attacks which may be in the current planning stages. To enlist the public's help in this effort, the FBI sought a way to deliver the early known suspected terror attack information, often very limited, out to the public as quickly as possible. So, on January 17, 2002, the third major FBI wanted list was first released, which has now become known as the FBI Seeking Information \u2013 Terrorism list.\nAs the name of this list implies, the FBI's intent is to acquire any critical information from the public, as soon as possible, about the suspected terrorists, who may be in the planning stages of terror attacks against United States nationals at home and abroad. The first such list profiled five persons about whom little was known, but who were suspected of plotting terrorist attacks in martyrdom operations. The main evidence against the five was five videos they had produced, found in the rubble of Mohammed Atef's destroyed home outside Kabul, Afghanistan.\nAdditions to the list.\nBy 2006, more than four years had passed since the FBI had listed the original 22 alleged terrorists on the Most Wanted Terrorist list. Of those 22, by then four had been qualified for removal from the list, due to death or capture. Also by then, the FBI determined that other people qualified for the list. Some were indicted for attacks and plots that had taken place since the original list had been compiled. The original indictments had been for incidents only through 1998. The US had been victim to at least two significant terror attacks, which had generated new indictments, notably:\nIn addition, after the original 2001 list had been compiled and released to the public, the US had foiled and issued indictments for numerous other plots, involving some new listed Most Wanted Terrorists. Those notable other plots involved:\nIn February 2006, the FBI completed two groups of additions to the Most Wanted Terrorists list, the first additions in over four years. On February 24, 2006, the day after adding two names to the list, the FBI added an additional six fugitive terrorists, for various plots and attacks. One of the entries was for an indictment dating back to the June 14, 1985, hijacking of TWA flight 847 by Hezbollah (see above).\nAdditionally, the FBI also added to the Seeking Information \u2013 War on Terrorism list an additional three people, most notably, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. This marked the first time that al-Zarqawi had appeared on any of the three major FBI wanted lists. On June 8, 2006, ABC News reported that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was confirmed to have been killed in Baghdad in a bombing raid by a United States task force. His death was confirmed by multiple sources in Iraq, including the United States government.\nRewards.\nSince 1984, the United States government has also used the Rewards for Justice Program, which pays monetary rewards of up to $25 million, or now, in some cases more, upon special authorization by the United States Secretary of State, to individuals who provide information which substantially leads to countering of terrorist attacks against United States persons. More than $100 million had been paid to over 60 people through this program.\nThe Rewards for Justice Program was established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public Law 98-533, and is administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, within the U.S. Department of State."}
{"id": "11319", "revid": "2842084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11319", "title": "Francis Bacon", "text": "Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Alban, 1st Baron Verulam, PC (; 22 January 1561 \u2013 9 April 1626) was an English philosopher and statesman who served as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England under King James\u00a0I. Bacon argued for the importance of natural philosophy, guided by scientific method, and his works remained influential throughout the Scientific Revolution.\nBacon has been called the father of empiricism. He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. He believed that science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon one of the later founders of the scientific method. His portion of the method based in scepticism was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, whose practical details are still central to debates on science and methodology. He is famous for his role in the scientific revolution, promoting scientific experimentation as a way of glorifying God and fulfilling scripture.\nBacon was a patron of libraries and developed a system for cataloguing books under three categories\u00a0\u2013 history, poetry, and philosophy\u00a0\u2013 which could further be divided into specific subjects and subheadings. About books he wrote: \"Some books are to be tasted; others swallowed; and some few to be chewed and digested.\" The Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship, a fringe theory which was first proposed in the mid-19th century, contends that Bacon wrote at least some and possibly all of the plays conventionally attributed to William Shakespeare.\nBacon was educated at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he rigorously followed the medieval curriculum, which was presented largely in Latin. He was the first recipient of the Queen's counsel designation, conferred in 1597 when Elizabeth\u00a0I reserved him as her legal advisor. After the accession of James\u00a0I in 1603, Bacon was knighted, then created Baron Verulam in 1618 and Viscount St Alban in 1621. He had no heirs, and so both titles became extinct on his death of pneumonia in 1626 at the age of 65. He is buried at St Michael's Church, St Albans, Hertfordshire.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nFrancis Bacon was born on 22 January 1561 at York House near Strand in London, the son of Sir Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper of the Great Seal) by his second wife, Anne (Cooke) Bacon, the daughter of the noted Renaissance humanist Anthony Cooke. His mother's sister was married to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, making Burghley Bacon's uncle.\nBiographers believe that Bacon was educated at home in his early years owing to poor health, which would plague him throughout his life. He received tuition from John Walsall, a graduate of Oxford with a strong leaning toward Puritanism. He attended Trinity College at the University of Cambridge on 5 April 1573 at the age of 12, living there for three years along with his older brother Anthony Bacon (1558\u20131601) under the personal tutelage of John Whitgift, future Archbishop of Canterbury. Bacon's education was conducted largely in Latin and followed the medieval curriculum. It was at Cambridge that Bacon first met Queen Elizabeth, who was impressed by his precocious intellect, and was accustomed to calling him \"The young lord keeper\".\nHis studies brought him to the belief that the methods and results of science as then practised were erroneous. His reverence for Aristotle conflicted with his rejection of Aristotelian philosophy, which seemed to him barren, argumentative and wrong in its objectives.\nOn 27 June 1576, he and Anthony entered \"de societate magistrorum\" at Gray's Inn. A few months later, Francis went abroad with Sir Amias Paulet, the English ambassador at Paris, while Anthony continued his studies at home. The state of government and society in France under Henry III afforded him valuable political instruction. For the next three years he visited Blois, Poitiers, Tours, Italy, and Spain. There is no evidence that he studied at the University of Poitiers. During his travels, Bacon studied language, statecraft, and civil law while performing routine diplomatic tasks. On at least one occasion he delivered diplomatic letters to England for Walsingham, Burghley, Leicester, and for the queen.\nThe sudden death of his father in February 1579 prompted Bacon to return to England. Sir Nicholas had laid up a considerable sum of money to purchase an estate for his youngest son, but he died before doing so, and Francis was left with only a fifth of that money. Having borrowed money, Bacon got into debt. To support himself, he took up his residence in law at Gray's Inn in 1579, his income being supplemented by a grant from his mother Lady Anne of the manor of Marks near Romford in Essex, which generated a rent of \u00a346.\nParliamentarian.\nBacon stated that he had three goals: to uncover truth, to serve his country, and to serve his church. He sought to achieve these goals by seeking a prestigious post. In 1580, through his uncle, Lord Burghley, he applied for a post at court that might enable him to pursue a life of learning, but his application failed. For two years he worked quietly at Gray's Inn, until he was admitted as an outer barrister in 1582.\nHis parliamentary career began when he was elected MP for Bossiney, Cornwall, in a by-election in 1581. In 1584 he took his seat in Parliament for Melcombe in Dorset, and in 1586 for Taunton. At this time, he began to write on the condition of parties in the church, as well as on the topic of philosophical reform in the lost tract \"Temporis Partus Maximus\". Yet he failed to gain a position that he thought would lead him to success. He showed signs of sympathy to Puritanism, attending the sermons of the Puritan chaplain of Gray's Inn and accompanying his mother to the Temple Church to hear Walter Travers. This led to the publication of his earliest surviving tract, which criticized the English church's suppression of the Puritan clergy. In the Parliament of 1586, he openly urged execution for the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots.\nAbout this time, he again approached his powerful uncle for help; this move was followed by his rapid progress at the bar. He became a bencher in 1586 and was elected a Reader in 1587, delivering his first set of lectures in Lent the following year. In 1589, he received the valuable appointment of reversion to the Clerkship of the Star Chamber, although he did not formally take office until 1608; the post was worth \u00a31,600 a year.\nIn 1588 he became MP for Liverpool and then for Middlesex in 1593. He later sat three times for Ipswich (1597, 1601, 1604) and once for Cambridge University (1614).\nHe became known as a liberal-minded reformer, eager to amend and simplify the law. Though a friend of the crown, he opposed feudal privileges and dictatorial powers. He spoke against religious persecution. He struck at the House of Lords in its usurpation of the Money Bills. He advocated for the union of England and Scotland, which made him a significant influence toward the consolidation of the United Kingdom; and he later would advocate for the integration of Ireland into the Union. Closer constitutional ties, he believed, would bring greater peace and strength to these countries.\nFinal years of Elizabeth's reign.\nBacon soon became acquainted with Robert Devereux, the 2nd Earl of Essex, Queen Elizabeth's favourite. By 1591 he acted as the earl's confidential adviser. In 1592, he was commissioned to write a tract in response to the Jesuit Robert Parson's anti-government polemic, which he titled \"Certain Observations Made upon a Libel\", identifying England with the ideals of democratic Athens against the belligerence of Spain. Bacon took his third parliamentary seat for Middlesex when in February 1593 Elizabeth summoned Parliament to investigate a Roman Catholic plot against her. Bacon's opposition to a bill that would levy triple subsidies in half the usual time offended the Queen: opponents accused him of seeking popularity, and for a time the Court excluded him from favour.\nWhen the office of Attorney General fell vacant in 1594, Lord Essex's influence was not enough to secure the position for Bacon and it was given to Sir Edward Coke. Likewise, Bacon failed to secure the lesser office of Solicitor General in 1595, the Queen pointedly snubbing him by appointing Sir Thomas Fleming instead. To console him for these disappointments, Essex presented him with a property at Twickenham, which Bacon subsequently sold for \u00a31,800.\nIn 1597 Bacon became the first Queen's Counsel designate, when Queen Elizabeth reserved him as her legal counsel. In 1597, he was also given a patent, giving him precedence at the Bar. Despite his designations, he was unable to gain the status and notoriety of others. In a plan to revive his position he unsuccessfully courted the wealthy young widow Lady Elizabeth Hatton. His courtship failed after she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to Sir Edward Coke, a further spark of enmity between the men. In 1598 Bacon was arrested for debt. Afterward, however, his standing in the Queen's eyes improved. Gradually, Bacon earned the standing of one of the learned counsels. His relationship with the Queen further improved when he severed ties with Essexa shrewd move, as Essex would be executed for treason in 1601.\nWith others, Bacon was appointed to investigate the charges against Essex. A number of Essex's followers confessed that Essex had planned a rebellion against the Queen. Bacon was subsequently a part of the legal team headed by the Attorney General Sir Edward Coke at Essex's treason trial. After the execution, the Queen ordered Bacon to write the official government account of the trial, which was later published as \"A DECLARATION of the Practices and Treasons attempted and committed by Robert late Earle of Essex and his Complices, against her Majestie and her Kingdoms ...\" after Bacon's first draft was heavily edited by the Queen and her ministers.\nAccording to his personal secretary and chaplain, William Rawley, as a judge Bacon was always tender-hearted, \"looking upon the examples with the eye of severity, but upon the person with the eye of pity and compassion\". And also that \"he was free from malice\", \"no revenger of injuries\", and \"no defamer of any man\".\nJames I comes to the throne.\nThe succession of James I brought Bacon into greater favour. He was knighted in 1603. In another shrewd move, Bacon wrote his \"Apologies\" in defence of his proceedings in the case of Essex, as Essex had favoured James to succeed to the throne. The following year, during the course of the uneventful first parliamentary session, Bacon married Alice Barnham. In June 1607, he was at last rewarded with the office of Solicitor General and in 1608 he began working as the Clerk of the Star Chamber. Despite a generous income, old debts still could not be paid. He sought further promotion and wealth by supporting King James and his arbitrary policies. In 1610 the fourth session of James's first Parliament met. Despite Bacon's advice to him, James and the Commons found themselves at odds over royal prerogatives and the King's embarrassing extravagance. The House was finally dissolved in February 1611. Throughout this period Bacon managed to stay in favour with the King while retaining the confidence of the Commons.\nIn 1613 Bacon was finally appointed Attorney General, after advising the King to shuffle judicial appointments. As Attorney General, Bacon, by his zealous effortswhich included tortureto obtain the conviction of Edmund Peacham for treason, raised legal controversies of high constitutional importance. Bacon and Gray's Inn produced \"The Masque of Flowers\" to celebrate the wedding of Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset and his wife, Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset, and he successfully prosecuted them for murder in 1616.\nThe so-called Prince's Parliament of April 1614 objected to Bacon's presence in the seat for Cambridge and to the various royal plans that Bacon had supported. Although he was allowed to stay, Parliament passed a law that forbade the Attorney General to sit in Parliament. His influence over the King had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as Lord Chancellor. On 12 July 1618 the King created Bacon Baron Verulam of Verulam in the Peerage of England; he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam.\nBacon continued to use his influence with the King to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage as Viscount St Alban on 27 January 1621.\nLord Chancellor and public disgrace.\nBacon's public career ended in disgrace in 1621. After he fell into debt, a parliamentary committee on the administration of the law charged him with 23 separate counts of corruption. His lifelong enemy, Sir Edward Coke, who had instigated these accusations, was one of those appointed to prepare the charges against the chancellor. To the lords, who sent a committee to enquire whether a confession was really his, he replied, \"My lords, it is my act, my hand, and my heart; I beseech your lordships to be merciful to a broken reed.\" He was sentenced to a fine of \u00a340,000 and committed to the Tower of London at the king's pleasure; the imprisonment lasted only a few days and the fine was remitted by the king. More seriously, parliament declared Bacon incapable of holding future office or sitting in parliament. He narrowly escaped undergoing degradation, which would have stripped him of his titles of nobility. Subsequently, the disgraced viscount devoted himself to study and writing.\nThere seems little doubt that Bacon had accepted gifts from litigants, but this was an accepted custom of the time and not necessarily evidence of deeply corrupt behaviour. While acknowledging that his conduct had been lax, he countered that he had never allowed gifts to influence his judgement and, indeed, he had on occasion given a verdict against those who had paid him. He even had an interview with King James in which he assured:\nHe also wrote the following to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham:\nAs the conduct of accepting gifts was ubiquitous and common practice, and the Commons was zealously inquiring into judicial corruption and malfeasance, it has been suggested that Bacon served as a scapegoat to divert attention from Buckingham's own ill practice and alleged corruption.\nThe true reason for his acknowledgement of guilt is the subject of debate, but some authors speculate that it may have been prompted by his sickness, or by a view that through his fame and the greatness of his office he would be spared harsh punishment. He may even have been blackmailed, with a threat to charge him with sodomy, into confession.\nThe British jurist Basil Montagu wrote in Bacon's defense, concerning the episode of his public disgrace:\nPersonal life.\nReligious beliefs.\nBacon was a devout Anglican. He believed that philosophy and the natural world must be studied inductively, but argued that we can only study arguments for the existence of God. Information about God's attributes (such as nature, action, and purposes) can only come from special revelation. Bacon also held that knowledge was cumulative, that study encompassed more than a simple preservation of the past. \"Knowledge is the rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man's estate,\" he wrote. In his Essays, he affirms that \"a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.\"\nBacon's idea of idols of the mind may have self-consciously represented an attempt to Christianize science at the same time as developing a new, reliable scientific method; Bacon gave worship of Neptune as an example of the idola tribus fallacy, hinting at the religious dimensions of his critique of the idols.\nBacon was against the splintering within Christianity, believing that it would ultimately lead to the creation of atheism as a dominant worldview, as indicated with his quote that \"The causes of atheism are: divisions in religion, if they be many; for any one main division, addeth zeal to both sides; but many divisions introduce atheism. Another is, scandal of priests; when it is come to that which St. Bernard saith \"One cannot now say the priest is as the people, for the truth is that the people are not so bad as the priest\". A third is, custom of profane scoffing in holy matters; which doth by little and little deface the reverence of religion. And lastly, learned times, specially with peace and prosperity; for troubles and adversities do more bow men's minds to religion.\"\nArchitectural projects.\nBacon built Verulam House in St Albans to his own designs. It has been suggested that this building was derivative of Sir Rowland Hill's building at Soulton Hall.\nMarriage to Alice Barnham.\nWhen he was 36, Bacon courted Elizabeth Hatton, a young widow of 20. Reportedly, she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to a wealthier man, Bacon's rival, Sir Edward Coke. Years later, Bacon still wrote of his regret that the marriage to Hatton had not taken place.\nAt the age of 45, Bacon married Alice Barnham, the 13-year-old daughter of a well-connected London alderman and MP. Bacon wrote two sonnets proclaiming his love for Alice. The first was written during his courtship and the second on his wedding day, 10 May 1606. When Bacon was appointed lord chancellor, \"by special Warrant of the King\", Lady Bacon was given precedence over all other Court ladies. Bacon's personal secretary and chaplain, William Rawley, wrote in his biography of Bacon that his marriage was one of \"much conjugal love and respect\", mentioning a robe of honour that he gave to Alice and which \"she wore unto her dying day, being twenty years and more after his death\".\nHowever, an increasing number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with less money than she had once been accustomed to. It was said that she was strongly interested in fame and fortune, and when household finances dwindled, she complained bitterly. Bunten wrote in her \"Life of Alice Barnham\"\u00a0 that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with Sir John Underhill, rewriting his will (which had generously planned to leave her lands, goods, and income) and revoking her entirely as a beneficiary.\nSexuality.\nSeveral authors believe that, despite his marriage, Bacon was primarily attracted to men. Forker, for example, has explored the \"historically documentable sexual preferences\" of both Francis Bacon and King James I and concluded they were both oriented to \"masculine love\", a contemporary term that \"seems to have been used exclusively to refer to the sexual preference of men for members of their own gender.\" Bacon's sexuality has been disputed by others, who point to lack of consistent evidence and consider the sources to be more open to interpretation.\nThe Jacobean antiquary and Bacon's fellow parliament member Sir Simonds D'Ewes implied there had been a question of bringing Bacon to trial for buggery, with which his brother Anthony Bacon had also been charged. (Bacon's brother \"apparently also was homosexual\", according to literature and sexuality scholar Joseph Cady.) In his \"Autobiography and Correspondence\" diary entry for 3 May 1621, the date of Bacon's censure by Parliament, D'Ewes describes Bacon's love for his Welsh serving-men, in particular his servant Mr. Henry Godrick or Goodrick, a \"very effeminate-faced youth\" whom he calls \"his catamite and bedfellow\". Bacon's own mother complained to Anthony on Bacon's affection for another servant of his, named Percy, whom she wrote Bacon kept as \"a coach companion and bed companion.\"\nIn his \"Brief Lives\" sketches (likely composed during 1665\u20131690 and published as a book in 1813), the antiquary John Aubrey wrote that Bacon was a pederast \"whose Ganimeds and Favourites tooke Bribes\". While pederast strictly denoted \"boy-lover\" in earlier times, Cady wrote that Aubrey deployed the term discreetly in the original Greek to signify \"male homosexual\". The figure of Ganymede, he continued, was another of many common ways of referring obliquely to homosexuality.\nIn \"New Atlantis\", Bacon described his utopian island as being \"the chastest nation under heaven\", with \"no touch\" of \"masculine love\". Cady argued that Bacon's reference to male homosexuality in the \"New Atlantis\" deliberately gave the appearance of coming from \"outside the phenomenon\" due to prevalent opposition. It contrasted deliberately with \"veiled\" praise of the topic elsewhere in Bacon's work, he asserted. Cady offered several examples, including that Bacon discussed only male beauty in his short essay \"Of Beauty\". He also noted that Bacon ended his monologue \"The Masculine Birth of Time\" with an older man asking a younger one (from his \"inmost heart\") to \"give yourself to me so that I may restore you to yourself\" and \"secure [you] an increase beyond all hopes and prayers of ordinary marriages\".\nDeath.\nOn 9 April 1626, Bacon died of pneumonia at Highgate outside London, specifically at Arundel House, a country residence of his friend the Earl of Arundel, though Arundel was then imprisoned in the Tower of London. An influential account of the circumstances of his death was given by John Aubrey's \"Brief Lives\". Aubrey's vivid account, which he says was told to him by \"Mr Hobbs\" (Thomas Hobbes), portrays Bacon as a martyr to experimental scientific method. It has him journeying to High-gate through the snow with the King's physician when he is suddenly inspired by the possibility that \"flesh [meat] might not be preserved in snow, as in Salt\":\nAfter stuffing the hen with snow, Bacon contracted a fatal case of pneumonia. Some people, including Aubrey, consider these two possibly coincidental events as related and causing his death:Aubrey has been criticized for his evident credulousness in this and other works; on the other hand, he knew Thomas Hobbes, Bacon's fellow-philosopher and friend.\nBeing unwittingly on his deathbed, the philosopher dictated his last letter to the Earl:\nAnother account appears in a biography by William Rawley, Bacon's personal secretary and chaplain:\nHe was buried in St Michael's Church in St Albans. At the news of his death, over 30 great minds collected together their eulogies of him, which were then later published in Latin. He left personal assets of about \u00a37,000 and lands that realised \u00a36,000 when sold. His debts amounted to more than \u00a323,000, equivalent to more than \u00a34m at current value.\nPhilosophy and works.\nFrancis Bacon's philosophy is displayed in the vast and varied writings he left, which might be divided into three great branches:\nInfluence and legacy.\nScience.\nBacon's seminal work the \"Novum Organum\" was highly influential in the 17th century among scholars, in particular Sir Thomas Browne, who in his encyclopedia \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\" (1646\u201372) frequently adheres to a Baconian approach to his scientific enquiries. This book entails the basis of the scientific method as a means of observation and induction. Also Robert Hooke was highly influenced by Bacon, using Baconian language and ideas in his book, \"Micrographia.\"\nAccording to Bacon, learning and knowledge all derive from inductive reasoning. Through his belief in experimentally-derived data, he theorised that all the knowledge that was necessary to fully understand a concept could be attained using induction. \"Induction\" in this context can be thought of as \"reasoning from evidence,\" as opposed to \"deduction,\" or \"top-down reasoning,\" which can be thought of as \"reasoning from a pre-existing premise, or hypothesis.\" In order to get to the point of an inductive conclusion, one must consider the importance of observing the particulars (specific parts of nature). \"Once these particulars have been gathered together, the interpretation of Nature proceeds by sorting them into a formal arrangement so that they may be presented to the understanding.\" Experimentation is essential to discovering the truths of Nature. When an experiment happens, the data is used to form a result and conclusion. Note that this process does not involve a pre-existing hypothesis. On the contrary, inductive reasoning starts with data, not a prior premise or hypothesis. Through this conclusion of particulars, an understanding of Nature can be formed. Now that an understanding of Nature has been arrived at, an inductive conclusion can be drawn. \"There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried.\" (Bacon's axiom XIX from the Novum Organum) \nBacon explains how we come to this understanding and knowledge because of this process in comprehending the complexities of nature. \"Bacon sees nature as an extremely subtle complexity, which affords all the energy of the natural philosopher to disclose her secrets.\" Bacon described the evidence and proof revealed through taking a specific example from nature and expanding that example into a general, substantial claim of nature. Once we understand the particulars in nature, we can learn more about it and become surer of things occurring in nature, gaining knowledge and obtaining new information all the while. \"It is nothing less than a revival of Bacon's supremely confident belief that inductive methods can provide us with ultimate and infallible answers concerning the laws and nature of the universe.\" Bacon states that when we come to understand parts of nature, we can eventually understand nature better as a whole because of induction. Because of this, Bacon concludes that all learning and knowledge must be drawn from inductive reasoning.\nDuring the Restoration, Bacon was commonly invoked as a guiding spirit of the Royal Society founded under Charles II in 1660. During the 18th-century French Enlightenment, Bacon's non-metaphysical approach to science became more influential than the dualism of his French contemporary Descartes, and was associated with criticism of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\". In 1733 Voltaire introduced him to a French audience as the \"father\" of the scientific method, an understanding which had become widespread by the 1750s. In the 19th century his emphasis on induction was revived and developed by William Whewell, among others. He has been reputed as the \"Father of Experimental Philosophy\".\nHe also wrote a long treatise on Medicine, \"History of Life and Death\", with natural and experimental observations for the prolongation of life.\nOne of his biographers, the historian William Hepworth Dixon, states: \"Bacon's influence in the modern world is so great that every man who rides in a train, sends a telegram, follows a steam plough, sits in an easy chair, crosses the channel or the Atlantic, eats a good dinner, enjoys a beautiful garden, or undergoes a painless surgical operation, owes him something.\"\nIn 1902 Hugo von Hofmannsthal published a fictional letter, known as \"The Lord Chandos Letter\", addressed to Bacon and dated 1603, about a writer who is experiencing a crisis of language.\nNorth America.\nBacon played a leading role in establishing the British colonies in North America, especially in Virginia, the Carolinas and Newfoundland in northeastern Canada. His government report on \"The Virginia Colony\" was submitted in 1609. In 1610 Bacon and his associates received a charter from the king to form \"the Tresurer and the Companye of Adventurers and planter of the Cittye of London and Bristoll for the Collonye or plantacon in Newfoundland\", and sent John Guy to found a colony there. Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, wrote: \"Bacon, Locke and Newton. I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences\".\nIn 1910, Newfoundland issued a postage stamp to commemorate Bacon's role in establishing the colony. The stamp describes Bacon as \"the guiding spirit in Colonization Schemes in 1610\". Moreover, some scholars believe he was largely responsible for the drafting, in 1609 and 1612, of two charters of government for the Virginia Colony. William Hepworth Dixon considered that Bacon's name could be included in the list of Founders of the United States.\nLaw.\nAlthough few of his proposals for law reform were adopted during his lifetime, Bacon's legal legacy was considered by the magazine \"New Scientist\" in 1961 as having influenced the drafting of the Napoleonic Code as well as the law reforms introduced by 19th-century British Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. The historian William Hepworth Dixon referred to the Napoleonic Code as \"the sole embodiment of Bacon's thought\", saying that Bacon's legal work \"has had more success abroad than it has found at home\", and that in France \"it has blossomed and come into fruit\".\nHarvey Wheeler attributed to Bacon, in \"Francis Bacon's Verulamiumthe Common Law Template of The Modern in English Science and Culture\", the creation of these distinguishing features of the modern common law system:\nAs late as the 18th century, some juries still declared the law rather than the facts, but already before the end of the 17th century Sir Matthew Hale explained modern common law adjudication procedure and acknowledged Bacon as the inventor of the process of discovering unwritten laws from the evidences of their applications. The method combined empiricism and inductivism in a new way that was to imprint its signature on many of the distinctive features of modern English society. Paul H. Kocher writes that Bacon is considered by some jurists to be the father of modern Jurisprudence.\nBacon is commemorated with a statue in Gray's Inn, South Square in London where he received his legal training, and where he was elected Treasurer of the Inn in 1608.\nMore recent scholarship on Bacon's jurisprudence has focused on his advocating torture as a legal recourse for the crown. Bacon himself was not a stranger to the torture chamber; in his various legal capacities in both Elizabeth I's and James I's reigns, Bacon was listed as a commissioner on five torture warrants. In 1613(?), in a letter addressed to King James I on the question of torture's place within English law, Bacon identifies the scope of torture as a means to further the investigation of threats to the state: \"In the cases of treasons, torture is used for discovery, and not for evidence.\" For Bacon, torture was not a punitive measure, an intended form of state repression, but instead offered a modus operandi for the government agent tasked with uncovering acts of treason.\nOrganization of knowledge.\nFrancis Bacon developed the idea that a classification of knowledge must be universal while handling all possible resources. In his progressive view, humanity would be better if access to educational resources were provided to the public, hence the need to organise it. His approach to learning reshaped the Western view of knowledge theory from an individual to a social interest.\nThe original classification proposed by Bacon organised all types of knowledge into three general groups: history, poetry, and philosophy. He did that based on his understanding of how information is processed: memory, imagination, and reason, respectively. His methodical approach to the categorization of knowledge goes hand-in-hand with his principles of scientific methods. Bacon's writings were the starting point for William Torrey Harris's classification system for libraries in the United States by the second half of the 1800s.\nThe phrase \" (or \"), meaning \"knowledge is power\", is commonly attributed to Bacon: the expression \"\" (\"knowledge itself is power\") occurs in his \"Meditationes Sacrae\" (1597).\nHistorical debates.\nBacon and Shakespeare.\nThe Baconian hypothesis of Shakespearean authorship, first proposed in the mid-19th century, contends that Francis Bacon wrote some or even all of the plays conventionally attributed to William Shakespeare.\nOccult theories.\nFrancis Bacon often gathered with the men at Gray's Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing. Bacon's alleged connection to the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books. However, others, including Daphne du Maurier in her biography of Bacon, have argued that there is no substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians. Frances Yates does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's \"New Atlantis\" portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.\nThe link between Bacon's work and the Rosicrucians' ideals which Yates allegedly found was the conformity of the purposes expressed by the Rosicrucian Manifestos and Bacon's plan of a \"Great Instauration\", for the two were calling for a reformation of both \"divine and human understanding\", as well as both, had in view the purpose of mankind's return to the \"state before the Fall\".\nAnother major link is said to be the resemblance between Bacon's \"New Atlantis\" and the German Rosicrucian Johann Valentin Andreae's \"Description of the Republic of Christianopolis\" (1619). Andreae describes a utopic island in which Christian theosophy and applied science ruled, and in which the spiritual fulfilment and intellectual activity constituted the primary goals of each individual, the scientific pursuits being the highest intellectual callinglinked to the achievement of spiritual perfection. Andreae's island also depicts a great advancement in technology, with many industries separated in different zones which supplied the population's needswhich shows great resemblance to Bacon's scientific methods and purposes.\nWhile rejecting occult conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and the claim Bacon personally identified as a Rosicrucian, intellectual historian Paolo Rossi has argued for an occult influence on Bacon's scientific and religious writing. He argues that Bacon was familiar with early modern alchemical texts and that Bacon's ideas about the application of science had roots in Renaissance magical ideas about science and magic facilitating humanity's domination of nature. Rossi further interprets Bacon's search for hidden meanings in myth and fables in such texts as \"The Wisdom of the Ancients\" as succeeding earlier occultist and Neoplatonic attempts to locate hidden wisdom in pre-Christian myths. As indicated by the title of his study, however, Rossi claims Bacon ultimately rejected the philosophical foundations of occultism as he came to develop a form of modern science.\nRossi's analysis and claims have been extended by Jason Josephson-Storm in his study, \"The Myth of Disenchantment\". Josephson-Storm also rejects conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and does not make the claim that Bacon was an active Rosicrucian. However, he argues that Bacon's \"rejection\" of magic actually constituted an attempt to purify magic of Catholic, demonic, and esoteric influences and to establish magic as a field of study and application paralleling Bacon's vision of science. Furthermore, Josephson-Storm argues that Bacon drew on magical ideas when developing his experimental method. Josephson-Storm finds evidence that Bacon considered nature a living entity, populated by spirits, and argues Bacon's views on the human domination and application of nature actually depend on his spiritualism and personification of nature.\nBacon's influence can also be seen on a variety of religious and spiritual authors, and on groups that have utilized his writings in their own belief systems.\nBibliography.\nSome of the more notable works by Bacon are:\nExternal links.\n \n \n "}

{"id": "11345", "revid": "11112747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11345", "title": "Snap (gridiron football)", "text": "A snap (also called a \"hike\", \"snapback\", or \"pass from center\") is the backward passing of the ball in gridiron football at the start of play from scrimmage.\nAction.\nThe ball begins on the ground with its long axis parallel to the sidelines of the field, its ends marking each team's line of scrimmage in American football; in Canadian football, the line of scrimmage of the team without the ball is 1 yard past their side of the ball. The player snapping the ball (known officially as the \"snapper\" in rule books) delivers the ball to another player, and that action is the snap. The snapper may hand, throw, or even roll the ball to the other player. The snap must be a quick and continuous movement of the ball by one or both hands of the snapper, and the ball must leave the snapper's hands. The various rules codes have additional requirements, all of which have the effect of requiring the ball to go backward. The snapper almost always passes the ball between his legs, but only in Canadian football is that required.\nIn the standard gridiron football formation, the center/centre is the snapper and is situated in the middle of the line of scrimmage. Only in arena football is the center required by rule to be the snapper. In other codes, a guard, tackle, running back, tight end or split end can legally deliver the snap; such scenarios, known as an \"unbalanced line\", are seldom used outside of trick plays and novelties.\nFor a handed snap, the snapper will usually have his head up, facing opponents. For a thrown snap, especially in formations wherein the ball may be snapped to players in different positions, the snapper will commonly bend over looking between his legs. Because of the vulnerability of a player in such a position, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Federation of State High School Associations (\"Fed\") have adopted rules providing that if a player is positioned at least seven yards behind the neutral zone to receive a snap, opponents are not to deliberately contact the snapper until one second after the snap (NCAA), or until the snapper has a chance to react (Fed). However, in professional football it is common for a center to be able to practice a single \"shotgun\" formation thrown snap enough to keep his head up and toss it blindly.\nA snap is considered a backward pass, therefore if the ball is snapped and it hits the ground without any player gaining control of the ball the play is ruled as a fumble.\nSnap count.\nThe team entitled to snap the ball will usually know in advance the moment when the snap is to occur as one of their players calls out signals, which usually include a loud sound such as \"hut\" voiced one or more times, the number of which they know; they are thus said to know the \"snap count\". Therefore, they have a considerable advantage over their opponents. The center is not, however, allowed to make motions simulating part of the snap-action; therefore their opponents can be confident the first motion of the ball or the center's hands is the beginning of the snap.\nThe snap count is decided on in the huddle, usually expressed as \"...on &lt;number&gt;.\" being the final words spoken by the quarterback after calling the play but before the huddle breaks and the players go to the line of scrimmage. The snap count allows offensive players to have a small head start. The defensive players want to predict the snap, and build up speed such that they cross the line of scrimmage exactly as the play begins, to increase their chances of getting a tackle for a loss or a sack. By varying the snap count, a quarterback forces the defensive players to react to the movement of the offensive players, or risk being called for an offsides or encroachment penalty. Unfortunately for the offense, this advantage can sometimes become a disadvantage. When faced with an exceptionally loud stadium, players may be unable to hear the snap count and are forced to concentrate more on visual cues (silent snap count or a hard count), or risk false start penalties.\nThe offense must also be mindful of the play clock. If they fail to snap the ball in time they incur a delay of game penalty. Also, with a dwindling play clock, the defense has better chances of guessing when the ball will be snapped. It is easier to predict when the ball will be snapped with 2 seconds left on the play clock, rather than 5 seconds.\nThe defensive team is not allowed to simulate, by calling out numbers, the offense's snap count. Successfully simulating the count would cause members of the offensive team to act too early ruining co-ordination of the play and inviting penalties. Current rules, unlike earlier rules, position officials so far from the line of scrimmage for 50 minutes of the 60-minute game that it is extremely difficult to hear if the defense is simulating the count.\nHistory and rationale.\nThe snap, the set scrum and ruck in today's rugby union, and the play-the-ball in rugby league have common origins in rugby football. As the rules of rugby's scrimmage were written when the game came to North America, they had a significant flaw which was corrected by custom elsewhere, but by the invention of the snap in American football.\nThe rule adopted by a committee for American football in 1880 first provided for the uncontested right of one side to play the ball by foot (in any direction) for a scrimmage. A certain use of the foot on the ball which had the same effect as heeling it back was known as a \"snap\". Later in the 19th century, the option of snapping the ball back by hand was added. The option to play the ball with the foot was preserved, however, for several decades, although by early in the 20th century it was restricted to kicking the ball forward. The kick forward in scrimmage was a surprise play that did not work against a prepared defense. Also for several decades alternatives to the scrimmage for playing the ball from across the sideline after it had gone out of bounds\u2014a throw-in or \"fair\", and \"bounding in\"\u2014existed. Until well into the 20th century, rather than an official readying the ball for scrimmage, the side entitled to the snap had complete custody of the ball and could snap it from the required spot at any time; for instance, a tackled ball carrier might feign injury, then suddenly snap the ball while recumbent, there being no stance requirement yet. The neutral zone and the right of the center not to be contacted by an opponent before the snap also was not an original feature. As the 20th century drew to a close, the NCAA and National Federation of State High School Associations extended that protection to some time the snap, in cases where a player is positioned at least 7 yards deep to receive a thrown snap.\nCanadian football used the rugby scrimmage unaltered until near the end of the 19th century, when, regionally at first, under the influence of the American scrimmage, the number of players in the scrimmage was limited to three\u2014a \"centre scrimmager\" bound on either side by props called \"side scrimmagers\". The centre scrimmager was later renamed the \"snap\", and in intercollegiate play one side was given the right to put foot to ball first. Beginning regionally again and universally by 1923, the Burnside rules led to the three-man scrimmage being reduced to the centre alone, the number of players on the field being reduced commensurately from 14 to 12, and a snap rule and neutral zone similar to that of American football was adopted. In addition to the between-the-legs requirement noted above, for several years after the adoption of the hand snap, a hand-to-hand snap was illegal, the ball required to be thrown instead, in Canadian football. (Though it was technically legal, the hand-to-hand snap was not used on the American side of the border until the 1930s.) Apparently, a complete break was desired from system of backheeling, and the T formation having gone into eclipse in American football at the time, the Canadian snap was modeled on the formations then in common use in the US, such as the single-wing formation.\nThe game design rationale for requiring the snap to be a quick and continuous motion to the backfield is to eliminate the need for rules provisions for a live ball in scrimmage. In rugby union the ball may be retained by the forwards and played for a time via the foot in a scrummage (which rugby league has as well) or ruck, or by the hands in a maul, necessitating additional restrictions on play and player positioning during those intervals. In American and Canadian football, the ball as it is put in play is only held in the line (by the center) for a fraction of a second. The uncontested possession also, as Walter Camp pointed out, allows for better offensive and defensive planning by the side entitled to snap the ball and their opposition, respectively. A muffed snap can be recovered by either team."}

{"id": "11347", "revid": "44120587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11347", "title": "FIFO (computing and electronics)", "text": "In computing and in systems theory, first in, first out (the first in is the first out), acronymized as FIFO, is a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure (often, specifically a data buffer) where the oldest (first) entry, or \"head\" of the queue, is processed first.\nSuch processing is analogous to servicing people in a queue area on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) basis, i.e. in the same sequence in which they arrive at the queue's tail.\nFCFS is also the jargon term for the FIFO operating system scheduling algorithm, which gives every process central processing unit (CPU) time in the order in which it is demanded. FIFO's opposite is LIFO, last-in-first-out, where the youngest entry or \"top of the stack\" is processed first. A priority queue is neither FIFO or LIFO but may adopt similar behaviour temporarily or by default. Queueing theory encompasses these methods for processing data structures, as well as interactions between strict-FIFO queues.\nComputer science.\nDepending on the application, a FIFO could be implemented as a hardware shift register, or using different memory structures, typically a circular buffer or a kind of list. For information on the abstract data structure, see Queue (data structure). Most software implementations of a FIFO queue are not thread safe and require a locking mechanism to verify the data structure chain is being manipulated by only one thread at a time.\nThe following code shows a linked list FIFO C++ language implementation. In practice, a number of list implementations exist, including popular Unix systems C sys/queue.h macros or the C++ standard library std::list template, avoiding the need for implementing the data structure from scratch.\nusing namespace std;\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass FIFO {\n struct Node {\n T value;\n shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; next = nullptr;\n shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; front = nullptr;\n shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; back = nullptr;\npublic:\n void enqueue(T _value) {\n if (front == nullptr) {\n front = make_shared&lt;Node&gt;(_value);\n back = front;\n } else {\n back-&gt;next = make_shared&lt;Node&gt;(_value);\n back = back-&gt;next;\n T dequeue() {\n if (front == nullptr)\n throw underflow_error(\"Nothing to dequeue\");\n T value = front-&gt;value;\n front = move(front-&gt;next);\n return value;\n};\nIn computing environments that support the pipes-and-filters model for interprocess communication, a FIFO is another name for a named pipe.\nDisk controllers can use the FIFO as a disk scheduling algorithm to determine the order in which to service disk I/O requests, where it is also known by the same FCFS initialism as for CPU scheduling mentioned before.\nCommunication network bridges, switches and routers used in computer networks use FIFOs to hold data packets in route to their next destination. Typically at least one FIFO structure is used per network connection. Some devices feature multiple FIFOs for simultaneously and independently queuing different types of information.\nElectronics.\nFIFOs are commonly used in electronic circuits for buffering and flow control between hardware and software. In its hardware form, a FIFO primarily consists of a set of read and write pointers, storage and control logic. Storage may be static random access memory (SRAM), flip-flops, latches or any other suitable form of storage. For FIFOs of non-trivial size, a dual-port SRAM is usually used, where one port is dedicated to writing and the other to reading.\nThe first known FIFO implemented in electronics was by Peter Alfke in 1969 at Fairchild Semiconductor. Alfke was later a director at Xilinx.\nSynchronicity.\nA synchronous FIFO is a FIFO where the same clock is used for both reading and writing. An asynchronous FIFO uses different clocks for reading and writing and they can introduce metastability issues. A common implementation of an asynchronous FIFO uses a Gray code (or any unit distance code) for the read and write pointers to ensure reliable flag generation. One further note concerning flag generation is that one must necessarily use pointer arithmetic to generate flags for asynchronous FIFO implementations. Conversely, one may use either a leaky bucket approach or pointer arithmetic to generate flags in synchronous FIFO implementations.\nA hardware FIFO is used for synchronization purposes. It is often implemented as a circular queue, and thus has two pointers:\nStatus flags.\nExamples of FIFO status flags include: full, empty, almost full, and almost empty. A FIFO is empty when the read address register reaches the write address register. A FIFO is full when the write address register reaches the read address register. Read and write addresses are initially both at the first memory location and the FIFO queue is \"empty\".\nIn both cases, the read and write addresses end up being equal. To distinguish between the two situations, a simple and robust solution is to add one extra bit for each read and write address which is inverted each time the address wraps.

Firewalls are built between or through buildings, structures, or electrical substation transformers, or within an aircraft or vehicle.\nApplications.\nFirewalls can be used to subdivide a building into separate fire areas and are constructed in accordance with the locally applicable building codes. Firewalls are a portion of a building's passive fire protection systems.\nFirewalls can be used to separate-high value transformers at an electrical substation in the event of a mineral oil tank rupture and ignition. The firewall serves as a fire containment wall between one oil-filled transformer and other neighboring transformers, building structures, and site equipment.\nTypes.\nThere are three main classifications of \"fire rated walls\": fire walls, fire barriers, and fire partitions. \nFire barrier walls are typically continuous from an exterior wall to an exterior wall, or from a floor below to a floor or roof above, or from one fire barrier wall to another fire barrier wall, having a fire resistance rating equal to or greater than the required rating for the application. Fire barriers are continuous through concealed spaces (e.g., above a ceiling) to the floor deck or roof deck above the barrier. Fire partitions are not required to extend through concealed spaces if the construction assembly forming the bottom of the concealed space, such as the ceiling, has a fire resistance rating at least equal to or greater than the fire partition.\nPortions of structures that are subdivided by fire walls are permitted to be considered separate buildings, in that fire walls have sufficient structural stability to maintain the integrity of the wall in the event of the collapse of the building construction on either side of the wall.\nPerformance based design.\nFirewalls are used in varied applications that require specific design and performance specifications. Knowing the potential conditions that may exist during a fire are critical to selecting and installing an effective firewall. For example, a firewall designed to meet National Fire Protection Agency, (NFPA), 221-09 section A.5.7 which indicates an average temperature of , is not designed to withstand higher temperatures such as would be present in higher challenge fires, and as a result would fail to function for the expected duration of the listed wall rating.\nPerformance based design takes into account the potential conditions during a fire. Understanding thermal limitations of materials is essential to using the correct material for the application. Laboratory testing is used to simulate fire scenarios and wall loading conditions.

{"id": "11353", "revid": "41906662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11353", "title": "Frigg", "text": "Frigg (; Old Norse: ) is a goddess, one of the \u00c6sir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as ', in Langobardic as ', in Old English as ', in Old Frisian as Fr\u012ba, and in Old Saxon as ', all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *\"Frijj\u014d\". Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.\nIn Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hl\u00edn, Gn\u00e1, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity J\u00f6r\u00f0 (Old Norse: 'Earth'). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god Baldr.\nThe English weekday name Friday (ultimately meaning 'Frigg's Day') bears her name. After Christianization, the mention of Frigg continued to occur in Scandinavian folklore. During modern times, Frigg has appeared in popular culture, has been the subject of art and receives veneration in Germanic Neopaganism.\nName and origin.\nEtymology.\nThe theonyms \"Frigg\" (Old Norse), \"Fr\u012bja\" (Old High German), \"Fr\u012bg\" (Old English), \"Fr\u012ba\" (Old Frisian), and \"Fr\u012b\" (Old Saxon) are cognates (linguistic siblings from the same origin). They stem from the Proto-Germanic feminine noun \"*Frijj\u014d\", which emerged as a substantivized form of the adjective *\"frijaz\" ('free') via Holtzmann's law. In a clan-based societal system, the meaning 'free' arose from the meaning 'related'. The name is indeed etymologically close to the Sanskrit \"priy\u0101\" and the Avestan \"fry\u0101\" ('own, dear, beloved'), all ultimately descending from the Proto-Indo-European stem *\"priH-o-\", denoting 'one's own, beloved'. The Proto-Germanic verb \"*frij\u014dnan\" ('to love'), as well as the nouns *\"frij\u014dndz\" ('friend') and *\"frija\u0111w\u014d\" ('friendship, peace'), are also related.\nAn -a suffix has been sometimes applied by modern editors to denote femininity, resulting in the form \"Frigga\". This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word \"frig\", with a primary meaning of masturbate or to the common alternative to the English profanity \"fuck\". Several place names refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.\nOrigin of Frigg.\nThe connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period is a matter of scholarly debate (see Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis). Like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir, the name \"Freyja\" is not attested outside of Scandinavia. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess \"Frigg\", who is also attested as a goddess among West Germanic peoples. Evidence is lacking for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse \"Freyja\" descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.\nRegarding the Freyja\u2013Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy writes that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"\nOrigin of \"Friday\".\nThe English weekday name \"Friday\" comes from Old English \"Fr\u012b\u0121ed\u00e6\u0121\", meaning 'day of Frig'. It is cognate with Old Frisian \"Fr\u012badei\" (\u2248 \"Fri(g)endei\"), Middle Dutch \"Vridach\" (\u2248 \"Vriendach\"), Middle Low German \"Vr\u012bdach\" (\u2248 \"Vr\u012bgedach\"), and Old High German \"Fr\u00eeatac\". The Old Norse \"Frj\u00e1dagr\" was borrowed from a West Germanic language. All of these terms derive from Late Proto-Germanic *\"Frijj\u014ddag\" ('Day of Frijj\u014d'), a calque of Latin \"Veneris dies\" ('Day of Venus'; cf. modern Italian \"venerd\u00ec\", French \"vendredi\", Spanish \"viernes\").\nThe Germanic goddess' name has substituted for the Roman name of a comparable deity, a practice known as \"interpretatio germanica\". Although the Old English theonym \"Fr\u012bg\" is only found in the name of the weekday, it is also attested as a common noun in \"fr\u012bg\" ('love, affections [plural], embraces [in poetry]'). The Old Norse weekday \"Freyjudagr\", a rare synonym of \"Frj\u00e1dagr\", saw the replacement of the first element with the genitive of \"Freyja\".\nAttestations.\n\"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\" and \"Historia Langobardorum\".\nThe 7th-century \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\", and Paul the Deacon's 8th-century \"Historia Langobardorum\" derived from it, recount a founding myth of the Langobards, a Germanic people who ruled a region of what is now Italy (see Lombardy). According to this legend, a \"small people\" known as the \"Winnili\" were ruled by a woman named Gambara who had two sons, Ybor and Agio. The Vandals, ruled by Ambri and Assi, came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Agio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambra and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the \"Origo\"): \"Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory.\"\nMeanwhile, Ybor and Agio called upon Frea, Godan's wife. Frea counseled them that \"at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands\". At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili, including their whiskered women, and asked \"who are those Long-beards?\" Frea responded to Godan, \"As you have given them a name, give them also the victory\". Godan did so, \"so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory\". Thenceforth the Winnili were known as the \"Langobards\" (Langobardic \"long-beards\").\nSecond Merseburg Incantation.\nA 10th-century manuscript found in what is now Merseburg, Germany, features an invocation known as the Second Merseburg Incantation. The incantation calls upon various continental Germanic gods, including Old High German Frija and a goddess associated with her\u2014Volla, to assist in healing a horse:\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled during the 13th century from earlier traditional material, Frigg is mentioned in the poems \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", \"Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l\", the prose of \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", \"Lokasenna\", and \"Oddr\u00fanargr\u00e1tr\".\nFrigg receives three mentions in the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\". In the first mention the poem recounts that Frigg wept for the death of her son Baldr in Fensalir. Later in the poem, when the future death of Odin is foretold, Odin is referred to as the \"beloved of Frigg\" and his future death is referred to as the \"second grief of Frigg\". Like the reference to Frigg weeping in Fensalir earlier in the poem, the implied \"first grief\" is a reference to the grief she felt upon the death of her son, Baldr.\nFrigg plays a prominent role in the prose introduction to the poem, \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\". The introduction recounts that two sons of king Hrau\u00f0ungr, Agnar (age 10) and Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r (age 8), once sailed out with a trailing line to catch small fish, but wind drove them out into the ocean and, during the darkness of night, their boat wrecked. The brothers went ashore, where they met a crofter. They stayed on the croft for one winter, during which the couple separately fostered the two children: the old woman fostered Agnar and the old man fostered Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r. Upon the arrival of spring, the old man brought them a ship. The old couple took the boys to the shore, and the old man took Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r aside and spoke to him. The boys entered the boat and a breeze came.\nThe boat returned to the harbor of their father. Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r, forward in the ship, jumped to shore and pushed the boat, containing his brother, out and said \"go where an evil spirit may get thee.\" Away went the ship and Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r walked to a house, where he was greeted with joy; while the boys were gone, their father had died, and now Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r was king. He \"became a splendid man.\" The scene switches to Odin and Frigg sitting in Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, \"look[ing] into all the worlds.\" Odin says: \"'Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children a giantess [Old Norse \"g\u0233gi\"] in a cave? while Geirr\u00f6d, my foster son, is a king residing in his country.' Frigg answered, 'He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come.'\"\nOdin replied that this was a great untruth and so the two made a wager. Frigg sent her \"waiting-maid\" Fulla to warn Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r to be wary, lest a wizard who seeks him should harm him, and that he would know this wizard by the refusal of dogs, no matter how ferocious, to attack the stranger. While it was not true that Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r was inhospitable with his guests, Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r did as instructed and had the wizard arrested. Upon being questioned, the wizard, wearing a blue cloak, said no more than that his name is \"Gr\u00edmnir\". Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r has Gr\u00edmnir tortured and sits him between two fires for 8 nights. Upon the 9th night, Gr\u00edmnir is brought a full drinking horn by Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r's son, Agnar (so named after Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r's brother), and the poem continues without further mention or involvement of Frigg.\nIn the poem \"Lokasenna\", where Loki accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between the god Loki and the goddess Frigg (and thereafter between Loki and the goddess Freyja about Frigg). A prose introduction to the poem describes that numerous gods and goddesses attended a banquet held by \u00c6gir. These gods and goddesses include Odin and, \"his wife\", Frigg.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nFrigg is mentioned throughout the \"Prose Edda\", compiled in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Frigg is first mentioned in the \"Prose Edda\" Prologue, wherein a euhemerized account of the Norse gods is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of folk etymology, the author attempts to associate the name \"Frigg\" with the Latin-influenced form \"Frigida\". The Prologue adds that both Frigg and Odin \"had the gift of prophecy.\"\nIn the next section of the \"Prose Edda\", \"Gylfaginning\", High tells Gangleri (the king Gylfi in disguise) that Frigg, daughter of Fj\u00f6rgynn (Old Norse \"Fj\u00f6rgynsd\u00f3ttir\") is married to Odin and that the \u00c6sir are descended from the couple, and adds that \"the earth [\"J\u00f6r\u00f0in\"] was [Odin's] daughter and his wife.\" According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god Thor.\nLater in \"Gylfaginning\", Gangleri asks about the \"\u00e1synjur\", a term for Norse goddesses. High says that \"highest\" among them is Frigg and that only Freyja \"is highest in rank next to her.\" Frigg dwells in Fensalir \"and it is very splendid.\" In this section of \"Gylfaginning\", Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other \"\u00e1synjur\": Fulla carries Frigg's ashen box, \"looks after her footwear and shares her secrets;\" Lofn is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to \"arrange unions\" among men and women; Hl\u00edn is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deem worthy of keeping from danger; and Gn\u00e1 is sent by Frigg \"into various worlds to carry out her business.\"\nIn section 49 of \"Gylfaginning\", a narrative about the fate of Frigg's son Baldr is told. According to High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his fellow \u00c6sir about his dreams, the gods met together for a thing and decided that they should \"request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger.\" Frigg subsequently receives promises from the elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request successful, the \u00c6sir make sport of Baldr's newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained unharmed. However, Loki discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.\nThere, Frigg asks this female visitor what the \u00c6sir are up to assembled at the thing. The woman says that all of the \u00c6sir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that \"Weapons and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all.\" The woman asks Frigg if all things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; \"there grows a shoot of a tree to the west of Val-hall. It is called mistletoe. It seemed young to me to demand the oath from.\" Loki immediately disappears.\nNow armed with mistletoe, Loki arrives at the thing where the \u00c6sir are assembled and tricks the blind H\u00f6\u00f0r, Baldr's brother, into shooting Baldr with a mistletoe projectile. To the horror of the assembled gods, the mistletoe goes directly through Baldr, killing him. Standing in horror and shock, the gods are initially only able to weep due to their grief. Frigg speaks up and asks \"who there was among the \u00c6sir who wished to earn all her love and favour and was willing to ride the road to Hel and try if he could find Baldr, and offer Hel a ransom if she would let Baldr go back to Asgard.\"\nHerm\u00f3\u00f0r, Baldr's brother, accepts Frigg's request and rides to Hel. Meanwhile, Baldr is given a grand funeral attended by many beings\u2014foremost mentioned of which are his mother and father, Frigg and Odin. During the funeral, Nanna dies of grief and is placed in the funeral pyre with Baldr, her dead husband. Herm\u00f3\u00f0r locates Baldr and Nanna in Hel. Hermodr secures an agreement for the return of Baldr and with Herm\u00f3\u00f0r Nanna sends gifts to Frigg (a linen robe) and Fulla (a finger-ring). Herm\u00f3\u00f0r rides back to the \u00c6sir and tells them what has happened. However, the agreement fails due to the sabotage of a j\u00f6tunn in a cave named \u00de\u00f6kk (Old Norse 'thanks'), described as perhaps Loki in disguise.\nFrigg is mentioned several times in the \"Prose Edda\" section \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\". The first mention occurs at the beginning of the section, where the \u00c6sir and \u00c1synjur are said to have once held a banquet in a hall in a land of gods, Asgard. Frigg is one of the twelve \u00e1synjur in attendance.\n\"Heimskringla\" and sagas.\nIn \"Ynglinga saga\", the first book of \"Heimskringla\", a Euhemerized account of the origin of the gods is provided. Frigg is mentioned once. According to the saga, while Odin was away, Odin's brothers Vili and V\u00e9 oversaw Odin's holdings. Once, while Odin was gone for an extended period, the \u00c6sir concluded that he was not coming back. His brothers started to divvy up Odin's inheritance, \"but his wife Frigg they shared between them. However, a short while afterwards, [Odin] returned and took possession of his wife again.\nIn \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\", the great king Rerir and his wife (unnamed) are unable to conceive a child; \"that lack displeased them both, and they fervently implored the gods that they might have a child. It is said that Frigg heard their prayers and told Odin what they asked.\"\nArchaeological record.\nA 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the Schleswig Cathedral in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a distaff. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.\nScholarly reception and interpretation.\nDue to numerous similarities, some scholars have proposed that the Old Norse goddesses Frigg and Freyja descend from a common entity from the Proto-Germanic period. Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"\nUnlike Frigg but like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir, the name \"Freyja\" is not attested outside of Scandinavia, as opposed to the name of the goddess \"Frigg\", who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *\"Frijj\u014d\". Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which \"Freyja\" descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of evidence outside of the North Germanic record.\nModern influence.\nFrigg is referenced in art and literature into the modern period. In the 18th century, Gustav III of Sweden, king of Sweden, composed \"Friggja\", a play, so named after the goddess, and H. F. Block and Hans Friedrich Blunck's \"Frau Frigg und Doktor Faust\" in 1937. Other examples include fine art works by K. Ehrenberg (\"Frigg, Freyja\", drawing, 1883), John Charles Dollman (\"Frigga Spinning the Clouds\", painting, c. 1900), Emil Doepler (\"Wodan und Frea am Himmelsfenster\", painting, 1901), and H. Thoma (\"Fricka\", drawing, date not provided)."}

Wankel joined various radical antisemitic organizations after World War I and was a prominent member of the Nazi Party.\nEarly life.\nWankel was born in 1902 in Lahr in what was then the Grand Duchy of Baden in the Upper Rhine Plain of present-day southwestern Germany. He was the only son of Gerty Wankel (n\u00e9e Heidlauff) and Rudolf Wankel, a forest assessor. His father died in World War I. Thereafter, the family moved to Heidelberg. He went to high schools in Donaueschingen, Heidelberg, and Weinheim, and left school without Abitur in 1921. He learned the trade of purchaser at the Carl Winter Press in Heidelberg and worked for the publishing house until June 1926. He and some friends had already run an unofficial afterwork machine shop in a backyard shed in Heidelberg since 1924. Wankel was now determined to receive unemployment benefits and to focus on the machine shop. One of his friends, who had graduated from university, gave his name and transformed the shop into an official garage for DKW and Cleveland motor bikes in 1927, where Wankel worked from time to time until his arrest in 1933.\nWankel was gifted since childhood with an ingenious spatial imagination and became interested in the world of machines, especially combustion engines. After his mother was widowed, Wankel could not afford university education or even an apprenticeship. He was, however, able to teach himself technical subjects. At age 17 he told friends that he had dreamt of constructing a car with \"a new type of engine, half turbine, half reciprocating. It is my invention!\". True to this prediction, he conceived the Wankel engine in 1924 and won his first patent in 1929.\nWankel and the Nazi Party.\nDuring the early 1920s Wankel was a member of various radical anti-Semitic organizations. In 1921 he joined the Heidelberg branch of the Deutschv\u00f6lkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund and in 1922 he became a member of the NSDAP, the National Socialist German Workers Party (or \"Nazi Party\"), which was banned soon afterwards. Wankel founded and led youth groups associated with a cover-up organization of the NSDAP. With them he conducted paramilitary training, scouting games and night walks. When his high esteem for technical innovations was not widely shared among the German Youth Movement, he was offered instead the opportunity to talk about the issue of technology and education to Adolf Hitler and other leading National Socialists in 1928.\nIn the meantime Wankel's mother, Gerty had helped founding the local chapter of the NSDAP in his hometown of Lahr. Here Wankel not only rejoined the party in 1926, but also met the local Gauleiter, i.e. regional head of the NSDAP party, Robert Heinrich Wagner. In 1931 Wagner entrusted Wankel with the leadership of the Hitler Youth in Baden. But they soon fell out with each other, because Wankel tried to put a stronger emphasis on military training, whereas Wagner wished for the Hitler Youth to be a primarily political organization. In a particularly bitter and ugly controversy Wankel publicly accused Wagner of corruption. Wagner retaliated by stripping Wankel of his office by early 1932 and managed to have him expelled from the party in October 1932.\nWankel, who sympathized with the social-revolutionary wing of the NSDAP with Gregor Strasser, then founded his own National Socialist splinter group in Lahr and continued his attacks on Wagner. Since the Nazis' seizure of power on 30 January 1933 had strengthened his position, Wagner had Wankel arrested and imprisoned in the Lahr jail in March 1933. Only by intervention of Hitler's economic adviser Wilhelm Keppler and Hitler himself, was Wankel set free in September 1933. A fellow native of Baden and member of Reichstag from 1933 to 1945, Keppler had been a friend of Wankel and an ardent supporter of his technological endeavors since 1927. He now helped Wankel to get state contracts and his own \"Wankels Versuchs Werkst\u00e4tten\" experimental workshop in Lindau.\nWankel tried to rejoin the NSDAP in 1937, but was turned down. With the help of Keppler, however, he was admitted to the SS in 1940 in the rank of Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer. Two years later his membership was revoked for unknown reasons.\nCareer.\nDuring World War II, Wankel developed seals and rotary valves for German air force aircraft and navy torpedoes, as well as for companies such as BMW and Daimler-Benz. After the war, the region was occupied by France. Wankel was imprisoned by French authorities for several months in 1945 and his laboratory was closed by French occupation troops. Wankel's work was confiscated and he was prohibited from doing any more work. However, by 1951, he got funding from the Goetze AG company to furnish the new Technical Development Center in his privately owned house in Lindau on Lake Constance. He began development of the engine at NSU Motorenwerke AG, leading to the first running prototype on 1 February 1957. Unlike modern Wankel engines, this 21 horsepower version had both the rotor and housing rotating. His engine design was first licensed by Curtiss-Wright in New Jersey, United States.\nOn 19 January 1960 the rotary engine was presented for the first time to specialists and the press in a meeting of the German Engineers' Union at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. In the same year, with the KKM 250, the first practically applied rotary engine was presented in a converted NSU Prinz automobile. At around this time the term \"Wankel engine\" became synonymous with the rotary type of engine, whereas previously it was referred to as the \"Motor nach System NSU/Wankel\". At the 1963 IAA motor show in Frankfurt, the NSU company presented the NSU Wankel-Spider, the first consumer vehicle with a rotary engine, which went into production in 1964. Great attention was received by the NSU in August 1967 for the very modern NSU Ro 80 sedan, which had a 115-horsepower engine with two rotors. It was the first German car named \"Car of the Year\" in 1968. \nIn Japan, the manufacturer Mazda licensed the engine and successfully solved various problems relating to chatter marks. The engine was used successfully by Mazda in several generations of their RX-series of coup\u00e9s and sedans, including the Mazda Cosmo (1967), R100 (1968), the RX-7 (1978\u20132002), and the RX-8 (2003\u20132012). Mazda has planned to reintroduce the engine, albeit as a range extender, in their MX-30 R-EV in 2023. Mercedes-Benz fitted one of its C111 experimental models in 1969 with a three-rotor Wankel engine. In 1970, the next model had a four-rotor Wankel engine and could reach top speed 290\u00a0km/h but never reached production.\nWankel became a success in business by securing license agreements for the engine to manufacturers around the world. By 1958 Wankel and partners had founded the Wankel GmbH company, providing Wankel with a share of the profits for marketing the engine. Among the licensees were Daimler-Benz since 1961, General Motors since 1970, Toyota since 1971. Among those who paid higher fees for Wankel RCE rights was a state-owned engineering firm of the DDR. Royalties received by Wankel's own company from licensing were 40% at first, which later dropped to 36%. In 1971 Wankel sold his share in licensing royalties for 50 million Deutschmarks (adjusted for inflation, approximately \u20ac87m in 2021) to the English conglomerate Lonrho. A year later he got his Technical Development Center back from the Fraunhofer Society research organization. From 1986 the Felix Wankel Institute entered cooperation agreement with Daimler Benz, which covered the institute's operating costs in return for research rights. Wankel later sold the institute to Daimler Benz for 100 million Deutschmarks.\nIn the context of the developed Wankel engine, \"rotary\" is something of a misnomer. The Wankel principle applied only to a \"rotary piston\" and not to the engine as a whole which was a stationary assembly, unlike rotary engines employed in WW1 aircraft in which the entire engine rotated about a fixed crankshaft.\nPersonal life.\nWankel married Emma \"Mi\" Kirn in 1936. Though married for life, they had no children. She died in 1975.\nHe never had a driving license, because he was extremely near-sighted. He was, however, the owner of an NSU Ro 80 with a Wankel engine, which was chauffeur driven for him.\nIn 1969, Wankel was granted an honorary Doctorate of Engineering from Technical University Munich. He was known for his championing of animal rights and opposition to the use of animals in testing.\nWankel died in Heidelberg in October 1988, aged 86. His grave is in the Bergfriedhof of Heidelberg.\nAfter his death, the Felix Wankel Foundation sold its real estate property to Volkswagen AG. The Heidelberg Fire Department showcases his last workshop. Wankel's papers are archived in the Technoseum in Mannheim. Furthermore, there is an exhibition \"AUTOVISION \u00b7 Tradition &amp; Forum\" in Altlu\u00dfheim, a permanent showing of over 80 rotary engines and many cars equipped with Wankel motors."}

{"id": "11367", "revid": "19404073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11367", "title": "Fourth-generation programming language", "text": "A fourth-generation programming language (4GL) is a high-level computer programming language that belongs to a class of languages envisioned as an advancement upon third-generation programming languages (3GL). Each of the programming language generations aims to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details, making the language more programmer-friendly, powerful, and versatile. While the definition of 4GL has changed over time, it can be typified by operating more with large collections of information at once rather than focusing on just bits and bytes. Languages claimed to be 4GL may include support for database management, report generation, mathematical optimization, graphical user interface (GUI) development, or web development. Some researchers state that 4GLs are a subset of domain-specific languages.\nThe concept of 4GL was developed from the 1970s through the 1990s, overlapping most of the development of 3GL, with 4GLs identified as \"non-procedural\" or \"program-generating\" languages, contrasted with 3GLs being algorithmic or procedural languages. While 3GLs like C, C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript remain popular for a wide variety of uses, 4GLs as originally defined found uses focused on databases, reports, and websites. Some advanced 3GLs like Python, Ruby, and Perl combine some 4GL abilities within a general-purpose 3GL environment, and libraries with 4GL-like features have been developed as add-ons for most popular 3GLs, producing languages that are a mix of 3GL and 4GL, blurring the distinction.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, there were efforts to develop fifth-generation programming languages (5GL).\nHistory.\nThough used earlier in papers and discussions, the term 4GL was first used formally by James Martin in his 1981 book \"Application Development Without Programmers\" to refer to non-procedural, high-level specification languages. In some primitive way, early 4GLs were included in the Informatics MARK-IV (1967) product and Sperry's MAPPER (1969 internal use, 1979 release).\nThe motivations for the '4GL' inception and continued interest are several. The term can apply to a large set of software products. It can also apply to an approach that looks for greater semantic properties and implementation power. Just as the 3GL offered greater power to the programmer, so too did the 4GL open up the development environment to a wider population.\nThe early input scheme for the 4GL supported entry of data within the 72-character limit of the punched card (8 bytes used for sequencing) where a card's tag would identify the type or function. With judicious use of a few cards, the 4GL deck could offer a wide variety of processing and reporting capability whereas the equivalent functionality coded in a 3GL could subsume, perhaps, a whole box or more of cards.\nThe 72-character format continued for a while as hardware progressed to larger memory and terminal interfaces. Even with its limitations, this approach supported highly sophisticated applications.\nAs interfaces improved and allowed longer statement lengths and grammar-driven input handling, greater power ensued. An example of this is described on the Nomad page.\nThe development of the 4GL was influenced by several factors, with the hardware and operating system constraints having a large weight. When the 4GL was first introduced, a disparate mix of hardware and operating systems mandated custom application development support that was specific to the system in order to ensure sales. One example is the MAPPER system developed by Sperry. Though it has roots back to the beginning, the system has proven successful in many applications and has been ported to modern platforms. The latest variant is embedded in the BIS offering of Unisys. MARK-IV is now known as VISION:BUILDER and is offered by Computer Associates.\nThe Santa Fe railroad used MAPPER to develop a system in a project that was an early example of 4GL, rapid prototyping, and programming by users. The idea was that it was easier to teach railroad experts to use MAPPER than to teach programmers the \"intricacies of railroad operations\".\nOne of the early (and portable) languages that had 4GL properties was RAMIS developed by Gerald C. Cohen at Mathematica, a mathematical software company. Cohen left Mathematica and founded Information Builders to create a similar reporting-oriented 4GL, called FOCUS.\nLater 4GL types are tied to a database system and are far different from the earlier types in their use of techniques and resources that have resulted from the general improvement of computing with time.\nAn interesting twist to the 4GL scene is realization that graphical interfaces and the related reasoning done by the user form a 'language' that is poorly understood.\nTypes.\nA number of different types of 4GLs exist:\nSome 4GLs have integrated tools that allow for the easy specification of all the required information:\nLow code environments.\nIn the twenty-first century, 4GL systems have emerged as \"low code\" environments or platforms for the problem of rapid application development in short periods of time. Vendors often provide sample systems such as CRM, contract management, bug tracking from which development can occur with little programming.\nExamples.\nReport generators.\nExtract data from files or database to create reports in a wide range of formats is done by the report generator tools.\nLow code / No code development platforms.\nSource:"}

{"id": "11369", "revid": "299039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11369", "title": "Frank Capra", "text": "Frank Russell Capra (born Francesco Rosario Capra; May 18, 1897\u00a0\u2013 September 3, 1991) was an Italian-American film director, producer, and screenwriter who was the creative force behind several major award-winning films of the 1930s and 1940s. Born in Italy and raised in Los Angeles from the age of five, his rags-to-riches story has led film historians such as Ian Freer to consider him the \"American Dream personified\".\nCapra became one of America's most influential directors during the 1930s, winning three Academy Awards for Best Director from six nominations, along with three other Oscar wins from nine nominations in other categories. Among his leading films were \"It Happened One Night\" (1934), \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936), \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938), and \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939). During World War II, Capra served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and produced propaganda films, such as the \"Why We Fight\" series.\nAfter World War II, Capra's career declined as his later films, such as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), performed poorly when they were first released. Beginning in 1950, his cinematic output slowed, and he retired from filmmaking in the mid-1960s. In the ensuing decades, however, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and other Capra films were revisited favorably by critics. Outside of directing, Capra was active in the film industry, engaging in various political and social activities. He served as President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, worked alongside the Writers Guild of America, and was head of the Directors Guild of America.\nEarly life.\nCapra was born Francesco Rosario Capra in Bisacquino, a village near Palermo, Sicily, Italy. He was the youngest of seven children of Salvatore Capra, a fruit grower, and the former Rosaria \"Sara\" Nicolosi. Capra's family was Roman Catholic. Frank's siblings were Luigia, Ignazia, Benedetto, Antonino Giuseppe, Antonia, and Anne. The name \"Capra\", notes Capra's biographer, Joseph McBride, represents his family's closeness to the land, and means \"goat\". He notes that the English word \"capricious\" derives from it, \"evoking the animal's skittish temperament\", adding that \"the name neatly expresses two aspects of Frank Capra's personality: emotionalism and obstinacy.\"\nIn 1903, when he was five, Capra's family immigrated to the United States, traveling in a steerage compartment of the steamship \"Germania\" \u2014 the cheapest way to make the passage. For Capra, the 13-day journey remained one of the worst experiences of his life:\nCapra remembers the ship's arrival in New York Harbor, where he saw \"a statue of a great lady, taller than a church steeple, holding a torch above the land we were about to enter\". He recalls his father's exclamation at the sight:\nThe family settled in Los Angeles's East Side (today Lincoln Heights) on Avenue 18, which Capra described in his autobiography as an Italian \"ghetto\". Capra's father worked as a fruit picker and young Capra sold newspapers after school for ten years until he graduated from high school. He attended the Manual Arts High School, with Jimmy Doolittle and Lawrence Tibbett as classmates. Instead of working after graduating, as his parents wanted, he enrolled in college. He worked through college at the California Institute of Technology, playing banjo at nightclubs and taking odd jobs like working at the campus laundry, waiting tables, and cleaning engines at a local power plant. He studied chemical engineering and graduated in the spring of 1918. Capra later wrote that his college education had \"changed his whole viewpoint on life from the viewpoint of an alley rat to the viewpoint of a cultured person\".\nWorld War I and later.\nSoon after graduating from college, Capra was commissioned in the United States Army as a second lieutenant, having completed campus ROTC. In the Army, he taught mathematics to artillerymen at Fort Point, San Francisco. His father died during the war in an accident (1916). In the Army, Capra contracted Spanish flu and was medically discharged to return home to live with his mother. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1920, taking the name Frank Russell Capra. Living at home with his siblings and mother, Capra was the only family member with a college education, yet he was the only one who remained chronically unemployed. After a year without work, seeing how his siblings had steady jobs, he felt he was a failure, which led to bouts of depression.\nChronic abdominal pains were later discovered to have been an undiagnosed burst appendix. After recovering at home, Capra moved out and spent the next few years living in flophouses in San Francisco and hopping freight trains, wandering the Western United States. To support himself, he took odd jobs on farms, as a movie extra, playing poker, and selling local oil well stocks.\nDuring this time the 24-year-old Capra directed a 32-minute documentary film titled \"La Visita Dell'Incrociatore Italiano Libya a San Francisco\". Not only did it document the visit of the Italian naval vessel \"Libya\" to San Francisco, but also the reception given to the crew of the ship by San Francisco's L'Italia Virtus Club, now known as the San Francisco Italian Athletic Club.\nAt 25, Capra took a job selling books written and published by American philosopher Elbert Hubbard. Capra recalled that he \"hated being a peasant, being a scrounging new kid trapped in the Sicilian ghetto of Los Angeles. ...\u00a0All I had was cockiness\u2014and let me tell you that gets you a long way.\"\nCareer.\nSilent film comedies.\nDuring his book sales efforts\u2014and nearly broke\u2014Capra read a newspaper article about a new movie studio opening in San Francisco. Capra phoned them saying he had moved from Hollywood and falsely implied that he had experience in the budding film industry. Capra's only prior exposure in films was in 1915 while attending Manual Arts High School. The studio's founder, Walter Montague, was nonetheless impressed by Capra and offered him $75 to direct a one-reel silent film. Capra, with the help of a cameraman, made the film in two days and cast it with amateurs.\nAfter that first serious job in films, Capra began efforts to finding similar openings in the film industry. He took a position with another minor San Francisco studio and subsequently received an offer to work with producer Harry Cohn at his new studio in Los Angeles. During this time, he worked as a property man, film cutter, title writer, and assistant director.\nCapra later became a gag writer for Hal Roach's \"Our Gang\" series. He was twice hired as a writer for a slapstick comedy director, Mack Sennett, in 1918 and 1924. Under him, Capra wrote scripts for comedian Harry Langdon and produced by Mack Sennett, the first being \"Plain Clothes\" in 1925. According to Capra, it was he who invented Langdon's character, the innocent fool living in a \"naughty world\"; however, Langdon was well into this character by 1925.\nWhen Langdon eventually left Sennett to make longer, feature-length movies with First National Studios, he took Capra along as his personal writer and director. They made three feature films together during 1926 and 1927, all of them successful with critics and the public. The films made Langdon a recognized comedian in the caliber of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Following the production of \"Long Pants\" (1927), Capra argued with Langdon over the direction his next project would take. Langdon's other confidant was writer-director Arthur Ripley, a fellow Sennett alumnus, and Langdon followed Ripley's suggestions. Capra quit, and the split was disastrous for Langdon, who took matters into his own hands and directed his films himself, to poor reception.\nAfter Capra split with Langdon, he directed a picture for First National, \"For the Love of Mike\" (1927). This was a silent comedy about three bickering godfathers\u2014a German, a Jew, and an Irishman\u2014starring a budding actress, Claudette Colbert. The movie was considered a failure and is a lost film.\nColumbia Pictures.\nCapra returned to Harry Cohn's studio, now named Columbia Pictures, which was then producing short films and two-reel comedies for \"fillers\" to play between main features. Columbia was one of many start-up studios on \"Poverty Row\" in Los Angeles. Like the others, Columbia was unable to compete with larger studios, which often had their own production facilities, distribution, and theaters. Cohn rehired Capra in 1928 to help his studio produce new, full-length feature films, to compete with the major studios. Capra would eventually direct 20 films for Cohn's studio, including many of his classics.\nBecause of Capra's engineering education, he adapted more easily to the new sound technology than most directors. He welcomed the transition to sound, recalling, \"I wasn't at home in silent films.\" Most studios were unwilling to invest in the new sound technology, assuming it was a passing fad. Many in Hollywood considered sound a threat to the industry and hoped it would pass quickly; McBride notes that \"Capra was not one of them.\" When he saw Al Jolson singing in \"The Jazz Singer\" in 1927, considered the first talkie, Capra recalled his reaction:\nFew of the studio heads or crew were aware of Capra's engineering background until he began directing \"The Younger Generation\" in 1929. The chief cinematographer who worked with Capra on a number of films was likewise unaware. He describes this early period in sound for film:\nDuring his first year with Columbia, Capra directed nine films, some of which were successful. After the first few, Harry Cohn said: \"it was the beginning of Columbia making a better quality of pictures.\" According to Barson, \"Capra became ensconced as Harry Cohn's most trusted director.\" His films soon established Capra as a \"bankable\" director known throughout the industry, and Cohn raised Capra's initial salary of $1,000 per film to $25,000 per year. Capra directed a film for MGM during this period, but soon realized he \"had much more freedom under Harry Cohn's benevolent dictatorship\", where Cohn also put Capra's \"name above the title\" of his films, a first for the movie industry. Capra wrote of this period and recalled the confidence that Cohn placed in Capra's vision and directing:\nCapra directed his first \"real\" sound picture, \"The Younger Generation\", in 1929. It was a rags-to-riches romantic comedy about a Jewish family's upward mobility in New York City, with their son later trying to deny his Jewish roots to keep his rich, gentile girlfriend. According to Capra biographer Joseph McBride, Capra \"obviously felt a strong identification with the story of a Jewish immigrant who grows up in the ghetto of New York\u00a0... and feels he has to deny his ethnic origins to rise to success in America.\" Capra, however, denied any connection of the story with his own life.\nNonetheless, McBride insists that \"The Younger Generation\" abounds with parallels to Capra's own life. McBride notes the \"devastatingly painful climactic scene\", where the young social-climbing son, embarrassed when his wealthy new friends first meet his parents, passes his mother and father off as house servants. That scene, notes McBride, \"echoes the shame Capra admitted feeling toward his own family as he rose in social status\".\nDuring his years at Columbia, Capra worked often with screenwriter Robert Riskin (husband of Fay Wray), and cameraman Joseph Walker. In many of Capra's films, the wise-cracking and sharp dialogue was often written by Riskin, and he and Capra went on to become Hollywood's \"most admired writer-director team\".\nFilm career (1934\u20131941).\n\"It Happened One Night\" (1934).\nCapra's films in the 1930s enjoyed immense success at the Academy Awards. \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) became the first film to win all five top Oscars (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay). Written by Robert Riskin, it is one of the first screwball comedies, and with its release in the Great Depression, critics considered it an escapist story and a celebration of the American Dream. The film established the names of Capra, Columbia Pictures, and stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the movie industry. The film has been called \"picaresque\". It was one of the earliest road movies and inspired variations on that theme by other filmmakers.\nHe followed the film with \"Broadway Bill\" (1934), a screwball comedy about horse racing. The film was a turning point for Capra, however, as he began to conceive an additional dimension to his movies. He started using his films to convey messages to the public. Capra explains his new thinking:\nThis added goal was inspired after meeting with a Christian Scientist friend who told him to view his talents in a different way:\nCapra began to embody messages in subsequent films, many of which conveyed \"fantasies of goodwill\". The first of those was \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936), for which Capra won his second Best Director Oscar. Critic Alistair Cooke observed that Capra was \"starting to make movies about themes instead of people\".\nIn 1938, Capra won his third Director Oscar in five years for \"You Can't Take It with You\", which also won Best Picture. In addition to his three directing wins, Capra received directing nominations for three other films (\"Lady for a Day\", \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", and \"It's a Wonderful Life\"). On May 5, 1936, Capra hosted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony.\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939).\nAlthough \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is his best-known film, Friedman notes that it was \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), which most represented the \"Capra myth\". That film expressed Capra's patriotism more than any others, and \"presented the individual working within the democratic system to overcome rampant political corruption\".\nThe film, however, became Capra's most controversial. In his research before filming, he was able to stand close to President Franklin D. Roosevelt during a press conference after the recent acts of war by Germany in Europe. Capra recalls his fears:\nWhen the filming was completed, the studio sent preview copies to Washington. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., U.S. ambassador to the UK, wrote to Columbia head Harry Cohn, \"Please do not play this picture in Europe.\" Politicians were concerned about the potential negative effect the film might have on the morale of the United States' allies, as World War II had begun. Kennedy wrote to President Roosevelt that, \"In foreign countries this film must inevitably strengthen the mistaken impression that the United States is full of graft, corruption and lawlessness.\" Many studio heads agreed, nor did they want negative feelings about Hollywood instilled in political leaders.\nNonetheless, Capra's vision of the film's significance was clear:\nCapra pleaded with Cohn to allow the film to go into distribution and remembers the intensity of their decision making:\nCohn and Capra chose to ignore the negative publicity and demands and released the film as planned. It was later nominated for 11 Academy Awards, only winning one (for Best Original Story) partly because the number of major pictures that were nominated that year was 10, including \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone with the Wind\". Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons called it a \"smash patriotic hit\" and most critics agreed, seeing that audiences left the theaters with \"an enthusiasm for democracy\" and \"in a glow of patriotism.\"\nThe significance of the film's message was established further in France, shortly after World War II began. When the French public was asked to select which film they wanted to see most, having been told by the Vichy government that soon no more American films would be allowed in France, the overwhelming majority chose it over all others. To a France soon to be invaded and occupied by Nazi forces, the film most expressed the \"perseverance of democracy and the American way.\"\nImpasse.\nCapra became enchanted with a German-made film biography of composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. He purchased the film himself as a basis for his new production, and recruited one of Columbia's leading writers, Sidney Buchman, to fashion a screenplay. Capra spent a full year working on the Chopin project, and the film was ready to go into production. Capra wanted to make the film in the costly Technicolor process\u2014a first for Columbia\u2014but Columbia's New York office balked at the expense. As Cohn's biographer Bob Thomas recounted, \"They were aghast at the prospect of trying to sell an expensive costume film about a piano player and a woman novelist who wore pants and smoked cigars. The opposition was strong enough to veto the project.\" The enraged Capra quit Columbia. Harry Cohn tried to lure him back with an unprecedented profit-sharing split of 50/50, but Capra accepted a million-dollar cash offer from Warner Bros. Columbia ultimately went ahead with the Chopin biography, in Technicolor, under the direction of Charles Vidor: \"A Song to Remember\" (1945).\n\"Meet John Doe\" (1941).\nCapra's first Warner project was \"Meet John Doe\" (1941). So important was the Capra name that Warner Bros. took its own name off the main title. Instead of the usual \"Warner Bros. Pictures presents\", \"Meet John Doe\" begins with \"Presenting\".\nSome consider \"Meet John Doe\" to be Capra's most controversial movie. The film's hero, played by Gary Cooper, is a former baseball player now bumming around, lacking goals. He is selected by a news reporter to represent the \"common man,\" to capture the imagination of ordinary Americans. The film was released shortly before America became involved in World War II, and citizens were still in an isolationist mood. According to some historians, the film was made to convey a \"deliberate reaffirmation of American values,\" though ones that seemed uncertain with respect to the future.\nFilm author Richard Glazer speculates that the film may have been autobiographical, \"reflecting Capra's own uncertainties\". Glazer describes how, \"John's accidental transformation from drifter to national figure parallels Capra's own early drifting experience and subsequent involvement in movie making\u00a0... \"Meet John Doe\", then, was an attempt to work out his own fears and questions.\"\nWorld War II years (1941\u20131945).\nJoining the Army after Pearl Harbor.\nWithin four days of the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Capra quit his successful directing career in Hollywood and received a commission as a major in the United States Army. He also gave up his presidency of the Screen Directors Guild. Being 44 years of age, he was not asked to enlist, but, notes Friedman, \"Capra had an intense desire to prove his patriotism to his adopted land.\"\nCapra recalls some personal reasons for enlisting:\n\"Why We Fight\" series.\nDuring the next four years of World War II, Capra's job was to head a special section on morale to explain to soldiers \"why the hell they're in uniform\", writes Capra, and were not \"propaganda\" films like those created by the Nazis and Japan. Capra directed or co-directed seven documentary war information films.\nCapra was assigned to work directly under Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, the most senior officer in command of the Army, who later created the Marshall Plan and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. Marshall chose to bypass the usual documentary film-making department, Signal Corps, because he felt they were not capable of producing \"sensitive and objective troop information films\". One colonel explained the importance of these future films to Capra:\nDuring his first meeting with General Marshall, Capra was told his mission:\nCapra ended up directing a seven-episode \"Why We Fight\" series: \"Prelude to War\" (1942), \"The Nazis Strike\" (1942), \"Divide and Conquer\" (1943), \"The Battle of Britain\" (1943), \"The Battle of Russia\" (1943), \"The Battle of China\" (1944), and \"War Comes to America\" (1945). Additionally, Capra directed or co-directed the propaganda films \"Tunisian Victory\" (1945) \"\" (1945), \"Here Is Germany\" (1945), and \"Two Down and One to Go\" (1945), which do not bear the \"Why We Fight\" banner. Capra also produced the critically acclaimed \"The Negro Soldier\" (1944), which was directed by Stuart Heisler. Capra also directed, uncredited, the 13-minute film \"Your Job in Germany\" (1945), which was meant for US troops headed to Allied-occupied Germany.\nAfter he completed the first few documentaries, government officials and U.S. Army staff felt they were powerful messages and excellent presentations of why it was necessary for the United States to fight in the war. All footage came from military and government sources, whereas during earlier years, many newsreels secretly used footage from enemy sources. Animated charts were created by Walt Disney and his animators. A number of Hollywood composers wrote the background music, including Alfred Newman and Russian-born composer Dimitri Tiomkin. After the first complete film was viewed by General Marshall along with U.S. Army staff\u2014and Franklin Roosevelt\u2014Marshall approached Capra: \"Colonel Capra, how did you do it? That is a most wonderful thing.\"\nFDR was effusive: \"I want every American to see this motion picture. General\u2014please make all necessary arrangements\". \"Prelude To War\" was distributed by 20th Century-Fox, and was nationally acclaimed. Fox also released Capra's \"Why We Fight\" opus, \"The Battle Of Russia\". Released to service audiences in two-parts to accommodate hour-long periods during induction training, the nine-reel (nearly 90 minutes) epic detailed Russian history using excerpts of the films of Sergei Eisenstein, then proceeded to recent history through captured Nazi newsreels and those supplied reluctantly by Stalin. When he was shown the film in Moscow, Stalin was effusive and ordered one thousand 35mm prints. He was so anxious that his people should see the film that he did not bother creating a Russian soundtrack. Capra laughed in amazement years later when re-counting the tale: \"Stalin had interpreters at the side of the stage in all the theatres. They simply translated the film on the fly, yelling like hell to be heard over the music and sound effects\". The series was seen in theaters throughout the U.S. They were also translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese for screening in other countries, under the aegis of Robert Riskin. Winston Churchill ordered that all of them be shown to the British public in theaters.\nFollowing a shifting of alliances at the end of World War II, some of the \"Why We Fight\" films were effectively banned. \"The Battle Of Russia\", due to its positivity toward the Soviet Union, was essentially banned until the 1980s. Conversely, some of the other films, which spoke negatively of the Germans and Japanese, were taken out of print, as these countries were now allies. \"Know Your Enemy: Japan\", which barely saw a release because its release date came just days before the Japanese surrender, was kept under wraps afterwards as well: Capra noted that the U.S. \"suddenly needed friendly relations with the Japs and the film, along with several others, was locked up\".\nThe \"Why We Fight\" series is widely considered a masterpiece of war information documentaries. \"Prelude to War\", the first in the series, won the 1942 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. When his career ended, Capra regarded these films as his most important works. He was discharged from the service in 1945 as a colonel, having been awarded the Legion of Merit in 1943, the Distinguished Service Medal in 1945, the World War I Victory Medal (for his service in World War I), the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.\nPost-war career (1946\u20131961).\n\"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946).\nAfter the war ended, along with directors William Wyler and George Stevens, Capra founded Liberty Films. Their studio became the first independent company of directors since United Artists in 1919 whose goal was to make films without interference by studio bosses. However, the only pictures completed by the studio were \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946) and \"State of the Union\" (1948). The first of these was a box office disappointment but was nominated for five Academy Awards.\nThe copyright status of \"It's a Wonderful Life\" remains in flux. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) named it one of the best films ever made, putting it at 11th on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list of the top American films of all time. In 2006, the AFI put the film at the top of its AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers list, ranking what AFI considers the most inspirational American movies of all time. It would become Capra's last film to win major acclaim\u2014his successful years were now behind him, although he directed five more films over the next 14 years.\nFor \"State of the Union\" (1948), Capra changed studios. It would be the only time he ever worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Although the project had an excellent pedigree with stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, the film was not a success, and Capra's statement, \"I think \"State of the Union\" was my most perfect film in handling people and ideas\" has few adherents today.\nRepresenting U.S. at International Film Festival.\nIn January 1952, the U.S. Ambassador to India asked Capra to represent the U.S. film industry at an International Film Festival to be held in India. A State Department friend of Capra asked him and explained why his trip would be important:\nAfter two weeks in India, Capra discovered that Bowles' fears were warranted, as many film sessions were used by Russian and Chinese representatives to give long political speeches. At a lunch with 15 Indian directors and producers, he stressed that \"they must preserve freedom as artists, and that any government control would hinder that freedom. A totalitarian system\u2014and they would become nothing but publicity men for the party in power.\" Capra had a difficult time communicating this, however, as he noted in his diary:\nWhen he returned to Washington to give his report, Secretary of State Dean Acheson gave Capra his commendation for \"virtually single-handedly forestalling a possible Communist take-over of Indian films\". Ambassador Bowles also conveyed gratitude to Capra for \"one helluva job\".\nDisillusionment period and later years.\nFollowing \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"State of the Union,\" which were done soon after the war ended, Capra's themes were becoming out of step with changes in the film industry and the public mood. Friedman finds that while Capra's ideas were popular with depression-era and prewar audiences, they became less relevant to a prospering postwar America. Capra didn't help his own cause when he consulted old 1930s scripts for his latest productions. Capra had become \"disconnected from an American culture that had changed\" during the previous decade. Biographer Joseph McBride argues that Capra's disillusionment was more related to the negative effect that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) had on the film industry in general. The HUAC interrogations in the early 1950s ended many Hollywood careers. Capra himself was not called to testify, although he was a prime target of the committee due to his past associations with many Hollywood blacklisted screenwriters.\nCapra blamed his early retirement from films on the rising power of stars, which forced him to continually compromise his artistic vision. He also claimed that increasing budgetary and scheduling demands had constrained his creative abilities. Film historian Michael Medved agreed with Capra, noting that he walked away from the movie business because \"he refused to adjust to the cynicism of the new order.\" In his autobiography, written in 1971, Capra expressed his feelings about the shifting film industry:\nCapra added that in his opinion, \"practically all the Hollywood film-making of today is stooping to cheap salacious pornography in a crazy bastardization of a great art to compete for the 'patronage' of deviates and masturbators.\"\nCapra remained employable in Hollywood during and after the HUAC hearings but chose nonetheless to demonstrate his loyalty by attempting to re-enlist in the Army at the outbreak of the Korean War, in 1950. He was rejected due to his age. He was later invited to join the Defense Department's newly formed Think Tank project, VISTA, but was denied the necessary clearance. According to Friedman, \"these two rejections were devastating to the man who had made a career of demonstrating American ideals in film\", along with his directing award-winning documentary films for the Army.\nLater films (1950\u20131961).\nCapra directed two films at Paramount Pictures starring Bing Crosby, \"Riding High\" (1950, a remake of 1934's \"Broadway Bill\") and \"Here Comes the Groom\" (1951). By 1952, at the age of 55, Capra effectively retired from Hollywood filmmaking; he shifted to working with the California Institute of Technology, his alma mater, to produce educational films on science topics.\nFrom 1952 to 1956, Capra produced four science-related television specials in color for The Bell System Science Series: \"Our Mr. Sun\" (1956), \"Hemo the Magnificent\" (1957), \"The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays\" (1957), and \"Meteora: The Unchained Goddess\" (1958). These educational science documentaries were popular favorites for school science classrooms for around 30 years. It was eight years before he directed another theatrical film, \"A Hole in the Head\" (1959) with Frank Sinatra and Edward G. Robinson, his first feature film in color. His final theatrical film was with Glenn Ford and Bette Davis, named \"Pocketful of Miracles\" (1961), a remake of his 1933 film \"Lady for a Day\". In the mid-1960s he worked on pre-production for an adaptation of Martin Caidin's novel \"Marooned,\" but he felt he could not make the movie on the $3 million budget he was given, and abandoned the project. (A film adaptation was finally made in 1969, directed by John Sturges with an $8 million budget.)\nCapra's final film, \"Rendezvous in Space\" (1964), was an industrial film made for the Martin Marietta Company and shown at the 1964 New York World's Fair. It was exhibited at the New York Hall of Science after the Fair ended.\nDirecting style.\nCapra's directing style relied on improvisation to a great extent. He was noted for going on the set with no more than the master scenes written. He explained his reasoning:\nAccording to some experts, Capra used great, unobtrusive craftsmanship when directing, and felt it was bad directing to distract the audience with fancy technical gimmicks. Film historian and author William S. Pechter described Capra's style as one \"of almost classical purity\". He adds that his style relied on editing to help his films sustain a \"sequence of rhythmic motion\". Pechter describes its effect:\nFilm critic John Raeburn discusses an early Capra film, \"American Madness\" (1932), as an example of how he had mastered the movie medium and expressed a unique style:\nAs for Capra's subject matter, film author Richard Griffith tries to summarize Capra's common theme:\nCapra's personality when directing gave him a reputation for \"fierce independence\" when dealing with studio bosses. On the set he was said to be gentle and considerate, \"a director who displays absolutely no exhibitionism.\" As Capra's films often carry a message about basic goodness in human nature, and show the value of unselfishness and hard work, his wholesome, feel-good themes have led some cynics to term his style \"Capra-corn\". However, those who hold his vision in higher regard prefer the term \"Capraesque\".\nCapra's basic themes of championing the common man, as well as his use of spontaneous, fast-paced dialogue and goofy, memorable lead and supporting characters, made him one of the most popular and respected filmmakers of the 20th century. His influence can be traced in the works of many directors, including Robert Altman, Ron Howard, Masaki Kobayashi, Akira Kurosawa, John Lasseter, David Lynch, John Milius, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.\nPersonal life.\nCapra married actress Helen Howell in 1923. They divorced in 1928. He married Lucille Warner in 1932, with whom he had a daughter and three sons, one of whom, Johnny, died at age 3 following a tonsillectomy.\nCapra was four times president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and three times president of the Directors Guild of America, which he helped found. Under his presidency, he worked to give directors more artistic control of their films. During his career as a director, he retained an early ambition to teach science, and after his career declined in the 1950s, he made educational television films related to science subjects.\nPhysically, Capra was short, stocky, and vigorous, and enjoyed outdoor activities, such as hunting, fishing, and mountain climbing. In his later years, he spent time writing short stories and songs, along with playing guitar. He collected fine and rare books during the 1930s and 1940s. Six hundred forty items from his \"distinguished library\" were sold by Parke-Bernet Galleries at auction in New York in April 1949, realizing $68,000 ($ today).\nHis son, Frank Capra Jr., was the president of EUE Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina, until his death on December 19, 2007. His grandsons, brothers Frank Capra III and Jonathan Capra, have both worked as assistant directors; Frank III worked on the 1995 film \"The American President\", which referred to Frank Capra in the film's dialogue.\nPolitical views.\nCapra's political views coalesced in some of his movies, which promoted and celebrated the spirit of American individualism. A conservative Republican, Capra railed against Franklin D. Roosevelt during his tenure as governor of New York and opposed his presidency during the years of the Depression. Capra stood against government intervention during the national economic crisis. Nevertheless, the Los Angeles FBI chapter in May 1947 regarded Capra's film \"It's a Wonderful Life\" as glorifying \u201cvalues or institutions judged to be particularly anti-American or pro-Communist.\u201d\nIn his later years, Capra became a self-described pacifist and was very critical of the Vietnam War.\nReligious views.\nCapra wrote in his early adulthood that he was a \"Christmas Catholic\". In his later years, Capra returned to the Catholic Church and described himself as \"a Catholic in spirit; one who firmly believes that the anti-moral, the intellectual bigots, and the Mafias of ill will may destroy religion, but they will never conquer the cross\".\nDeath.\nIn 1985, aged 88, Capra suffered the first of a series of strokes. On September 3, 1991, he died of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in La Quinta, California, at the age of 94. He was interred at Coachella Valley Public Cemetery in Coachella, California.\nHe left part of his 1,100 acre ranch in Fallbrook, California, to the California Institute of Technology, to be used as a retreat center. Capra's personal papers and some film-related materials are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives, which allows scholars and media experts full access.\nLegacy.\nDuring the golden age of Hollywood, Capra's \"fantasies of goodwill\" made him one of the two or three most famous and successful directors in the world. Film historian Ian Freer notes that at the time of his death in 1991, his legacy remained intact:\nDirector/actor John Cassavetes contemplating Capra's contribution to film quipped: \"Maybe there really wasn't an America, it was only Frank Capra.\" Capra's films were his love letters to an idealized America\u2014a cinematic landscape of his own invention. The performances his actors gave were invariable portrayals of personalities developed into recognizable images of popular culture, \"their acting has the bold simplicity of an icon\u00a0...\"\nLike his contemporary, director John Ford, Capra defined and aggrandized the tropes of mythic America where individual courage invariably triumphs over collective evil. Film historian Richard Griffith speaks of Capra's \"...\u00a0reliance on sentimental conversation and the ultimate benevolence of ordinary America to resolve all deep conflicts.\" \"Average America\" is visualized as \"...\u00a0a tree-lined street, undistinguished frame houses surrounded by modest areas of grass, a few automobiles. For certain purposes, it assumed that all \"real \"Americans live in towns like this, and so great is the power of myth, even the born city-dweller is likely to believe vaguely that he too lives on this shady street, or comes from it, or is going to.\"\nNYU professor Leonard Quart writes:\nAlthough Capra's stature as a director had declined in the 1950s, his films underwent a revival in the 1960s:\nFrench film historian John Raeburn, editor of \"Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma\", noted that Capra's films were unknown in France, but there too his films underwent a fresh discovery by the public. He believes the reason for his renewed popularity had to do with his themes, which he made credible \"an ideal conception of an American national character\":\nIn 1982, the American Film Institute honored Capra by giving him their AFI Life Achievement Award. The event was used to create the television film, \"The American Film Institute Salute to Frank Capra\", hosted by James Stewart. In 1986, Capra received the National Medal of Arts. During his acceptance speech for the AFI award, Capra stressed his most important values:\nCapra expanded on his visions in his 1971 autobiography, \"The Name Above the Title\":\nAwards and honors.\nThe \"Why We Fight\" series earned Capra the Legion of Merit in 1943 and the Distinguished Service Medal in 1945.\nIn 1957, Capra was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.\nLos Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, by a vote of the city council, declared May 12, 1962 as \"Frank Capra Day\". George Sidney, President of the Directors Guild stated that \"This is the first time in the history of Hollywood, that the city of Los Angeles has officially recognized a creative talent.\" At the event ceremony, director John Ford announced that Capra had also received an honorary Order of the British Empire (OBE) on the recommendation of Winston Churchill. Ford suggested publicly to Capra:\nIn 1966, Capra was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award from his alma mater Caltech. (see section \"Early Life\", supra)\nIn 1972, Capra received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.\nIn 1974, Capra was awarded the Inkpot Award.\nIn 1975, Capra was awarded the Golden Anchor Award by the U.S. Naval Reserve's Combat Camera Group for his contribution to World War II Naval photography and production of the \"Why We Fight\" series. The award ceremony included a video salute by President Ford. Attending were many of Capra's favorite actors including Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Pat O'Brien, Jean Arthur, and others.\nAn annual \"It's a Wonderful Life\" celebration that Capra attended in 1981, during which he said, \"This is one of the proudest moments of my life,\" was recounted in \"The New Yorker\".\nHe was nominated six times for Best Director and seven times for Outstanding Production/Best Picture. Out of six nominations for Best Director, Capra received the award three times. He briefly held the record for winning the most Best Director Oscars when he won for the third time in 1938, until this record was matched by John Ford in 1941, and then later surpassed by Ford in 1952. William Wyler also matched this record upon winning his third Oscar in 1959.\nThe Academy Film Archive has preserved two of Capra's films, \"The Matinee Idol\" (1928) and \"Two Down and One to Go\" (1945)."}

The tournament has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 due to the Second World War. The reigning champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 World Cup by defeating France.\nThe contest starts with the qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over the course of about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify for the group stage of the tournament. The competition is scheduled to expand to 48 teams, starting with the 2026 World Cup.\nAs of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 22 final tournaments have been held since the event's inception in 1930, and a total of 80 national teams have competed. The trophy has been won by eight national teams. With five wins, Brazil is the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, with three titles; France and inaugural winner Uruguay, each with two titles; and England and Spain, with one title each.\nThe World Cup is globally regarded as the most prestigious association football competition, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The viewership of the 2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57\u00a0billion, close to half of the global population, while the engagement with the 2022 World Cup was estimated to be 5\u00a0billion, with about 1.5\u00a0billion people watching the final match.\nSeventeen countries have hosted the World Cup, most recently Qatar, who hosted the 2022 event. The 2026 tournament will be jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.\nHistory.\nPrevious international competitions.\nThe world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England. The first international tournament for nations, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884 and included games between England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics; however, the International Olympic Committee has retroactively upgraded their status to official events, as well as the 1906 Intercalated Games.\nAfter FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been unsuccessful.\nAt the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official Olympic sport. Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold medals. They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.\nWith the Olympic event continuing to be a contest between amateur teams only, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as \"The First World Cup\", and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title. Prior to the Lipton competition, from 1876 to 1904, games that were considered to be the \"football world championship\" were meetings between leading English and Scottish clubs, such as the 1895 game between Sunderland A.F.C. and the Heart of Midlothian F.C., which Sunderland won.\nIn 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a \"world football championship for amateurs\", and took responsibility for managing the event. This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition for nations, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium. Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era, and is the reason why Uruguay is allowed to wear 4 stars.\nWorld Cups before World War II.\nDue to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.\nThe national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides, especially in the midst of the Great Depression. As such, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America.\nThe first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4\u20131 and Belgium 3\u20130 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France. In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4\u20132 in front of 93,000 spectators in Montevideo, and became the first nation to win the World Cup. After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players; football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics. After the IOC and FIFA worked out their differences, Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.\nThe issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 World Cup and all North and South American nations except Brazil and Cuba boycotted the 1938 tournament. Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which Germany and Brazil sought to host, were cancelled due to World War II.\nWorld Cups after World War II.\nThe 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to include British football associations. Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland had withdrawn from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football. The teams rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation. The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called \"Maracanazo\" (Portuguese: \"Maracana\u00e7o\").\nIn the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams. Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: United States, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.\nExpansion to 24 and 32 teams.\nThe tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 1982, and then to 32 in 1998, allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014; and Morocco, finishing in fourth place in 2022. European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.\nTwo hundred teams entered the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification rounds. 198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. A record 204 countries entered qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nExpansion to 48 teams.\nIn October 2013, Sepp Blatter spoke of guaranteeing the Caribbean Football Union's region a position in the World Cup. In the edition of 25 October 2013 of the \"FIFA Weekly\" Blatter wrote that: \"From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup. It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup.\" Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.\nFollowing the magazine's publication, Blatter's would-be opponent for the FIFA Presidency, UEFA President Michel Platini, responded that he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to UEFA, two each to the Asian Football Confederation and the Confederation of African Football, two shared between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and a guaranteed place for the Oceania Football Confederation. Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: \"[The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup\u00a0... but it's a good compromise.\u00a0... It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve.\"\nIn October 2016, FIFA president Gianni Infantino stated his support for a 48-team World Cup in 2026. On 10 January 2017, FIFA confirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist teams.\n2015 FIFA corruption case.\nBy May 2015, the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games, with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150\u00a0million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on 29 May and 3 December. By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.\nOn 4 June 2015, Chuck Blazer while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of FIFA's then-executive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 World Cups. On 10 June 2015, Swiss authorities seized computer data from the offices of Sepp Blatter. The same day, FIFA postponed the bidding process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in light of the allegations surrounding bribery in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Then-secretary general J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke stated, \"Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being.\" On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential candidate for presidency, were suspended for 90 days; both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media.\nOn 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May. An additional 16 indictments by the US Department of Justice were announced on the same day.\nBiennial World Cup proposition.\nA biennial World Cup plan was first proposed by the Saudi Arabian Football Federation at the 71st FIFA Congress on 21 May 2021 and prominently backed by former Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and national federations in Africa and Asia.\nContinental confederations such as UEFA and CONMEBOL are not on board with the plan but, in total, the idea is supported by 166 of the 210 member associations of FIFA.\nOther FIFA tournaments.\nAn equivalent tournament for women's football, the FIFA Women's World Cup, was first held in 1991 in China. The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.\nMen's football has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's football tournament at the Olympics is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players. Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996.\nThe FIFA Confederations Cup was a tournament held one year before the World Cup at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country. The first edition took place in 1992 and the last edition was played in 2017. In March 2019, FIFA confirmed that the tournament would no longer be active owing to an expansion of the FIFA Club World Cup in 2021.\nFIFA also organises international tournaments for youth football (FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup), club football (FIFA Club World Cup), and football variants such as futsal (FIFA Futsal World Cup) and beach soccer (FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup). The latter three do not have a women's version, although a FIFA Women's Club World Cup has been proposed.\nThe FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup is held biannually, including the year before each Women's World Cup. Both tournaments were awarded in a single bidding process on three occasions, with the U-20 tournament serving as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition each time (2010, 2014 and 2018).\nTrophy.\nFrom 1930 to 1970, the \"Jules Rimet Trophy\" was awarded to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply known as the \"World Cup\" or \"Coupe du Monde\", but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.\nAfter 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is high, made of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs .\nThe base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: \"The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.\"\nThis new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.\nAll members (players, coaches, and managers) of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the World Cup Trophy; winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the 2002 edition, fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts South Korea. Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.\nSince 2006, winners of the competition are also awarded the right to wear the FIFA Champions Badge, up until the time at which the winner of the next competition is decided.\nFormat.\nQualification.\nSince the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament. They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, and Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.\nThe qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup. From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.\nFinal tournament.\nThe final tournament format since 1998 has had 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nations. There are two stages: the group stage, followed by the knockout stage.\nIn the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different \"pots\", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.\nEach group plays a round-robin tournament in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).\nConsidering six matches in a group each with three possible outcomes (win, draw, loss), there are 729 (= 36) possible final table outcomes for the 40 possible combinations of the four teams' points. However, 14 of the 40 points combinations (or 207 of the 729 possible outcomes) lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined by:\nThe knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.\nOn 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup (to accommodate more teams), which was to consist of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026. On 14 March 2023, FIFA approved a revised format of the 2026 tournament, which features 12 groups of four teams each, with the top 8 third-placed teams joining the group winners and runners-up in a new round of 32.\nIn March 2025, it was reported that FIFA was considering an one-off expansion to 64 teams for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the centennial anniversary of the FIFA World Cup.\nHosts.\nSelection process.\nEarly World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the first tournament with multiple hosts. South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in 2010. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since Argentina 1978, and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe.\nThe host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under an exhaustive ballot system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a \"Hosting Agreement\" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. There have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament.\nFor the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament was rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation did not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup was chosen to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, marking the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations. The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held, with 48 teams playing 104 matches. Sixty matches will take place in the US, including all matches from the quarter-finals onward, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 games each.\nPerformances.\nSix of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exceptions being Brazil, who finished as runners-up after losing the deciding match on home soil in 1950 and lost their semi-final against Germany in 2014, and Spain, which reached the second round on home soil in 1982. England (1966) won its only title while playing as a host nation. Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), Argentina (1978), and France (1998) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while Germany (1974) won their second title on home soil.\nOther nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. Switzerland (quarter-finals 1954), Sweden (runners-up in 1958), Chile (third place in 1962), South Korea (fourth place in 2002), Russia (quarter-finals 2018), and Mexico (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best results when serving as hosts. So far, South Africa (2010) and Qatar (2022) failed to advance beyond the first round.\nBroadcasting and promotion.\nThe World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29\u00a0billion. 715.1\u00a0million individuals watched the final match of the tournament, almost a ninth of the entire population of the planet. The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300\u00a0million viewers. The World Cup attracts major sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event.\nThe governing body of the sport, FIFA, generated $4.8\u00a0billion in revenue from the 2014 tournament, and $6.1\u00a0billion from the 2018 tournament.\nEach FIFA World Cup since 1966 has its own mascot or logo. \"World Cup Willie\", the mascot for the 1966 competition, was the first World Cup mascot. World Cups feature official match balls specially designed for each tournament. After Slazenger produced the ball for the 1966 World Cup Adidas became the official supplier to FIFA. Each World Cup also has an official song, which have been performed by artists ranging from Shakira to Will Smith. Other songs, such as \"Nessun dorma\", performed by The Three Tenors at four World Cup concerts, have also become identified with the tournament.\nForming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, Panini published its first sticker album for the 1970 World Cup. Since then, collecting and trading stickers and cards has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation. FIFA has licensed World Cup video games since 1986, sponsored by Electronic Arts.\nResults.\nIn all, 80 nations have played in at least one World Cup. Of these, eight national teams have won the World Cup, and they have added stars to their badges, with each star representing a World Cup victory. Uruguay, however, chose to display four stars on their badge, representing their two gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, which are recognized by FIFA as World Championships, and their two World Cup titles in 1930 and 1950.\nWith five titles, Brazil are the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have played in every World Cup (22) to date. Brazil were also the first team to win the World Cup for the third (1970), fourth (1994) and fifth (2002) time. Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. West Germany (1982\u20131990) and Brazil (1994\u20132002) are the only nations to appear in three consecutive World Cup finals. Germany has made the most top-four finishes (13), medals (12), as well as the most finals (8).\nBest performances by confederations.\nTo date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by teams from the UEFA (Europe) and CONMEBOL (South America) confederations. European nations have won twelve titles, while South American nations have won ten. Only three teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: United States (North, Central America and Caribbean) in 1930; South Korea (Asia) in 2002; and Morocco (Africa) in 2022. Only one Oceanian qualifier, Australia in 2006, has advanced to the second round, a feat they later reaccomplished in 2022.\nBrazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the only teams to win a World Cup hosted outside their continental confederation; Brazil came out victorious in Europe (1958), North America (1970 and 1994) and Asia (2002). Argentina won a World Cup in North America in 1986 and in Asia in 2022. Spain won in Africa in 2010. In 2014, Germany became the first European team to win in the Americas. Only on five occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent; the longest streak of tournaments won by a single confederation is four, with the 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018 tournaments all won by UEFA teams (Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, respectively).\nRecords and statistics.\nSix players share the record for playing in the most World Cups; Mexico's Antonio Carbajal (1950\u20131966). Rafael M\u00e1rquez (2002\u20132018), and Andr\u00e9s Guardado (2006\u20132022); Germany's Lothar Matth\u00e4us (1982\u20131998); Argentina's Lionel Messi (2006\u20132022); and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo (2006\u20132022) all played in five tournaments, with Ronaldo also being the first and only player to score in five tournaments. Messi has played the most World Cup matches overall, with 26 appearances. Brazil's Djalma Santos (1954\u20131962), West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer (1966\u20131974), and Germany's Philipp Lahm (2006\u20132014) are the only players to be named to three World Cup All-Star Teams.\nMiroslav Klose of Germany (2002\u20132014) is the all-time top scorer at the World Cup with 16 goals. He broke Ronaldo of Brazil's record of 15 goals (1998\u20132006) during the 2014 semi-final match against Brazil. West Germany's Gerd M\u00fcller (1970\u20131974) is third, with 14 goals. The fourth-placed goalscorer, France's Just Fontaine, holds the record for the most goals scored in a single World Cup; all his 13 goals were scored in the 1958 tournament.\nIn November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals. This made Brazil's Pel\u00e9 the only player to have won three World Cup winners' medals (1958, 1962, and 1970, although he did not play in the 1962 final due to injury), with 20 other players who have won two winners' medals. Seven players have collected all three types of World Cup medals (winners', runner- ups', and third-place); five players were from West Germany's squad of 1966\u20131974: Franz Beckenbauer, J\u00fcrgen Grabowski, Horst-Dieter H\u00f6ttges, Sepp Maier, and Wolfgang Overath (1966\u20131974), Italy's Franco Baresi (1982, 1990, 1994) and the most recent has been Miroslav Klose of Germany (2002\u20132014) with four consecutive medals.\nBrazil's M\u00e1rio Zagallo, West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer and France's Didier Deschamps are the only people to date to win the World Cup as both player and head coach. Zagallo won in 1958 and 1962 as a player and in 1970 as head coach. Beckenbauer won in 1974 as captain and in 1990 as head coach, and Deschamps repeated the feat in 2018, after having won in 1998 as captain. Italy's Vittorio Pozzo is the only head coach to ever win two World Cups (1934 and 1938). All World Cup-winning head coaches were natives of the country they coached to victory.\nAmong the national teams, Brazil has played the most World Cup matches (114), Germany appeared in the most finals (8), semi-finals (13), and quarter-finals (16), while Brazil has appeared in the most World Cups (22), has the most wins (76) and has scored the most goals (237). The two teams have played each other twice in the World Cup, in the 2002 final and in the 2014 semi-final.\nAwards.\nAt the end of each World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament."}
{"id": "11371", "revid": "1283290173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11371", "title": "Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus", "text": "Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (), surnamed Cunctator ( 280 \u2013 203 BC), was a Roman statesman and general of the third century BC. He was consul five times (233, 228, 215, 214, and 209 BC) and was appointed dictator in 221 and 217 BC. He was censor in 230 BC. His agnomen, \"Cunctator\", usually translated as \"the delayer\", refers to the strategy that he employed against Hannibal's forces during the Second Punic War. Facing an outstanding commander with superior numbers, he pursued a then-novel strategy of targeting the enemy's supply lines, and accepting only smaller engagements on favourable ground, rather than risking his entire army on direct confrontation with Hannibal himself. As a result, he is regarded as the originator of many tactics used in guerrilla warfare.\nBeginnings.\nBorn at Rome c. 280 BC, Fabius was a descendant of the ancient patrician Fabia gens. He was the son or grandson of Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges, three times consul and \"princeps senatus\", and grandson or great-grandson of Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, a hero of the Samnite Wars, who like Verrucosus held five consulships, as well as the offices of dictator and censor. Many earlier ancestors had also been consuls. His cognomen, \"Verrucosus\", or \"warty\", used to distinguish him from other members of his family, derived from a wart on his upper lip.\nAccording to Plutarch, Fabius possessed a mild temper and slow speech. As a child, he learned with difficulty, was cautious in sports and appeared timid in demeanor. Superficially, he seemed hapless, but Plutarch judges these as traits of a prudent and firm mind and a leonine temper. By the time he reached adulthood and was roused by the challenges of public life, his virtues exerted themselves.\nWhile still a youth in 265 BC, Fabius was consecrated an augur. It is unknown whether he participated in the First Punic War, fought between the Roman Republic and Carthage from 264 to 241 BC, or what his role might have been. Fabius' political career began in the years following that war. He was probably quaestor in 237 or 236 BC, and curule aedile about 235. During his first consulship, in 233 BC, Fabius was awarded a triumph for his victory over the Ligurians, whom he defeated and drove into the Alps. He was censor in 230, then consul a second time in 228. It is possible that he held the office of dictator for a first time around this time: according to Livy, Fabius's tenure of the dictatorship in 217 was his second term in that office, with Gaius Flaminius as his deputy and magister equitum during the first term: however Plutarch suggests that Flaminius was deputy instead to Marcus Minucius Rufus \u2013 presumably Fabius's great political rival of that name, who later served as deputy to Fabius himself (see below). It is of course possible that Flaminius was successively deputy to both, after Minucius's apparently premature deposition following bad augural omens: and also possible that little of note (other than, possibly, holding elections during the absence of consuls) was accomplished during either dictatorship.\nAccording to Livy, in 218 BC Fabius took part in an embassy to Carthage, sent to demand redress for the capture of the supposedly neutral town of Saguntum in Spain. Fabius then demanded that Hannibal and his officers would be turned over to Roman custody. The Carthaginian senate refused and Fabius held up two ends of his toga, one stood for peace, the other for war. He let the Carthaginian senate choose but they insisted that Fabius would decide. After the delegation had received the Carthaginians' reply, it was Fabius himself who, addressing the Carthaginian senate, issued a formal declaration of war between Carthage and the Roman Republic. However, Cassius Dio, followed by Zonaras, calls the ambassador \"Marcus Fabius\", suggesting that it was his cousin, Marcus Fabius Buteo, who issued the declaration of war against the Carthaginians.\nDictatorship during the Second Punic War.\nWhen the consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus was defeated in the Battle of the Trebia in December 218 BC, Fabius advised that the Romans should simply bide their time and deny Hannibal any chance at a general engagement, instead letting the invasion peter out while making sure the cities of their Italian Allies were supported or protected. However, consul Gaius Flaminius opposed this plan and joined his colleague Gnaeus Servilius Geminus in raising two consular armies to confront Hannibal in central Italy. Flaminius' plan came to a disastrous end when he was killed during the decisive Roman defeat at the Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217 BC, with panic sweeping Rome.\nWith consular armies destroyed in these two major battles, and Hannibal approaching Rome's gates, the Romans feared the imminent destruction of their city. The Roman Senate decided to appoint a dictator, and chose Fabius for the role \u2013 possibly for the second time, though evidence of a previous term seems to be conflicting \u2013 in part due to his advanced age and experience. However, he was not allowed to appoint his own Magister Equitum; instead, the Romans chose a political enemy, Marcus Minucius.\nFabius sought to calm the Roman people promptly by asserting himself as a strong dictator, in a crisis perceived as the worst in Roman history. He asked the Senate to allow him to ride on horseback, which dictators were never allowed to do. He then caused himself to be accompanied by the full complement of twenty-four lictors, and ordered the surviving consul, Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, to dismiss his lictors (in essence, acknowledging the seniority of the dictator), and to present himself before Fabius as a private citizen.\nPlutarch tells us that Fabius believed that the disaster at Lake Trasimene was due, in part, to the fact that the gods had become neglected. Before that battle, a series of omens had been witnessed, including a series of lightning bolts, which Fabius had believed were warnings from the gods. He had warned Flaminius of this, but Flaminius had ignored the warnings. And so Fabius, as dictator, next sought to please the gods. He ordered a massive sacrifice of the whole product of the next harvest season throughout Italy, in particular that of cows, goats, swine, and sheep. In addition, he ordered that musical festivities be celebrated, and then told his fellow citizens to each spend a precise sum of 333 sestertii and 333 denarii. Plutarch isn't sure exactly how Fabius came up with this number, although he believes it was to honor the perfection of the number three, as it is the first of the odd numbers and one of the first of the prime numbers. It is not known if Fabius truly believed that these actions had won the gods over to the Roman side, although the actions probably did (as intended) convince the average Roman that the gods had finally been won over.\nFabian strategy.\nFabius respected Hannibal's military genius and so refused to engage him directly in pitched battle. Instead, he kept his troops close to Hannibal, hoping to exhaust him in a long war of attrition. Fabius was able to harass the Carthaginian foraging parties, limiting Hannibal's ability to wreak destruction while conserving his own military force, and implementing a \"scorched earth\" practice to prevent Hannibal's forces from obtaining grain and other resources.\nThe Romans were unimpressed with this defensive strategy and at first gave Fabius his epithet Cunctator (delayer) as an insult. The strategy was in part ruined because of a lack of unity in the command of the Roman army, since Fabius' Master of the Horse, Minucius, was a political enemy of Fabius. At one point, Fabius was called by the priests to assist with certain sacrifices, so Fabius left the command of the army in the hands of Minucius during his absence. Fabius had told Minucius not to attack Hannibal in his absence, but Minucius disobeyed and attacked anyway.\nThe attack, though of no strategic value, resulted in the retreat of several enemy units, and so the Roman people, desperate for good news, believed Minucius to be a hero. On hearing of this, Fabius became enraged, and as dictator, could have ordered Minucius' execution for his disobedience. One of the plebeian tribunes (chief representatives of the people) for the year, Metilius, was a partisan of Minucius, and as such he sought to use his power to help Minucius. The plebeian tribunes were the only officials independent of the dictator, and so with his protection, Minucius was relatively safe. Plutarch states that Metilius \"boldly applied himself to the people in the behalf of Minucius\", and had Minucius granted powers equivalent to those of Fabius. By this, Plutarch probably means that as a plebeian tribune, Metilius had the Plebeian Council, a popular assembly which only tribunes could preside over, grant Minucius quasi-dictatorial powers.\nFabius did not attempt to fight the promotion of Minucius, but rather decided to wait until Minucius' rashness caused him to run headlong into some disaster. He realized what would happen when Minucius was defeated in battle by Hannibal. Fabius, we are told, reminded Minucius that it was Hannibal, and not he, who was the enemy. Minucius proposed that they share the joint control of the army, with command rotating between the two every other day. Fabius rejected this, and instead let Minucius command half of the army, while he commanded the other half. Minucius openly claimed that Fabius was cowardly because he failed to confront the Carthaginian forces.\nNear Larinum in Samnium, Hannibal had taken up position in a town called Geronium. In the leadup to the Battle of Geronium, Minucius decided to make a broad frontal attack on Hannibal's troops in the valley between Larinum and Geronium. Several thousand men were involved on either side. It appeared that the Roman troops were winning, but Hannibal had set a trap. Soon the Roman troops were being slaughtered. Upon seeing the ambush of Minucius' army, Fabius cried \"O Hercules! how much sooner than I expected, though later than he seemed to desire, hath Minucius destroyed himself!\" On ordering his army to join the battle and rescue their fellow Romans, Fabius exclaimed \"we must make haste to rescue Minucius, who is a valiant man, and a lover of his country.\"\nFabius rushed to his co-commander's assistance and Hannibal's forces immediately retreated. After the battle, there was some feeling that there would be conflict between Minucius and Fabius; however, the younger soldier marched his men to Fabius' encampment and is reported to have said, \"My father gave me life. Today you saved my life. You are my second father. I recognize your superior abilities as a commander.\" When Fabius' term as dictator ended, consular government was restored, and Gnaeus Servilius Geminus and Marcus Atilius Regulus assumed the consulship for the remainder of the year.\nThe once-looked-down-upon tactics employed by Fabius came then to be respected. It is said, asserts Plutarch, that even Hannibal acknowledged and feared the Fabian strategy and the Roman inexhaustible manpower. After Fabius lured him away from Apulia into the Bruttian territory and then proceeded to besiege Tarentum by treachery in 209 BC, Hannibal commented, \"It seems that the Romans have found another Hannibal, for we have lost Tarentum in the same way that we took it.\"\nAfter his dictatorship.\nShortly after Fabius had laid down his dictatorship, Gaius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paullus were elected as consuls. They rallied the people through the assemblies, and won their support for Varro's plan to abandon Fabius' strategy, and engage Hannibal directly. Varro's rashness did not surprise Fabius, but when Fabius learned of the size of the army (eighty-eight thousand soldiers) that Varro had raised, he became quite concerned. Unlike the losses that had been suffered by Minucius, a major loss by Varro had the potential to kill so many soldiers that Rome might have had no further resources with which to continue the war. Fabius had warned the other consul for the year, Aemilius Paullus, to make sure that Varro remained unable to directly engage Hannibal. According to Plutarch, Paullus replied to Fabius that he feared the votes in Rome more than Hannibal's army.\nWhen word reached Rome of the disastrous Roman defeat under Varro and Paullus at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC, the Senate and the People of Rome turned to Fabius for guidance. They had believed his strategy to be flawed before, but now they thought him to be as wise as the gods. He walked the streets of Rome, assured as to eventual Roman victory, in an attempt to comfort his fellow Romans. Without his support, the senate might have remained too frightened to even meet. He placed guards at the gates of the city to stop the frightened Romans from fleeing, and regulated mourning activities. He set times and places for this mourning, and ordered that each family perform such observances within their own private walls, and that the mourning should be complete within a month; following the completion of these mourning rituals, the entire city was purified of its blood-guilt in the deaths. Although he did not again hold the office of dictatorand indeed, it was granted to others over himhe might as well have been one unofficially at this time, because whatever measures he proposed were immediately adopted with little or no further debate.\nHonors and death.\n\"Cunctator\" became an honorific title, and his delaying tactic was followed in Italy for the rest of the war. Fabius' own military success was small, aside from the reconquest of Tarentum in 209 BC. For this victory, Plutarch tells us, he was awarded a second triumph that was even more splendid than the first. When Marcus Livius Macatus, the governor of Tarentum, claimed the merit of recovering the town, Fabius rejoined, \"Certainly, had you not lost it, I would have never retaken it.\" After serving as dictator, he served as a consul twice more (in 215 BC and 214 BC), and for a fifth time in 209 BC. He was also chief augur (at a very young age) and pontifex, but never \"pontifex maximus\" according to Gaius Stern (citing Livy on Fabius). The holding of seats in the two highest colleges was not repeated until either Julius Caesar or possibly Sulla.\nIn the senate, he opposed the young and ambitious Scipio Africanus, who wanted to carry the war to Africa. Fabius continued to argue that confronting Hannibal directly was too dangerous. Scipio planned to take Roman forces to Carthage itself and force Hannibal to return to Africa to defend the city. Scipio was eventually given limited approval, despite continuous opposition from Fabius, who blocked levies and restricted Scipio's access to troops. Fabius wished to ensure that sufficient forces remained to defend Roman territory if Scipio was defeated. Another motive mentioned by Plutarch was personal jealousy of Scipio's popularity, so that Fabius continued to argue against the African expedition even after its initial successes. Fabius became gravely ill and died in 203 BC, shortly after Hannibal's army left Italy, and before the eventual Roman victory over Hannibal at the Battle of Zama won by Scipio.\nPart of his eulogy is preserved on a fragment, which praised his delaying strategy in his altercations with Hannibal during the Second Punic War. The inscription reads as follows: \"...[as censor] he conducted the first revision of the senate membership and held committal elections in the consulship of Marcus Junius Pera and Marcus Barbula; he besieged and recaptured Tarentum and the strong-hold of Hannibal, and [obtained enormous booty?]; he won surpassing glory by his military [exploits?].\"\nLegacy.\nLater, he became a legendary figure and the model of a tough, courageous Roman, and was bestowed the honorific title, \"The Shield of Rome\" (similar to Marcus Claudius Marcellus being named the \"Sword of Rome\"). According to Ennius, \"unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem\"\"one man, by delaying, restored the state to us.\" Virgil, in the Aeneid, has Aeneas' father Anchises mention Fabius Maximus while in Hades as the greatest of the many great Fabii, quoting the same line. While Hannibal is mentioned in the company of history's greatest generals, military professionals have bestowed Fabius' name on an entire strategic doctrine known as \"Fabian strategy\", and George Washington has been called \"the American Fabius\". Mikhail Kutuzov has likewise been called \"the Russian Fabius\" for his strategy against Napoleon.\nAccording to its own ancient legend, the Roman princely family of Massimo descends from Fabius Maximus."}

{"id": "11376", "revid": "37569883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11376", "title": "Floating-point arithmetic", "text": "In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic on subsets of real numbers formed by a \"significand\" (a signed sequence of a fixed number of digits in some base) multiplied by an integer power of that base.\nNumbers of this form are called floating-point numbers.\nFor example, the number 2469/200 is a floating-point number in base ten with five digits:\nformula_1\nHowever, 7716/625 = 12.3456 is not a floating-point number in base ten with five digits\u2014it needs six digits.\nThe nearest floating-point number with only five digits is 12.346.\nAnd 1/3 = 0.3333\u2026 is not a floating-point number in base ten with any finite number of digits.\nIn practice, most floating-point systems use base two, though base ten (decimal floating point) is also common.\nFloating-point arithmetic operations, such as addition and division, approximate the corresponding real number arithmetic operations by rounding any result that is not a floating-point number itself to a nearby floating-point number.\nFor example, in a floating-point arithmetic with five base-ten digits, the sum 12.345 + 1.0001 = 13.3451 might be rounded to 13.345.\nThe term \"floating point\" refers to the fact that the number's radix point can \"float\" anywhere to the left, right, or between the significant digits of the number. This position is indicated by the exponent, so floating point can be considered a form of scientific notation.\nA floating-point system can be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of very different orders of magnitude \u2014 such as the number of meters between galaxies or between protons in an atom. For this reason, floating-point arithmetic is often used to allow very small and very large real numbers that require fast processing times. The result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers varies with their exponent.\nOver the years, a variety of floating-point representations have been used in computers. In 1985, the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic was established, and since the 1990s, the most commonly encountered representations are those defined by the IEEE.\nThe speed of floating-point operations, commonly measured in terms of FLOPS, is an important characteristic of a computer system, especially for applications that involve intensive mathematical calculations.\nA floating-point unit (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating-point numbers.\nOverview.\nFloating-point numbers.\nA number representation specifies some way of encoding a number, usually as a string of digits.\nThere are several mechanisms by which strings of digits can represent numbers. In standard mathematical notation, the digit string can be of any length, and the location of the radix point is indicated by placing an explicit \"point\" character (dot or comma) there. If the radix point is not specified, then the string implicitly represents an integer and the unstated radix point would be off the right-hand end of the string, next to the least significant digit. In fixed-point systems, a position in the string is specified for the radix point. So a fixed-point scheme might use a string of 8 decimal digits with the decimal point in the middle, whereby \"00012345\" would represent 0001.2345.\nIn scientific notation, the given number is scaled by a power of 10, so that it lies within a specific range\u2014typically between 1 and 10, with the radix point appearing immediately after the first digit. As a power of ten, the scaling factor is then indicated separately at the end of the number. For example, the orbital period of Jupiter's moon Io is seconds, a value that would be represented in standard-form scientific notation as seconds.\nFloating-point representation is similar in concept to scientific notation. Logically, a floating-point number consists of:\nTo derive the value of the floating-point number, the \"significand\" is multiplied by the \"base\" raised to the power of the \"exponent\", equivalent to shifting the radix point from its implied position by a number of places equal to the value of the exponent\u2014to the right if the exponent is positive or to the left if the exponent is negative.\nUsing base-10 (the familiar decimal notation) as an example, the number , which has ten decimal digits of precision, is represented as the significand together with 5 as the exponent. To determine the actual value, a decimal point is placed after the first digit of the significand and the result is multiplied by to give , or . In storing such a number, the base (10) need not be stored, since it will be the same for the entire range of supported numbers, and can thus be inferred.\nSymbolically, this final value is:\nformula_2\nwhere is the significand (ignoring any implied decimal point), is the precision (the number of digits in the significand), is the base (in our example, this is the number \"ten\"), and is the exponent.\nHistorically, several number bases have been used for representing floating-point numbers, with base two (binary) being the most common, followed by base ten (decimal floating point), and other less common varieties, such as base sixteen (hexadecimal floating point), base eight (octal floating point), base four (quaternary floating point), base three (balanced ternary floating point) and even base 256 and base .\nA floating-point number is a rational number, because it can be represented as one integer divided by another; for example is (145/100)\u00d71000 or /100. The base determines the fractions that can be represented; for instance, 1/5 cannot be represented exactly as a floating-point number using a binary base, but 1/5 can be represented exactly using a decimal base (, or ). However, 1/3 cannot be represented exactly by either binary (0.010101...) or decimal (0.333...), but in base 3, it is trivial (0.1 or 1\u00d73\u22121) . The occasions on which infinite expansions occur depend on the base and its prime factors.\nThe way in which the significand (including its sign) and exponent are stored in a computer is implementation-dependent. The common IEEE formats are described in detail later and elsewhere, but as an example, in the binary single-precision (32-bit) floating-point representation, formula_3, and so the significand is a string of 24 bits. For instance, the number \u03c0's first 33 bits are:\nformula_4\nIn this binary expansion, let us denote the positions from 0 (leftmost bit, or most significant bit) to 32 (rightmost bit). The 24-bit significand will stop at position\u00a023, shown as the underlined bit above. The next bit, at position\u00a024, is called the \"round bit\" or \"rounding bit\". It is used to round the 33-bit approximation to the nearest 24-bit number (there are specific rules for halfway values, which is not the case here). This bit, which is in this example, is added to the integer formed by the leftmost 24 bits, yielding:\nformula_5\nWhen this is stored in memory using the IEEE 754 encoding, this becomes the significand . The significand is assumed to have a binary point to the right of the leftmost bit. So, the binary representation of \u03c0 is calculated from left-to-right as follows:\nformula_6\nwhere is the precision ( in this example), is the position of the bit of the significand from the left (starting at and finishing at here) and is the exponent ( in this example).\nIt can be required that the most significant digit of the significand of a non-zero number be non-zero (except when the corresponding exponent would be smaller than the minimum one). This process is called \"normalization\". For binary formats (which uses only the digits and ), this non-zero digit is necessarily . Therefore, it does not need to be represented in memory, allowing the format to have one more bit of precision. This rule is variously called the \"leading bit convention\", the \"implicit bit convention\", the \"hidden bit convention\", or the \"assumed bit convention\".\nAlternatives to floating-point numbers.\nThe floating-point representation is by far the most common way of representing in computers an approximation to real numbers. However, there are alternatives:\nHistory.\nIn 1914, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo published \"Essays on Automatics\", where he designed a special-purpose electromechanical calculator based on Charles Babbage's analytical engine and described a way to store floating-point numbers in a consistent manner. He stated that numbers will be stored in exponential format as \"n\" x 10formula_10, and offered three rules by which consistent manipulation of floating-point numbers by machines could be implemented. For Torres, \"\"n\" will always be the same number of digits (e.g. six), the first digit of \"n\" will be of order of tenths, the second of hundredths, etc, and one will write each quantity in the form: \"n\"; \"m\".\" The format he proposed shows the need for a fixed-sized significand as is presently used for floating-point data, fixing the location of the decimal point in the significand so that each representation was unique, and how to format such numbers by specifying a syntax to be used that could be entered through a typewriter, as was the case of his Electromechanical Arithmometer in 1920. \nIn 1938, Konrad Zuse of Berlin completed the Z1, the first binary, programmable mechanical computer; it uses a 24-bit binary floating-point number representation with a 7-bit signed exponent, a 17-bit significand (including one implicit bit), and a sign bit. The more reliable relay-based Z3, completed in 1941, has representations for both positive and negative infinities; in particular, it implements defined operations with infinity, such as formula_11, and it stops on undefined operations, such as formula_12.\nZuse also proposed, but did not complete, carefully rounded floating-point arithmetic that includes formula_13 and NaN representations, anticipating features of the IEEE Standard by four decades. In contrast, von Neumann recommended against floating-point numbers for the 1951 IAS machine, arguing that fixed-point arithmetic is preferable.\nThe first \"commercial\" computer with floating-point hardware was Zuse's Z4 computer, designed in 1942\u20131945. In 1946, Bell Laboratories introduced the Model\u00a0V, which implemented decimal floating-point numbers.\nThe Pilot ACE has binary floating-point arithmetic, and it became operational in 1950 at National Physical Laboratory, UK. Thirty-three were later sold commercially as the English Electric DEUCE. The arithmetic is actually implemented in software, but with a one megahertz clock rate, the speed of floating-point and fixed-point operations in this machine were initially faster than those of many competing computers.\nThe mass-produced IBM 704 followed in 1954; it introduced the use of a biased exponent. For many decades after that, floating-point hardware was typically an optional feature, and computers that had it were said to be \"scientific computers\", or to have \"scientific computation\" (SC) capability (see also Extensions for Scientific Computation (XSC)). It was not until the launch of the Intel i486 in 1989 that \"general-purpose\" personal computers had floating-point capability in hardware as a standard feature.\nThe UNIVAC 1100/2200 series, introduced in 1962, supported two floating-point representations:\nThe IBM 7094, also introduced in 1962, supported single-precision and double-precision representations, but with no relation to the UNIVAC's representations. Indeed, in 1964, IBM introduced hexadecimal floating-point representations in its System/360 mainframes; these same representations are still available for use in modern z/Architecture systems. In 1998, IBM implemented IEEE-compatible binary floating-point arithmetic in its mainframes; in 2005, IBM also added IEEE-compatible decimal floating-point arithmetic.\nInitially, computers used many different representations for floating-point numbers. The lack of standardization at the mainframe level was an ongoing problem by the early 1970s for those writing and maintaining higher-level source code; these manufacturer floating-point standards differed in the word sizes, the representations, and the rounding behavior and general accuracy of operations. Floating-point compatibility across multiple computing systems was in desperate need of standardization by the early 1980s, leading to the creation of the IEEE 754 standard once the 32-bit (or 64-bit) word had become commonplace. This standard was significantly based on a proposal from Intel, which was designing the i8087 numerical coprocessor; Motorola, which was designing the 68000 around the same time, gave significant input as well.\nIn 1989, mathematician and computer scientist William Kahan was honored with the Turing Award for being the primary architect behind this proposal; he was aided by his student Jerome Coonen and a visiting professor, Harold Stone.\nAmong the x86 innovations are these:\nRange of floating-point numbers.\nA floating-point number consists of two fixed-point components, whose range depends exclusively on the number of bits or digits in their representation. Whereas components linearly depend on their range, the floating-point range linearly depends on the significand range and exponentially on the range of exponent component, which attaches outstandingly wider range to the number.\nOn a typical computer system, a \"double-precision\" (64-bit) binary floating-point number has a coefficient of 53 bits (including 1 implied bit), an exponent of 11 bits, and 1 sign bit. Since 210 = 1024, the complete range of the positive normal floating-point numbers in this format is from 2\u22121022\u00a0\u2248\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212308 to approximately 21024\u00a0\u2248\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010308.\nThe number of normal floating-point numbers in a system (\"B\", \"P\", \"L\", \"U\") where\nis formula_14.\nThere is a smallest positive normal floating-point number,\nwhich has a 1 as the leading digit and 0 for the remaining digits of the significand, and the smallest possible value for the exponent.\nThere is a largest floating-point number,\nwhich has \"B\" \u2212 1 as the value for each digit of the significand and the largest possible value for the exponent.\nIn addition, there are representable values strictly between \u2212UFL and UFL. Namely, positive and negative zeros, as well as subnormal numbers.\nIEEE 754: floating point in modern computers.\nThe IEEE standardized the computer representation for binary floating-point numbers in IEEE 754 (a.k.a. IEC 60559) in 1985. This first standard is followed by almost all modern machines. It was revised in 2008. IBM mainframes support IBM's own hexadecimal floating point format and IEEE 754-2008 decimal floating point in addition to the IEEE 754 binary format. The Cray T90 series had an IEEE version, but the SV1 still uses Cray floating-point format.\nThe standard provides for many closely related formats, differing in only a few details. Five of these formats are called \"basic formats\", and others are termed \"extended precision formats\" and \"extendable precision format\". Three formats are especially widely used in computer hardware and languages:\nIncreasing the precision of the floating-point representation generally reduces the amount of accumulated round-off error caused by intermediate calculations.\nOther IEEE formats include:\nAny integer with absolute value less than 224 can be exactly represented in the single-precision format, and any integer with absolute value less than 253 can be exactly represented in the double-precision format. Furthermore, a wide range of powers of 2 times such a number can be represented. These properties are sometimes used for purely integer data, to get 53-bit integers on platforms that have double-precision floats but only 32-bit integers.\nThe standard specifies some special values, and their representation: positive infinity (), negative infinity (), a negative zero (\u22120) distinct from ordinary (\"positive\") zero, and \"not a number\" values (NaNs).\nComparison of floating-point numbers, as defined by the IEEE standard, is a bit different from usual integer comparison. Negative and positive zero compare equal, and every NaN compares unequal to every value, including itself. All finite floating-point numbers are strictly smaller than and strictly greater than , and they are ordered in the same way as their values (in the set of real numbers).\nInternal representation.\nFloating-point numbers are typically packed into a computer datum as the sign bit, the exponent field, and the significand or mantissa, from left to right. For the IEEE 754 binary formats (basic and extended) that have extant hardware implementations, they are apportioned as follows:\nWhile the exponent can be positive or negative, in binary formats it is stored as an unsigned number that has a fixed \"bias\" added to it. Values of all 0s in this field are reserved for the zeros and subnormal numbers; values of all 1s are reserved for the infinities and NaNs. The exponent range for normal numbers is [\u2212126, 127] for single precision, [\u22121022, 1023] for double, or [\u221216382, 16383] for quad. Normal numbers exclude subnormal values, zeros, infinities, and NaNs.\nIn the IEEE binary interchange formats the leading bit of a normalized significand is not actually stored in the computer datum, since it is always 1. It is called the \"hidden\" or \"implicit\" bit. Because of this, the single-precision format actually has a significand with 24 bits of precision, the double-precision format has 53, and quad has 113.\nFor example, it was shown above that \u03c0, rounded to 24 bits of precision, has:\nThe sum of the exponent bias (127) and the exponent (1) is 128, so this is represented in the single-precision format as\nAn example of a layout for 32-bit floating point is\nand the 64-bit (\"double\") layout is similar.\nOther notable floating-point formats.\nIn addition to the widely used IEEE 754 standard formats, other floating-point formats are used, or have been used, in certain domain-specific areas.\nRepresentable numbers, conversion and rounding.\nBy their nature, all numbers expressed in floating-point format are rational numbers with a terminating expansion in the relevant base (for example, a terminating decimal expansion in base-10, or a terminating binary expansion in base-2). Irrational numbers, such as \u03c0 or formula_17, or non-terminating rational numbers, must be approximated. The number of digits (or bits) of precision also limits the set of rational numbers that can be represented exactly. For example, the decimal number 123456789 cannot be exactly represented if only eight decimal digits of precision are available (it would be rounded to one of the two straddling representable values, 12345678\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101 or 12345679\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101), the same applies to non-terminating digits (. to be rounded to either .55555555 or .55555556).\nWhen a number is represented in some format (such as a character string) which is not a native floating-point representation supported in a computer implementation, then it will require a conversion before it can be used in that implementation. If the number can be represented exactly in the floating-point format then the conversion is exact. If there is not an exact representation then the conversion requires a choice of which floating-point number to use to represent the original value. The representation chosen will have a different value from the original, and the value thus adjusted is called the \"rounded value\".\nWhether or not a rational number has a terminating expansion depends on the base. For example, in base-10 the number 1/2 has a terminating expansion (0.5) while the number 1/3 does not (0.333...). In base-2 only rationals with denominators that are powers of 2 (such as 1/2 or 3/16) are terminating. Any rational with a denominator that has a prime factor other than 2 will have an infinite binary expansion. This means that numbers that appear to be short and exact when written in decimal format may need to be approximated when converted to binary floating-point. For example, the decimal number 0.1 is not representable in binary floating-point of any finite precision; the exact binary representation would have a \"1100\" sequence continuing endlessly:\nwhere, as previously, \"s\" is the significand and \"e\" is the exponent.\nWhen rounded to 24 bits this becomes\nwhich is actually 0.100000001490116119384765625 in decimal.\nAs a further example, the real number \u03c0, represented in binary as an infinite sequence of bits is\nbut is\nwhen approximated by rounding to a precision of 24 bits.\nIn binary single-precision floating-point, this is represented as \"s\"\u00a0=\u00a01.10010010000111111011011 with \"e\"\u00a0=\u00a01.\nThis has a decimal value of\nwhereas a more accurate approximation of the true value of \u03c0 is\nThe result of rounding differs from the true value by about 0.03 parts per million, and matches the decimal representation of \u03c0 in the first 7 digits. The difference is the discretization error and is limited by the machine epsilon.\nThe arithmetical difference between two consecutive representable floating-point numbers which have the same exponent is called a unit in the last place (ULP). For example, if there is no representable number lying between the representable numbers 1.45A70C2216 and 1.45A70C2416, the ULP is 2\u00d716\u22128, or 2\u221231. For numbers with a base-2 exponent part of 0, i.e. numbers with an absolute value higher than or equal to 1 but lower than 2, an ULP is exactly 2\u221223 or about 10\u22127 in single precision, and exactly 2\u221253 or about 10\u221216 in double precision. The mandated behavior of IEEE-compliant hardware is that the result be within one-half of a ULP.\nRounding modes.\nRounding is used when the exact result of a floating-point operation (or a conversion to floating-point format) would need more digits than there are digits in the significand. IEEE 754 requires \"correct rounding\": that is, the rounded result is as if infinitely precise arithmetic was used to compute the value and then rounded (although in implementation only three extra bits are needed to ensure this). There are several different rounding schemes (or \"rounding modes\"). Historically, truncation was the typical approach. Since the introduction of IEEE 754, the default method (\"round to nearest, ties to even\", sometimes called Banker's Rounding) is more commonly used. This method rounds the ideal (infinitely precise) result of an arithmetic operation to the nearest representable value, and gives that representation as the result. In the case of a tie, the value that would make the significand end in an even digit is chosen. The IEEE 754 standard requires the same rounding to be applied to all fundamental algebraic operations, including square root and conversions, when there is a numeric (non-NaN) result. It means that the results of IEEE 754 operations are completely determined in all bits of the result, except for the representation of NaNs. (\"Library\" functions such as cosine and log are not mandated.)\nAlternative rounding options are also available. IEEE 754 specifies the following rounding modes:\nAlternative modes are useful when the amount of error being introduced must be bounded. Applications that require a bounded error are multi-precision floating-point, and interval arithmetic.\nThe alternative rounding modes are also useful in diagnosing numerical instability: if the results of a subroutine vary substantially between rounding to + and \u2212 infinity then it is likely numerically unstable and affected by round-off error.\nBinary-to-decimal conversion with minimal number of digits.\nConverting a double-precision binary floating-point number to a decimal string is a common operation, but an algorithm producing results that are both accurate and minimal did not appear in print until 1990, with Steele and White's Dragon4. Some of the improvements since then include:\nMany modern language runtimes use Grisu3 with a Dragon4 fallback.\nDecimal-to-binary conversion.\nThe problem of parsing a decimal string into a binary FP representation is complex, with an accurate parser not appearing until Clinger's 1990 work (implemented in dtoa.c). Further work has likewise progressed in the direction of faster parsing.\nFloating-point operations.\nFor ease of presentation and understanding, decimal radix with 7 digit precision will be used in the examples, as in the IEEE 754 \"decimal32\" format. The fundamental principles are the same in any radix or precision, except that normalization is optional (it does not affect the numerical value of the result). Here, \"s\" denotes the significand and \"e\" denotes the exponent.\nAddition and subtraction.\nA simple method to add floating-point numbers is to first represent them with the same exponent. In the example below, the second number (with the smaller exponent) is shifted right by three digits, and one then proceeds with the usual addition method:\n 123456.7 = 1.234567 \u00d7 10^5\n 101.7654 = 1.017654 \u00d7 10^2 = 0.001017654 \u00d7 10^5\n Hence:\n 123456.7 + 101.7654 = (1.234567 \u00d7 10^5) + (1.017654 \u00d7 10^2)\n = (1.234567 \u00d7 10^5) + (0.001017654 \u00d7 10^5)\n = (1.234567 + 0.001017654) \u00d7 10^5\n = 1.235584654 \u00d7 10^5\nIn detail:\n e=5; s=1.234567 (123456.7)\n + e=2; s=1.017654 (101.7654)\n e=5; s=1.234567\n + e=5; s=0.001017654 (after shifting)\n e=5; s=1.235584654 (true sum: 123558.4654)\nThis is the true result, the exact sum of the operands. It will be rounded to seven digits and then normalized if necessary. The final result is\n e=5; s=1.235585 (final sum: 123558.5)\nThe lowest three digits of the second operand (654) are essentially lost. This is round-off error. In extreme cases, the sum of two non-zero numbers may be equal to one of them:\n e=5; s=1.234567\n + e=\u22123; s=9.876543\n e=5; s=1.234567\n + e=5; s=0.00000009876543 (after shifting)\n e=5; s=1.23456709876543 (true sum)\n e=5; s=1.234567 (after rounding and normalization)\nIn the above conceptual examples it would appear that a large number of extra digits would need to be provided by the adder to ensure correct rounding; however, for binary addition or subtraction using careful implementation techniques only a \"guard\" bit, a \"rounding\" bit and one extra \"sticky\" bit need to be carried beyond the precision of the operands.\nAnother problem of loss of significance occurs when \"approximations\" to two nearly equal numbers are subtracted. In the following example \"e\"\u00a0=\u00a05; \"s\"\u00a0=\u00a01.234571 and \"e\"\u00a0=\u00a05; \"s\"\u00a0=\u00a01.234567 are approximations to the rationals 123457.1467 and 123456.659.\n e=5; s=1.234571\n \u2212 e=5; s=1.234567\n e=5; s=0.000004\n e=\u22121; s=4.000000 (after rounding and normalization)\nThe floating-point difference is computed exactly because the numbers are close\u2014the Sterbenz lemma guarantees this, even in case of underflow when gradual underflow is supported. Despite this, the difference of the original numbers is \"e\"\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121; \"s\"\u00a0=\u00a04.877000, which differs more than 20% from the difference \"e\"\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121; \"s\"\u00a0=\u00a04.000000 of the approximations. In extreme cases, all significant digits of precision can be lost. This \"cancellation\" illustrates the danger in assuming that all of the digits of a computed result are meaningful. Dealing with the consequences of these errors is a topic in numerical analysis; see also Accuracy problems.\nMultiplication and division.\nTo multiply, the significands are multiplied while the exponents are added, and the result is rounded and normalized.\n e=3; s=4.734612\n \u00d7 e=5; s=5.417242\n e=8; s=25.648538980104 (true product)\n e=8; s=25.64854 (after rounding)\n e=9; s=2.564854 (after normalization)\nSimilarly, division is accomplished by subtracting the divisor's exponent from the dividend's exponent, and dividing the dividend's significand by the divisor's significand.\nThere are no cancellation or absorption problems with multiplication or division, though small errors may accumulate as operations are performed in succession. In practice, the way these operations are carried out in digital logic can be quite complex (see Booth's multiplication algorithm and Division algorithm).\nLiteral syntax.\nLiterals for floating-point numbers depend on languages. They typically use codice_1 or codice_2 to denote scientific notation. The C programming language and the IEEE 754 standard also define a hexadecimal literal syntax with a base-2 exponent instead of 10. In languages like C, when the decimal exponent is omitted, a decimal point is needed to differentiate them from integers. Other languages do not have an integer type (such as JavaScript), or allow overloading of numeric types (such as Haskell). In these cases, digit strings such as codice_3 may also be floating-point literals.\nExamples of floating-point literals are:\nDealing with exceptional cases.\nFloating-point computation in a computer can run into three kinds of problems:\nPrior to the IEEE standard, such conditions usually caused the program to terminate, or triggered some kind of trap that the programmer might be able to catch. How this worked was system-dependent, meaning that floating-point programs were not portable. (The term \"exception\" as used in IEEE 754 is a general term meaning an exceptional condition, which is not necessarily an error, and is a different usage to that typically defined in programming languages such as a C++ or Java, in which an \"exception\" is an alternative flow of control, closer to what is termed a \"trap\" in IEEE 754 terminology.)\nHere, the required default method of handling exceptions according to IEEE 754 is discussed (the IEEE 754 optional trapping and other \"alternate exception handling\" modes are not discussed). Arithmetic exceptions are (by default) required to be recorded in \"sticky\" status flag bits. That they are \"sticky\" means that they are not reset by the next (arithmetic) operation, but stay set until explicitly reset. The use of \"sticky\" flags thus allows for testing of exceptional conditions to be delayed until after a full floating-point expression or subroutine: without them exceptional conditions that could not be otherwise ignored would require explicit testing immediately after every floating-point operation. By default, an operation always returns a result according to specification without interrupting computation. For instance, 1/0 returns +\u221e, while also setting the divide-by-zero flag bit (this default of \u221e is designed to often return a finite result when used in subsequent operations and so be safely ignored).\nThe original IEEE 754 standard, however, failed to recommend operations to handle such sets of arithmetic exception flag bits. So while these were implemented in hardware, initially programming language implementations typically did not provide a means to access them (apart from assembler). Over time some programming language standards (e.g., C99/C11 and Fortran) have been updated to specify methods to access and change status flag bits. The 2008 version of the IEEE 754 standard now specifies a few operations for accessing and handling the arithmetic flag bits. The programming model is based on a single thread of execution and use of them by multiple threads has to be handled by a means outside of the standard (e.g. C11 specifies that the flags have thread-local storage).\nIEEE 754 specifies five arithmetic exceptions that are to be recorded in the status flags (\"sticky bits\"):\nThe default return value for each of the exceptions is designed to give the correct result in the majority of cases such that the exceptions can be ignored in the majority of codes. \"inexact\" returns a correctly rounded result, and \"underflow\" returns a value less than or equal to the smallest positive normal number in magnitude and can almost always be ignored. \"divide-by-zero\" returns infinity exactly, which will typically then divide a finite number and so give zero, or else will give an \"invalid\" exception subsequently if not, and so can also typically be ignored. For example, the effective resistance of n resistors in parallel (see fig. 1) is given by formula_18. If a short-circuit develops with formula_19 set to 0, formula_20 will return +infinity which will give a final formula_21 of 0, as expected (see the continued fraction example of for another example).\n\"Overflow\" and \"invalid\" exceptions can typically not be ignored, but do not necessarily represent errors: for example, a root-finding routine, as part of its normal operation, may evaluate a passed-in function at values outside of its domain, returning NaN and an \"invalid\" exception flag to be ignored until finding a useful start point.\nAccuracy problems.\nThe fact that floating-point numbers cannot accurately represent all real numbers, and that floating-point operations cannot accurately represent true arithmetic operations, leads to many surprising situations. This is related to the finite precision with which computers generally represent numbers.\nFor example, the decimal numbers 0.1 and 0.01 cannot be represented exactly as binary floating-point numbers. In the IEEE 754 binary32 format with its 24-bit significand, the result of attempting to square the approximation to 0.1 is neither 0.01 nor the representable number closest to it. The decimal number 0.1 is represented in binary as ; , which is\nSquaring this number gives\nSquaring it with rounding to the 24-bit precision gives\nBut the representable number closest to 0.01 is\nAlso, the non-representability of \u03c0 (and \u03c0/2) means that an attempted computation of tan(\u03c0/2) will not yield a result of infinity, nor will it even overflow in the usual floating-point formats (assuming an accurate implementation of tan). It is simply not possible for standard floating-point hardware to attempt to compute tan(\u03c0/2), because \u03c0/2 cannot be represented exactly. This computation in C:\n/* Enough digits to be sure we get the correct approximation. */\ndouble pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795;\ndouble z = tan(pi/2.0);\nwill give a result of 16331239353195370.0. In single precision (using the codice_9 function), the result will be \u221222877332.0.\nBy the same token, an attempted computation of sin(\u03c0) will not yield zero. The result will be (approximately) 0.1225 in double precision, or \u22120.8742 in single precision.\nWhile floating-point addition and multiplication are both commutative ( and ), they are not necessarily associative. That is, is not necessarily equal to . Using 7-digit significand decimal arithmetic:\n a = 1234.567, b = 45.67834, c = 0.0004\n (a + b) + c:\n 1234.567 (a)\n + 45.67834 (b)\n ____________\n 1280.24534 rounds to 1280.245\n 1280.245 (a + b)\n + 0.0004 (c)\n ____________\n 1280.2454 rounds to 1280.245 \u2190 (a + b) + c\n a + (b + c):\n 45.67834 (b)\n + 0.0004 (c)\n ____________\n 45.67874\n 1234.567 (a)\n + 45.67874 (b + c)\n ____________\n 1280.24574 rounds to 1280.246 \u2190 a + (b + c)\nThey are also not necessarily distributive. That is, may not be the same as :\n 1234.567 \u00d7 3.333333 = 4115.223\n 1.234567 \u00d7 3.333333 = 4.115223\n 4115.223 + 4.115223 = 4119.338\n but\n 1234.567 + 1.234567 = 1235.802\n 1235.802 \u00d7 3.333333 = 4119.340\nIn addition to loss of significance, inability to represent numbers such as \u03c0 and 0.1 exactly, and other slight inaccuracies, the following phenomena may occur:\nMachine precision and backward error analysis.\n\"Machine precision\" is a quantity that characterizes the accuracy of a floating-point system, and is used in backward error analysis of floating-point algorithms. It is also known as unit roundoff or \"machine epsilon\". Usually denoted , its value depends on the particular rounding being used.\nWith rounding to zero,\nformula_22\nwhereas rounding to nearest,\nformula_23\nwhere \"B\" is the base of the system and \"P\" is the precision of the significand (in base \"B\").\nThis is important since it bounds the \"relative error\" in representing any non-zero real number within the normalized range of a floating-point system:\nformula_24\nBackward error analysis, the theory of which was developed and popularized by James H. Wilkinson, can be used to establish that an algorithm implementing a numerical function is numerically stable. The basic approach is to show that although the calculated result, due to roundoff errors, will not be exactly correct, it is the exact solution to a nearby problem with slightly perturbed input data. If the perturbation required is small, on the order of the uncertainty in the input data, then the results are in some sense as accurate as the data \"deserves\". The algorithm is then defined as \"backward stable\". Stability is a measure of the sensitivity to rounding errors of a given numerical procedure; by contrast, the condition number of a function for a given problem indicates the inherent sensitivity of the function to small perturbations in its input and is independent of the implementation used to solve the problem.\nAs a trivial example, consider a simple expression giving the inner product of (length two) vectors formula_25 and formula_26, then\nformula_27\nand so\nformula_28\nwhere\nformula_29\nwhere\nformula_30\nby definition, which is the sum of two slightly perturbed (on the order of \u0395mach) input data, and so is backward stable. For more realistic examples in numerical linear algebra, see Higham 2002 and other references below.\nMinimizing the effect of accuracy problems.\nAlthough individual arithmetic operations of IEEE 754 are guaranteed accurate to within half a ULP, more complicated formulae can suffer from larger errors for a variety of reasons. The loss of accuracy can be substantial if a problem or its data are ill-conditioned, meaning that the correct result is hypersensitive to tiny perturbations in its data. However, even functions that are well-conditioned can suffer from large loss of accuracy if an algorithm numerically unstable for that data is used: apparently equivalent formulations of expressions in a programming language can differ markedly in their numerical stability. One approach to remove the risk of such loss of accuracy is the design and analysis of numerically stable algorithms, which is an aim of the branch of mathematics known as numerical analysis. Another approach that can protect against the risk of numerical instabilities is the computation of intermediate (scratch) values in an algorithm at a higher precision than the final result requires, which can remove, or reduce by orders of magnitude, such risk: IEEE 754 quadruple precision and extended precision are designed for this purpose when computing at double precision.\nFor example, the following algorithm is a direct implementation to compute the function which is well-conditioned at 1.0, however it can be shown to be numerically unstable and lose up to half the significant digits carried by the arithmetic when computed near 1.0.\ndouble A(double X)\n double Y, Z; // [1]\n Y = X - 1.0;\n Z = exp(Y);\n if (Z != 1.0)\n Z = Y / (Z - 1.0); // [2]\n return Z;\nIf, however, intermediate computations are all performed in extended precision (e.g. by setting line [1] to C99 ), then up to full precision in the final double result can be maintained. Alternatively, a numerical analysis of the algorithm reveals that if the following non-obvious change to line [2] is made:\nZ = log(Z) / (Z - 1.0);\nthen the algorithm becomes numerically stable and can compute to full double precision.\nTo maintain the properties of such carefully constructed numerically stable programs, careful handling by the compiler is required. Certain \"optimizations\" that compilers might make (for example, reordering operations) can work against the goals of well-behaved software. There is some controversy about the failings of compilers and language designs in this area: C99 is an example of a language where such optimizations are carefully specified to maintain numerical precision. See the external references at the bottom of this article.\nA detailed treatment of the techniques for writing high-quality floating-point software is beyond the scope of this article, and the reader is referred to, and the other references at the bottom of this article. Kahan suggests several rules of thumb that can substantially decrease by orders of magnitude the risk of numerical anomalies, in addition to, or in lieu of, a more careful numerical analysis. These include: as noted above, computing all expressions and intermediate results in the highest precision supported in hardware (a common rule of thumb is to carry twice the precision of the desired result, i.e. compute in double precision for a final single-precision result, or in double extended or quad precision for up to double-precision results); and rounding input data and results to only the precision required and supported by the input data (carrying excess precision in the final result beyond that required and supported by the input data can be misleading, increases storage cost and decreases speed, and the excess bits can affect convergence of numerical procedures: notably, the first form of the iterative example given below converges correctly when using this rule of thumb). Brief descriptions of several additional issues and techniques follow.\nAs decimal fractions can often not be exactly represented in binary floating-point, such arithmetic is at its best when it is simply being used to measure real-world quantities over a wide range of scales (such as the orbital period of a moon around Saturn or the mass of a proton), and at its worst when it is expected to model the interactions of quantities expressed as decimal strings that are expected to be exact. An example of the latter case is financial calculations. For this reason, financial software tends not to use a binary floating-point number representation. The \"decimal\" data type of the C# and Python programming languages, and the decimal formats of the IEEE 754-2008 standard, are designed to avoid the problems of binary floating-point representations when applied to human-entered exact decimal values, and make the arithmetic always behave as expected when numbers are printed in decimal.\nExpectations from mathematics may not be realized in the field of floating-point computation. For example, it is known that formula_31, and that formula_32, however these facts cannot be relied on when the quantities involved are the result of floating-point computation.\nThe use of the equality test (codice_10) requires care when dealing with floating-point numbers. Even simple expressions like codice_11 will, on most computers, fail to be true (in IEEE 754 double precision, for example, codice_12 is approximately equal to ). Consequently, such tests are sometimes replaced with \"fuzzy\" comparisons (codice_13, where epsilon is sufficiently small and tailored to the application, such as 1.0E\u221213). The wisdom of doing this varies greatly, and can require numerical analysis to bound epsilon. Values derived from the primary data representation and their comparisons should be performed in a wider, extended, precision to minimize the risk of such inconsistencies due to round-off errors. It is often better to organize the code in such a way that such tests are unnecessary. For example, in computational geometry, exact tests of whether a point lies off or on a line or plane defined by other points can be performed using adaptive precision or exact arithmetic methods.\nSmall errors in floating-point arithmetic can grow when mathematical algorithms perform operations an enormous number of times. A few examples are matrix inversion, eigenvector computation, and differential equation solving. These algorithms must be very carefully designed, using numerical approaches such as iterative refinement, if they are to work well.\nSummation of a vector of floating-point values is a basic algorithm in scientific computing, and so an awareness of when loss of significance can occur is essential. For example, if one is adding a very large number of numbers, the individual addends are very small compared with the sum. This can lead to loss of significance. A typical addition would then be something like\n 3253.671\n + 3.141276\n 3256.812\nThe low 3 digits of the addends are effectively lost. Suppose, for example, that one needs to add many numbers, all approximately equal to 3. After 1000 of them have been added, the running sum is about 3000; the lost digits are not regained. The Kahan summation algorithm may be used to reduce the errors.\nRound-off error can affect the convergence and accuracy of iterative numerical procedures. As an example, Archimedes approximated \u03c0 by calculating the perimeters of polygons inscribing and circumscribing a circle, starting with hexagons, and successively doubling the number of sides. As noted above, computations may be rearranged in a way that is mathematically equivalent but less prone to error (numerical analysis). Two forms of the recurrence formula for the circumscribed polygon are:\nHere is a computation using IEEE \"double\" (a significand with 53 bits of precision) arithmetic:\n i 6 \u00d7 2i \u00d7 ti, first form 6 \u00d7 2i \u00d7 ti, second form\n 0 '.4641016151377543863 '.4641016151377543863\n 1 '.2153903091734710173 '.2153903091734723496\n 2 '596599420974940120 '596599420975006733\n 3 '60862151314012979 '60862151314352708\n 4 '27145996453136334 '27145996453689225\n 5 '8730499801259536 '8730499798241950\n 6 '6627470548084133 '6627470568494473\n 7 '6101765997805905 '6101766046906629\n 8 '70343230776862 '70343215275928\n 9 '37488171150615 '37487713536668\n 10 '9278733740748 '9273850979885\n 11 '7256228504127 '7220386148377\n 12 '717412858693 '707019992125\n 13 '189011456060 '78678454728\n 14 '717412858693 '46593073709\n 15 '19358822321783 '8571730119\n 16 '717412858693 '6566394222\n 17 '810075796233302 '6065061913\n 18 '717412858693 '939728836\n 19 '4061547378810956 '908393901\n 20 '05434924008406305 '900560168\n 21 '00068646912273617 '8608396\n 22 '349453756585929919 '8122118\n 23 '00068646912273617 '95552\n 24 '.2245152435345525443 '68907\n 25 62246\n 26 62246\n 27 62246\n 28 62246\n The true value is \nWhile the two forms of the recurrence formula are clearly mathematically equivalent, the first subtracts 1 from a number extremely close to 1, leading to an increasingly problematic loss of significant digits. As the recurrence is applied repeatedly, the accuracy improves at first, but then it deteriorates. It never gets better than about 8 digits, even though 53-bit arithmetic should be capable of about 16 digits of precision. When the second form of the recurrence is used, the value converges to 15 digits of precision.\n\"Fast math\" optimization.\nThe aforementioned lack of associativity of floating-point operations in general means that compilers cannot as effectively reorder arithmetic expressions as they could with integer and fixed-point arithmetic, presenting a roadblock in optimizations such as common subexpression elimination and auto-vectorization. The \"fast math\" option on many compilers (ICC, GCC, Clang, MSVC...) turns on reassociation along with unsafe assumptions such as a lack of NaN and infinite numbers in IEEE 754. Some compilers also offer more granular options to only turn on reassociation. In either case, the programmer is exposed to many of the precision pitfalls mentioned above for the portion of the program using \"fast\" math.\nIn some compilers (GCC and Clang), turning on \"fast\" math may cause the program to disable subnormal floats at startup, affecting the floating-point behavior of not only the generated code, but also any program using such code as a library.\nIn most Fortran compilers, as allowed by the ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004 Fortran standard, reassociation is the default, with breakage largely prevented by the \"protect parens\" setting (also on by default). This setting stops the compiler from reassociating beyond the boundaries of parentheses. Intel Fortran Compiler is a notable outlier.\nA common problem in \"fast\" math is that subexpressions may not be optimized identically from place to place, leading to unexpected differences. One interpretation of the issue is that \"fast\" math as implemented currently has a poorly defined semantics. One attempt at formalizing \"fast\" math optimizations is seen in \"Icing\", a verified compiler."}
{"id": "11378", "revid": "1994682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11378", "title": "First Epistle to the Corinthians", "text": "The First Epistle to the Corinthians () is one of the Pauline epistles, part of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle is attributed to Paul the Apostle and a co-author, Sosthenes, and is addressed to the Christian church in Corinth. Scholars believe that Sosthenes was the amanuensis who wrote down the text of the letter at Paul's direction. It addresses various issues which had arisen in the Christian community at Corinth and is composed in a form of Koine Greek. Despite the name, it is not believed to be the first such letter written to the Corinthian church.\nAuthorship.\nThere is a consensus among historians and theologians that Paul is the author of the First Epistle to the Corinthians, with Sosthenes as its co-author. Protestant commentator Heinrich Meyer notes that Sosthenes' inclusion in the opening wording shows that he made a greater contribution to the letter than being a \"mere amanuensis\". Meyer observes that \"in a subordinate sense\", its recipients \"were to regard the letter of the apostle as at the same time a letter of Sosthenes, who thereby signified his desire to impress upon them the same doctrines, admonitions, etc. This presupposes that Paul had previously considered and discussed with this friend of his the contents of the letter to be issued.\"\nThe letter is quoted or mentioned by the earliest of sources and is included in every ancient canon, including that of Marcion of Sinope. Some scholars point to the epistle's potentially embarrassing references to the existence of sexual immorality in the church as strengthening the case for the authenticity of the letter. However, the epistle does contain a passage which is widely believed to have been interpolated into the text by a later scribe:\nVerses 34\u201335 are included in all extant manuscripts. Part of the reason for suspecting that this passage is an interpolation is that in several manuscripts in the Western tradition, it is placed at the end of chapter 14 instead of at its canonical location. This kind of variability is generally considered by textual critics to be a sign that a note, initially placed in the margins of the document, has been copied into the body of the text by a scribe. As E. Earle Ellis and Daniel B. Wallace note, however, a marginal note may well have been written by Paul himself. The loss of marginal arrows or other directional devices could explain why the scribe of the Western \"Vorlage\" placed it at the end of the chapter. The absence of an asterisk or obelisk in the margin of any manuscript \u2013 a common way of indicating doubt of authenticity \u2013 they argue, a strong argument that Paul wrote the passage and intended it in its traditional place. The passage has also been taken to contradict 11:5, where women are described as praying and prophesying in church.\nFurthermore, some scholars believe that the passage 1 Corinthians 10:1\u201322 constitutes a separate letter fragment or scribal interpolation because it equates the consumption of meat sacrificed to idols with idolatry, while Paul seems to be more lenient on this issue in 8:1\u201313 and 10:23\u201311:1. Such views are rejected by other scholars who give arguments for the unity of 8:1\u201311:1.\nComposition.\nAbout the year AD 50, towards the end of his second missionary journey, Paul founded the church in Corinth before moving on to Ephesus, a city on the west coast of today's Turkey, about by sea from Corinth. From there he traveled to Caesarea and Antioch. Paul returned to Ephesus on his third missionary journey and spent approximately three years there. It was while staying in Ephesus that he received disconcerting news of the community in Corinth regarding jealousies, rivalry, and immoral behavior. It also appears that, based on a letter the Corinthians sent Paul, the congregation was requesting clarification on a number of matters, such as marriage and the consumption of meat previously offered to idols.\nBy comparing Acts of the Apostles 18:1\u201317 and the references to Ephesus in the Corinthian correspondence, scholars suggest that the letter was written during Paul's stay in Ephesus, which is usually dated as being in the range of AD 53\u201357.\nAnthony C. Thiselton suggests that it is possible that 1 Corinthians was written during Paul's first (brief) stay in Ephesus, at the end of his second journey, usually dated to early AD 54. However, it is more likely that it was written during his extended stay in Ephesus, where he refers to sending Timothy to them.\nDespite the attributed title \"1 Corinthians\", this letter was not the first written by Paul to the church in Corinth, only the first canonical letter. 1 Corinthians is the second known letter of four from Paul to the church in Corinth, as evidenced by Paul's mention of his previous letter in 1 Corinthians 5:9. The other two being what is called the Second Epistle to the Corinthians and a \"tearful, severe\" letter mentioned in 2 Corinthians 2:3\u20134. The book called the Third Epistle to the Corinthians is generally not believed by scholars to have been written by Paul, as the text claims.\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nThe original manuscript of this book is lost, and the text of surviving manuscripts varies. The oldest manuscripts containing some or all of the text of this book include:\nStructure.\nThe epistle is generally divided into a number of sections. In addition to the opening salutation and thanksgiving, and the closing comments, John Barclay argues for five main parts. Robertson and Plummer divide the letter into two parts: one part (chapters 1-6) deals with issues raised by \"Chloe's people\" (see 1 Corinthians 1:11) and the other part (chapters 7-16) addresses issues raised by a delegation (see 1 Corinthians 7:1). Daniel B. Wallace sets out six main sections:\nContent.\nSome time before 2 Corinthians was written, Paul paid the church at Corinth a second visit to check some rising disorder, and wrote them a letter, now lost. The church had also been visited by Apollos, perhaps by Peter, and by some Jewish Christians who brought with them letters of commendation from Jerusalem.\nPaul wrote 1 Corinthians letter to correct what he saw as erroneous views in the Corinthian church. Several sources informed Paul of conflicts within the church at Corinth: Apollos, a letter from the Corinthians, \"those of Chloe\", and finally Stephanas and his two friends who had visited Paul. Paul then wrote this letter to the Corinthians, urging uniformity of belief (\"that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you\", 1:10) and expounding Christian doctrine. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter to the church at Corinth.\nIn general, divisions within the church at Corinth seem to be a problem, and Paul makes it a point to mention these conflicts in the beginning. Specifically, pagan roots still hold sway within their community. Paul wants to bring them back to what he sees as correct doctrine, stating that God has given him the opportunity to be a \"skilled master builder\" to lay the foundation and let others build upon it.\n1 Corinthians 6:9\u201310 contains a notable condemnation of idolatry, thievery, drunkenness, slandering, swindling, adultery, and other acts the authors consider sexually immoral.\nThe majority of early manuscripts end chapter 6 with the words . The Textus Receptus adds , which the New King James Version translates as \"and in your spirit, which are (i.e. body and spirit) God's\". J. J. Lias, in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, notes that \"these words are not found in many of the best MSS. and versions, and they somewhat weaken the force of the argument, which is intended to assert the dignity of the body. They were perhaps inserted by some who, missing the point of the Apostle's argument, thought that the worship of the spirit was unduly passed over.\"\nLater, Paul wrote about immorality in Corinth by discussing an immoral brother, how to resolve personal disputes, and sexual purity. Regarding marriage, Paul states that it is better for Christians to remain unmarried, but that if they lacked self-control, it is better to marry than \"burn\" (). The epistle may include marriage as an apostolic practice in 1 Corinthians 9:5, \"Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas (Peter)?\" (In the last case, the letter concurs with Matthew 8:14, which mentions Peter having a mother-in-law and thus, by inference, a wife.) However, the Greek word for 'wife' is the same word for 'woman'. The Early Church Fathers, including Tertullian, Jerome, and Augustine state the Greek word is ambiguous and the women in 1 Corinthians 9:5 were women ministering to the Apostles as women ministered to Christ, and were not wives, and assert they left their \"offices of marriage\" to follow Christ. Paul also argues that married people must please their spouses, just as every Christian must please God.\nThroughout the letter, Paul presents issues that are troubling the community in Corinth and offers ways to resolve them. Paul states that this letter serves to \"admonish\" them as beloved children. They are expected to become imitators of Jesus and follow the ways in Christ as he, Paul, teaches in all his churches.\nPaul's closing remarks in his letters usually contain his intentions and efforts to improve the community. He would first conclude with his paraenesis and wish the community peace by including a prayer request, greet them with his name and his friends with a holy kiss, and offer final grace and benediction:\nThis epistle contains some well-known phrases, including: \"all things to all men\",\"through a glass, darkly\", and:\n\"Through a glass, darkly\".\n1 Corinthians 13:12 contains the phrase , which was translated in the 1560 Geneva Bible as \"For now we see through a glass darkly\" (without a comma). This wording was used in the 1611 KJV, which added a comma before \"darkly\". This passage has inspired the titles of many works, with and without the comma.\nThe Greek word (genitive; nominative: ), here translated \"glass\", is ambiguous, possibly referring to a mirror or a lens. Influenced by Strong's Concordance, many modern translations conclude that this word refers specifically to a mirror. Example English language translations include:\nPaul's usage is in keeping with rabbinic use of the term , a borrowing from the Latin . This has the same ambiguous meaning, although Adam Clarke concluded that it was a reference to , clear polished stones used as lenses or windows. One way to preserve this ambiguity is to use the English cognate, \"speculum\". Rabbi Judah ben Ilai (2nd century) was quoted as saying \"All the prophets had a vision of God as He appeared through nine specula\" while \"Moses saw God through one speculum.\" The Babylonian Talmud states similarly \"All the prophets gazed through a speculum that does not shine, while Moses our teacher gazed through a speculum that shines.\"\nWomen must remain silent.\nThe letter is also notable for its discussion of Paul's view of the role of women the church. In , it is stated that women must remain silent in the churches, and yet in it states they have a role of prophecy and apparently speaking tongues in churches. Many scholars believe that verses 14:34\u201335 are an interpolation. The passage interrupts the flow of Paul's argument; it follows language from the First Epistle to Timothy, which was probably not written by Paul; it contradicts Paul's neutral or positive mention of women prophesying, praying, and taking other speaking and leadership roles in the church; the passage is alternatively found at different locations in some manuscripts, which may indicate it was originally inserted as a marginal note and then unstably inserted into the text itself. Moreover, some manuscripts give evidence of a prior record of its absence from the text.\nIf verse 14:34\u201335 is not an interpolation, certain scholars resolve the tension between these texts by positing that wives were either contesting their husband's inspired speeches at church, or the wives/women were chatting and asking questions in a disorderly manner when others were giving inspired utterances. Their silence was unique to the particular situation in the Corinthian gatherings at that time, and on this reading, Paul did not intend his words to be universalized for all women of all churches of all eras.\nOther scholars including Joseph Fitzmyer suggest that in verses 34\u201335, Paul may be quoting the position of some native Corinthian Christians regarding women who have been speaking out in cultic assemblies in order that he can then argue against it. According to Craig Keener, \"When Paul suggests that husbands should teach their wives at home, his point is not to belittle women's ability to learn. To the contrary, Paul is advocating the most progressive view of his day: despite the possibility that she is less educated than himself, the husband should recognize his wife's intellectual capability and therefore make himself responsible for her education...\"\nHead covering.\n1 Corinthians 11:2\u201316 contains an admonishment that Christian women cover their hair while praying and that Christian men leave their heads uncovered while praying. These practices were countercultural; the surrounding pagan Greek women prayed unveiled and Jewish men prayed with their heads covered.\nThe King James Version of 1 Corinthians 11:10 reads \"For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.\" Other versions translate \"power\" as \"authority\". In many early biblical manuscripts (such as certain Vulgate, Coptic, and Armenian manuscripts), is rendered with the word \"veil\" () rather than the word \"authority\" (); the Revised Standard Version reflects this, displaying 1 Corinthians 11:10 as follows: \"That is why a woman ought to have a veil on her head, because of the angels.\" Similarly, a scholarly footnote in the New American Bible notes that presence of the word \"\"authority\" () may possibly be due to mistranslation of an Aramaic word for \"veil\"\". This mistranslation may be due to \"the fact that in Aramaic the roots of the word \"power\" and \"veil\" are spelled the same.\" The last-known living connection to the apostles, Irenaeus, penned verse 10 using the word \"veil\" () instead of \"authority\" () in \"Against Heresies\", as did other Church Fathers in their writings, including Hippolytus, Origen, Chrysostom, Jerome, Epiphanius, Augustine, and Bede.\nScholars are divided on the meaning of the phrase \"because of the angels\" in v. 10. According to Dale Martin, Paul is concerned that angels may look lustfully at beautiful women, as the \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6 apparently did. Noting the similarity between the Greek word translated \"veil\" and the Greek word for a seal or cork of a wine jug, Martin theorizes that the veil acted not only to conceal the beauty of a woman's hair, but also as a symbolic protective barrier that \"sealed\" the woman against the influence of fallen angels. Other scholars, such as Joseph Fitzmyer, believe the angels spoken of here are not fallen angels looking lustfully at women, but good angels who watch over church services. Notably, the author of Hebrews mentions \"entertaining angels\" and evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls suggests some Second Temple era Jews believed angels attended synagogue services. According to this view, Paul's concern is not that an angel looks lustfully, but simply that the appearance of an inappropriately dressed women might offend the heavenly guardians. A third interpretation comes from Bruce Winter, who theorizes that the \"angels\" spoken of are not heavenly beings at all, but simply human visitors. Winter notes that the Greek word translated \"angels\" literally means \"messengers\" and could refer to a visitor carrying a letter from afar, possibly even the epistle itself. In this view, Paul is concerned that if a visitor to a church service sees a married woman with her head uncovered, he may judge that woman to be promiscuous. Thus, Paul seeks to protect the church community's honor by ensuring that all members appear above reproach.\nThe head covering ordinance continued to be handed down after the apostolic era to the next generations of Christians; writing 150 years after Paul, the early Christian apologist Tertullian stated that the women of the church in Corinthboth virgins and marriedpracticed veiling, given that Paul the Apostle delivered the teaching to them: \"the Corinthians themselves understood him in this manner. In fact, at this very day, the Corinthians do veil their virgins. What the apostles taught, their disciples approve.\" From the period of the early Church to the late modern period, 1 Corinthians 11 was universally understood to enjoin the wearing of the headcovering throughout the daya practice that has since waned in Western Europe but has continued in certain parts of the world, such as in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Northern Africa and the Indian subcontinent, as well as everywhere by Conservative Anabaptists (such as the Conservative Mennonite Churches and the Dunkard Brethren Church), who count veiling as being one of the ordinances of the Church. The early Church Father John Chrysostom explicates that 1 Corinthians 11 enjoins the continual wearing the headcovering by referencing Paul the Apostle's view that being shaven is always dishonourable and his pointing to the angels:\n\"Agape\".\nChapter 13 of 1 Corinthians is one of many definitional sources for the original Greek word . In the original Greek, the word is used throughout chapter 13. This is translated into English as \"charity\" in the King James version; but the word \"love\" is preferred by most other translations, both earlier and more recent.\n1 Corinthians 11:17-34 contains a condemnation of what the authors consider inappropriate behavior at Corinthian gatherings that appeared to be agape feasts.\nResurrection.\nAfter discussing his views on worshipping idols, Paul ends the letter with his views on resurrection and the Resurrection of Jesus.\nThe text of First Corinthians has been interpreted as evidence of existing dualistic beliefs among the Corinthians. Scholars point to 1 Cor 6:12:\nBased on interpretations of the text, it appears that Corinthians did not believe that the soul would return to its physical prison after death. Paul is critical of the Corinthian denial of the resurrection of the dead in 15:12 asking: \"Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?\" Richard Horsley has argued that use of contrasting terms like corruption/incorruption in a polemic about resurrection supports a theory that Paul is using the \"language of the Corinthians\" in these verses. Multiple academic theories have been proposed for the source of this language including Greek philosophical influence, Gnosticism and the teachings of Philo of Alexandria.\nMost scholars agree that Paul was reinforcing earlier tradition about resurrection noting that he describes the kerygma as \"received\".\nPaul represents the kerygma to the Corinthians \"as a sacred tradition\" that Christ was \"raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures\". James P. Ware notes that the original Greek word \u1f10\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03c9, translated as \"raised\", always refers to the reanimation of the corpse when used with reference to the dead. He states that \"[i]t is thus beyond doubt that the apostolic formula of 1 Cor 15 affirms that Jesus arose on the third day in his crucified body, leaving behind an empty tomb.\"\nKirk MacGregor notes the textual evidence from the kerygma as stated in 15:3-7 is cited by modern scholars as evidence \"that Jesus' earliest disciples believed in a spiritual resurrection which did not necessarily vacate his tomb\". Dale Moody says the tradition of the appearances of the resurrected Christ and the tradition of the empty tomb \"remain separate in the oldest strata of tradition\".\nGeza Vermes states that the words of Paul are \"a tradition he has inherited from his seniors in the faith concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus\". The kerygma was possibly transmitted from the Jerusalem apostolic community though the core formula may have originated in Damascus.\nIt may be one of the earliest kerygmas about Jesus' death and resurrection, though it is also possible that Paul himself joined the various statements, as proposed by Urich Wilckens. It is also possible that \"he appeared\" was not specified in the core formula, and that the specific appearances are additions. According to Hannack, line 3b-4 form the original core, while line 5 and line 7 contain competing statements from two different factions. Prive also argues that line 5 and line 7 reflect the tensions between Petrus and James.\nThe kerygma has often been dated to no more than five years after Jesus' death by Biblical scholars. Bart Ehrman dissents, saying that \"Among scholars I personally know, except for evangelicals, I don't now[\"sic\"] anyone who thinks this at all.\" Gerd L\u00fcdemann however, maintains that \"the elements in the tradition are to be dated to the first two years after the crucifixion of Jesus[...] not later than three years\".\nAccording to Gary R. Habermas, in \"Corinthians 15:3\u20138, Paul records an ancient oral tradition(s) that summarizes the content of the Christian gospel.\" N.T Wright describes it as \"the very early tradition that was common to all Christians\".\nIn dissent from the majority view, Robert M. Price, Hermann Detering, John V. M. Sturdy, and David Oliver Smith have each argued that 1 Corinthians 15:3\u20137 is a later interpolation. According to Price, the text is not an early Christian creed written within five years of Jesus' death, nor did Paul write these verses. In his assessment, this was an Interpolation possibly dating to the beginning of the 2nd century. Price states that \"The pair of words in verse 3a, \"received / delivered\" (paralambanein / paradidonai) is, as has often been pointed out, technical language for the handing on of rabbinical tradition\", so it would contradict Paul's account of his conversion given in Galatians 1:13\u201324, which explicitly says that Paul had been taught the gospel of Christ by Jesus himself, not by any other man.\nChapter 15 closes with an account of the nature of the resurrection, claiming that in the Last Judgement the dead will be raised and both the living and the dead transformed into \"spiritual bodies\" (verse 44).\nPsalm 8 reference.\n1 Corinthians 15:27 refers to Psalm 8:6. Ephesians 1:22 also refers to this verse of Psalm 8.\nEvil company corrupts good habits.\n1 Corinthians 15:33 contains the aphorism \"evil company corrupts good habits\", from classical Greek literature. According to the church historian Socrates of Constantinople it is taken from a Greek tragedy of Euripides, but modern scholarship, following Jerome, attributes it to the comedy by Menander, or Menander quoting Euripides. Hans Conzelmann remarks that the quotation was widely known. Whatever the proximate source, this quote does appear in one of the fragments of Euripides' works.\nBaptism of the dead.\n1 Corinthians 15:29 argues it would be pointless to baptise the dead if people are not raised from the dead. This verse suggests that there existed a practice at Corinth whereby a living person would be baptized in the stead of some convert who had recently died. Teignmouth Shore, writing in Ellicott's \"Commentary for Modern Readers\", notes that among the \"numerous and ingenious conjectures\" about this passage, the only tenable interpretation is that there existed a practice of baptising a living person to substitute those who had died before that sacrament could have been administered in Corinth, as also existed among the Marcionites in the second century, or still earlier than that, among a sect called \"the Corinthians\". The Jerusalem Bible states that \"What this practice was is unknown. Paul does not say if he approved of it or not: he uses it merely for an \"ad hominem\" argument\".\nThe Latter Day Saint movement interprets this passage to support the practice of baptism for the dead. This principle of vicarious work for the dead is an important work of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This interpretation is rejected by other Christians.\nCommentaries.\nJohn Chrysostom, an early Church Father and archbishop of Constantinople, wrote a commentary on 1 Corinthians, formed by 44 homilies."}

{"id": "11382", "revid": "102477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11382", "title": "File manager", "text": "A file manager or file browser is a computer program that provides a user interface to manage files and folders. The most common operations performed on files or groups of files include creating, opening (e.g. viewing, playing, editing or printing), renaming, copying, moving, deleting and searching for files, as well as modifying file attributes, properties and file permissions. Folders and files may be displayed in a hierarchical tree based on their directory structure.\nFeatures.\nFile transfer.\nGraphical file managers may support copying and moving of files through \"copy and paste\" and \"cut and paste\" respectively, as well as through drag and drop, and a separate menu for selecting the target path.\nWhile transferring files, a file manager may show the source and destination directories, transfer progress in percentage and/or size, progress bar, name of the file currently being transferred, remaining and/or total number of files, numerical transfer rate, and graphical transfer rate. The ability to pause the file transfer allows temporarily granting other software full sequential read access while allowing to resume later without having to restart the file transfer.\nSome file managers move multiple files by copying and deleting each selected file from the source individually, while others first copy all selected files, then delete them from the source afterwards, as described in .\nConflicting file names in a target directory may be handled through renaming, overwriting, or skipping. Renaming is typically numerical. Overwriting may be conditional, such as when the source file is newer or differs in size. Files could technically be compared with checksums, but that would require reading through the entire source and target files, which would slow down the process significantly on larger files.\nUser interface.\nSome file managers contain features analogous to web browsers, including forward and back navigational buttons, an address bar, tabs, and a bookmark side bar.\nNetworking.\nSome file managers provide network connectivity via protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, NFS, SMB or WebDAV. This is achieved by allowing the user to browse for a file server (connecting and accessing the server's file system like a local file system) or by providing its own full client implementations for file server protocols.\nDirectory editors.\nA term that the usage of \"file manager\" is \"directory editor\". An early directory editor, DIRED, was developed circa 1974 at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Stan Kugell.\nA directory editor was written for EXEC 8 at the University of Maryland, and was available to other users at that time. The term was used by other developers, including Jay Lepreau, who wrote the dired program in 1980, which ran on BSD. This was in turn inspired by an older program with the same name running on TOPS-20. Dired inspired other programs, including dired, the editor script (for emacs and similar editors), and ded.\nFile-list file manager.\n\"File-list\" file managers are lesser known and older than orthodox file managers.\nOne such file manager was neptune. It ran on the Xerox Alto in the 1973-1974 time frame.\nIt had some of the same features that would end up in orthodox file managers.\nAnother such file manager is flist, which was introduced sometime before 1980 on the Conversational Monitor System.\nThis is a variant of FULIST, which originated before late 1978, according to comments by its author, Theo Alkema.\nThe flist program provided a list of files in the user's minidisk, and allowed sorting by any file attribute. The file attributes could be passed to scripts or function-key definitions, making it simple to use flist as part of CMS EXEC, EXEC 2 or XEDIT scripts.\nThis program ran only on IBM VM/SP CMS, but was the inspiration for other programs, including filelist (a script run via the Xedit editor), and programs running on other operating systems, including a program also called flist, which ran on OpenVMS, and FULIST (from the name of the corresponding internal IBM program), which runs on Unix.\nOrthodox file managers.\nOrthodox file managers (sometimes abbreviated to \"OFM\") or command-based file managers are text-menu based file managers that commonly have three windows (two panels and one command line window). Orthodox file managers are one of the longest running families of file managers, preceding graphical user interface-based types. Developers create applications that duplicate and extend the manager that was introduced by PathMinder and John Socha's Norton Commander for DOS. The concept dates to the mid-1980s\u2014PathMinder was released in 1984, and Norton Commander version 1.0 was released in 1986. Despite the age of this concept, file managers based on Norton Commander are actively developed, and dozens of implementations exist for DOS, Unix, and Microsoft Windows. Nikolai Bezroukov publishes his own set of criteria for an OFM standard (version 1.2 dated June 1997).\nFeatures.\nAn orthodox file manager typically has three windows. Two of the windows are called panels and are positioned symmetrically at the top of the screen. The third is the command line, which is essentially a minimized command (shell) window that can be expanded to full screen. Only one of the panels is active at a given time. The active panel contains the \"file cursor\". Panels are resizable and can be hidden. Files in the active panel serve as the source of file operations performed by the manager. For example, files can be copied or moved from the active panel to the location represented in the passive panel. This scheme is most effective for systems in which the keyboard is the primary or sole input device. The active panel shows information about the current working directory and the files that it contains. The passive (inactive) panel shows the content of the same or another directory (the default target for file operations). Users may customize the display of columns that show relevant file information. The active panel and passive panel can be switched (often by pressing the tab key).\nThe following features describe the class of orthodox file managers.\nOther common features include:\nTabbed panels.\nThe introduction of tabbed panels in some file managers (for example Total Commander) made it possible to manipulate more than one active and passive directory at a time.\nPortability.\nOrthodox file managers are among the most portable file managers. Examples are available on almost any platform, with both command-line and graphical interfaces. This is unusual among command line managers in that something purporting to be a standard for the interface is published. They are also actively supported by developers. This makes it possible to do the same work on different platforms without much relearning of the interface.\nDual-pane managers.\nSometimes they are called dual-pane managers, a term that is typically used for programs such as the Windows File Explorer (see below). But they have three panes including a command line pane below (or hidden behind) two symmetric panes. Furthermore, most of these programs allow using just one of the two larger panes with the second hidden. Some also add an item to the Context Menu in Windows to \"Open two Explorers, side by side\".\nNotable ones include:\nNavigational file manager.\nA navigational file manager is a newer type of file manager. Since the advent of GUIs, it has become the dominant type of file manager for desktop computers.\nTypically, it has two panes, with the filesystem tree in the left pane and the contents of the current directory in the right pane. For macOS, the Miller columns view in Finder (originating in NeXTStep) is a variation on the navigational file manager theme.\nConcepts.\nThe interface in a navigational file manager often resembles a web browser, complete with \"back\" and \"forward\" buttons, and often \"reload\" buttons. Most also contain an address bar into which the file or directory path (or URI) can be typed.\nMost navigational file managers have two panes, the left pane being a tree view of the filesystem. This means that unlike orthodox file managers, the two panes are asymmetrical in their content and use.\nSelecting a directory in the Navigation pane on the left designates it as the current directory, displaying its contents in the Contents pane on the right. However, expanding (+) or collapsing (-) a portion of the tree without selecting a directory will not alter the contents of the right pane. The exception to this behavior applies when collapsing a parent of the current directory, in which case the selection is refocused on the collapsed parent directory, thus altering the list in the Contents pane.\nThe process of moving from one location to another need not open a new window. Several instances of the file manager can be opened simultaneously and communicate with each other via drag-and-drop and clipboard operations, so it is possible to view several directories simultaneously and perform cut-and paste operations between instances.\nFile operations are based on drag-and-drop and editor metaphors: users can select and copy files or directories onto the clipboard and then paste them in a different place in the filesystem or even in a different instance of the file manager.\nNotable examples of navigational file managers include:\nSpatial file manager.\nSpatial file managers use a spatial metaphor to represent files and directories as if they were actual physical objects. A spatial file manager imitates the way people interact with physical objects.\nSome ideas behind the concept of a spatial file manager are:\nAs in navigational file managers, when a directory is opened, the icon representing the directory changes\u2014perhaps from an image showing a closed drawer to an opened one, perhaps the directory's icon turns into a silhouette filled with a pattern\u2014and a new window is opened to represent that directory.\nExamples of file managers that use a spatial metaphor to some extent include:\nDysfunctional spatial file managers:\n3D file managers.\nSome projects have attempted to implement a three-dimensional method of displaying files and directory structures. Three-dimensional file browsing has not become popular; the exact implementation tends to differ between projects, and there are no common standards to follow.\nExamples of three-dimensional file managers include:\nWeb-based file managers.\nWeb-based file managers are typically scripts written in either PHP, Ajax, Perl, ASP or another server-side language. When installed on a local server or on a remote server, they allow files and directories located there to be managed and edited, using a web browser, without the need for FTP Access.\nMore advanced, and usually commercially distributed, web-based file management scripts allow the administrator of the file manager to configure secure, individual user accounts, each with individual account permissions. Authorized users have access to documents stored on the server or in their individual user directories anytime, from anywhere, via a web browser.\nA web-based file manager can serve as an organization's digital repository. For example, documents, digital media, publishing layouts, and presentations can be stored, managed, and shared between customers, suppliers, and remote workers, or just internally.\nWeb-based file managers are becoming increasingly popular due to the rise in popularity of dynamic web content management systems (CMS) and the need for non-technical website moderators to manage media on their websites powered by these platforms.\nAn example is net2ftp, a PHP- and JavaScript-based FTP client.\nFile picker.\nOperating systems typically ship a \"file picker\", which allows specifying in which location to save a file (usually accessed through the \"Save as\" option in software), and where to open a file from. Sometimes, a folder is selected instead of a file or destination path.\nSome file pickers also allow file management to some degree, such as searching, moving, copying, renaming, and copying the path to clipboard.\nSome software might have a customized file picker."}

The file viewer is responsible for user access of files located on a data storage device. File viewers allow the user to open and view content on a device, such as a Personal Computer (PC) or a mobile phone.\nOverview.\nFile viewer applications can be categorized based on their functionality:\nDifferences in functionality are often due to software licensing and proprietary file formats. Some formats can be freely viewed but require specific software for creation or modification. For example, .DBF files created in dBASE could be viewed in Norton Commander, while .PDF files require software like Adobe Photoshop, LibreOffice, or Microsoft Word for editing, whereas Acrobat Reader supports only viewing.\nTo function correctly, a file viewer must interpret the structural information of a file format, such as byte order, character encoding, and newline styles. Media file viewers, such as video players, often rely on codecs rather than built-in format support. This approach allows users to extend a media viewer\u2019s compatibility with additional file types.\nSome editors, such as Audacity, allow users to open files as raw data, a feature sometimes used in glitch art. Additionally, some file viewers act as filters that convert binary files into text (e.g., antiword), though this may result in data loss.\nImage viewers display graphic files on screen. Some viewers, such as IrfanView, can read multiple graphic file formats, while others, such as JPEGview only support a single format. Common image viewer features include thumbnail preview and creation, image zooming and rotation, color balance and gamma correction, resizing, etc.\nA web browser functions as a file viewer for HTML and various other file types. While HTML files are stored as plain text, web browsers render them into a structured, human-readable format. Additionally, web browsers can display multimedia files, including images, videos, preformatted documents, and interactive content such as 3D models, augmented reality and virtual reality elements."}

{"id": "11387", "revid": "1666642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11387", "title": "First Epistle of Peter", "text": "The First Epistle of Peter is a book of the New Testament. The author presents himself as Peter the Apostle. The ending of the letter includes a statement that implies that it was written from \"Babylon\", which may be a reference to Rome. The letter is addressed to the \"chosen pilgrims of the diaspora\" in Asia Minor suffering religious persecution.\nAuthorship.\nThe authorship of 1 Peter has traditionally been attributed to the Apostle Peter because it bears his name and identifies him as its author (1:1). Although the text identifies Peter as its author, the language, dating, style, and structure of this letter have led most scholars to conclude that it is pseudonymous. Many scholars argue that Peter was not the author of the letter because its writer appears to have had a formal education in rhetoric and philosophy, and an advanced knowledge of the Greek language, none of which would be usual for a Galilean fisherman.\nNew Testament scholar Graham Stanton rejects Petrine authorship because 1 Peter was most likely written during the reign of Domitian in AD 81, which is when he believes widespread Christian persecution began, which is long after the death of Peter. More recent scholars such as Travis Williams say that the persecution described does not appear to be describing official Roman persecutions after Peter's death, thus not directly ruling out an early date for the composition of the epistle. \nAnother dating issue is the reference to \"Babylon\" in chapter 5 verse 13, generally agreed to be a claim the letter was written from Rome. It is believed that the identification of Rome with Babylon, the ancient enemy of the Jews, only came after the destruction of the Temple in AD 70. Other scholars doubt Petrine authorship because they are convinced that 1 Peter is dependent on the Pauline epistles and thus was written after Paul the Apostle's ministry because it shares many of the same motifs espoused in Ephesians, Colossians, and the Pastoral Epistles. \nOthers argue that it makes little sense to ascribe the work to Peter when it could have been ascribed to Paul. Alternatively, one theory supporting legitimate Petrine authorship of 1 Peter is the \"secretarial hypothesis\", which suggests that 1 Peter was dictated by Peter and was written in Greek by his secretary, Silvanus (5:12). John Elliot disagrees, suggesting that the notion of Silvanus as secretary or author or drafter of 1 Peter introduces more problems than it solves, and claims that the Greek rendition of 5:12 suggests that Silvanus was not the secretary, but the courier/bearer of 1 Peter. Like English translations generally, the more recent NRSV (2021) translation of this verse from the Greek does not exclude understanding Silvanus as secretary: \"Through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother, I have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.\" Some see Mark as a contributive amanuensis in the composition and writing of the work. \nOn the one hand, some scholars such as Bart D. Ehrman are convinced that the language, dating, literary style, and structure of this text makes it implausible to conclude that 1 Peter was written by Peter. According to these scholars, it is more likely that 1 Peter is a pseudonymous letter, written later by an unknown Christian in his name. \nOn the other hand, some scholars argue that there is enough evidence to conclude that Peter did, in fact, write 1 Peter. For instance, there are similarities between 1 Peter and Peter's speeches in the Biblical book of Acts, allusions to several historical sayings of Jesus indicative of eyewitness testimony (e.g., compare Luke 12:35 with 1 Peter 1:13, Matthew 5:16 with 1 Peter 2:12, and Matthew 5:10 with 1 Peter 3:14), and early attestation of Peter's authorship found in 2 Peter (AD 60\u2013160) and the letters of Clement (AD 70\u2013140), all supporting genuine Petrine origin. Ultimately, the authorship of 1 Peter remains contested.\nOldest surviving manuscripts.\nThe original manuscript of this letter is lost, as are several centuries of copies. The text of the surviving manuscripts varies. The oldest surviving manuscripts that contain some or all of this book include:\nAudience.\n1 Peter is addressed to the \"elect resident aliens\" scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. The five areas listed in 1:1 as the geographical location of the first readers were Roman provinces in Asia Minor. The order in which the provinces are listed may reflect the route to be taken by the messenger who delivered the circular letter. The recipients of this letter are referred to in 1:1 as \"exiles of the Dispersion\". In 1:17, they are urged to \"live in reverent fear during the time of your exile\". The social makeup of the addressees of 1 Peter is debatable because some scholars interpret \"strangers\" (1:1) as Christians longing for their home in heaven, some interpret it as literal \"strangers\", or as an Old Testament adaptation applied to Christian believers.\nWhile the new Christians have encountered oppression and hostility from locals, Peter advises them to maintain loyalty both to their religion and the Roman Empire (1 Peter 2:17).\nThe author counsels (1) to steadfastness and perseverance under persecution (1\u20132:10); (2) to the practical duties of a holy life (2:11\u20133:13); (3) he adduces the example of Christ and other motives to patience and holiness (3:14\u20134:19); and (4) concludes with counsels to pastors and people (chap. 5).\nOutline.\nDavid Bartlett uses the following outline to structure the literary divisions of 1 Peter:\nContext.\nThe Petrine author writes of his addressees undergoing \"various trials\" (1 Peter 1:6), being \"tested by fire\" (which is not a physical reference but a metaphor for spiritual warfare; 1:7), maligned \"as evildoers\" (2:12) and suffering \"for doing good\" (3:17). Based on such internal evidence, biblical scholar John Elliott summarizes the addressees' situation as one marked by undeserved suffering. Verse , \"Spirits in prison\", is a continuing theme in Christianity, and one considered by most theologians to be enigmatic and difficult to interpret.\nA number of verses in the epistle contain possible clues about the reasons Christians experienced opposition. Exhortations to live blameless lives (2:15; 3:9, 13, 16) may suggest that the Christian addressees were accused of immoral behavior, and exhortations to civil obedience (2:13\u201317) perhaps imply that they were accused of disloyalty to governing powers.\nHowever, scholars differ on the nature of persecution inflicted on the addressees of 1 Peter. Some read the epistle to be describing persecution in the form of social discrimination, while some read them to be official persecution.\nSocial discrimination of Christians.\nSome scholars believe that the sufferings the epistle's addressees were experiencing were social in nature, specifically in the form of verbal derision. Internal evidence for this includes the use of words like \"malign\" (2:12; 3:16), and \"reviled\" (4:14). Biblical scholar John Elliott notes that the author explicitly urges the addressees to respect authority (2:13) and even honor the emperor (2:17), strongly suggesting that they were unlikely to be suffering from official Roman persecution. It is significant to him that the author notes that \"your brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering\" (5:9), indicating suffering that is worldwide in scope. Elliott sees this as grounds to reject the idea that the epistle refers to official persecution, because the first worldwide persecution of Christians officially meted by Rome did not occur until the persecution initiated by Decius in AD 250.\nOfficial persecution of Christians.\nOn the other hand, scholars who support the official persecution theory take the exhortation to defend one's faith (3:15) as a reference to official court proceedings. They believe that these persecutions involved court trials before Roman authorities, and even executions.\nOne common supposition is that 1 Peter was written during the reign of Domitian (AD 81\u201396). Domitian's aggressive claim to divinity would have been rejected and resisted by Christians. Biblical scholar Paul Achtemeier believes that persecution of Christians by Domitian would have been in character, but points out that there is no evidence of official policy targeted specifically at Christians. If Christians were persecuted, it is likely to have been part of Domitian's larger policy suppressing all opposition to his self-proclaimed divinity. There are other scholars who explicitly dispute the idea of contextualizing 1 Peter within Domitian's reign. Duane Warden believes that Domitian's unpopularity even among Romans renders it highly unlikely that his actions would have great influence in the provinces, especially those under the direct supervision of the senate such as Asia (one of the provinces 1 Peter is addressed to).\nAlso often advanced as a possible context for 1 Peter is the trials and executions of Christians in the Roman province of Bithynia-Pontus under Pliny the Younger. Scholars who support this theory believe that a famous letter from Pliny to Emperor Trajan concerning the delation of Christians reflects the situation faced by the addressees of this epistle. In Pliny's letter, written in AD 112, he asks Trajan if the accused Christians brought before him should be punished based on the name 'Christian' alone, or for crimes associated with the name. For biblical scholar John Knox, the use of the word \"name\" in 4:14\u201316 is the \"crucial point of contact\" with that in Pliny's letter. In addition, many scholars in support of this theory believe that there is content within 1 Peter that directly mirrors the situation as portrayed in Pliny's letter. For instance, they interpret the exhortation to defend one's faith \"with gentleness and reverence\" in 3:15\u201316 as a response to Pliny executing Christians for the obstinate manner in which they professed to be Christians. Generally, this theory is rejected mainly by scholars who read the suffering in 1 Peter to be caused by social, rather than official, discrimination.\nThe Harrowing of Hell.\nThe author refers to Jesus, after his death, proclaiming to spirits in prison (3:18\u201320). This passage, and a few others (such as Matthew 27:52 and Luke 23:43), are the basis of the traditional Christian belief in the descent of Christ into hell, or the harrowing of hell. Though interpretations vary, some theologians see this passage as referring to Jesus, after his death, going to a place (neither heaven nor hell in the ultimate sense) where the souls of pre-Christian people waited for the Gospel. The first creeds to mention the harrowing of hell were Arian formularies of Sirmium (359), Nike (360), and Constantinople (360). It spread through the west and later appeared in the Apostles' Creed.\nSubmissiveness of women.\n1 Peter 3:1 instructs women to submit to their husbands, \"so that, even if some of them do not obey the Word, they may be won over without a word by their wives' conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.\""}
{"id": "11388", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11388", "title": "First Epistle of John", "text": "The First Epistle of John is the first of the Johannine epistles of the New Testament, and the fourth of the catholic epistles. There is no scholarly consensus as to the authorship of the Johannine works. The author of the First Epistle is termed John the Evangelist, who most modern scholars believe is not the same as John the Apostle. Most scholars believe the three Johannine epistles have the same author, but there is no consensus if this was also the author of the Gospel of John.\nThis epistle was probably written in Ephesus between 95 and 110 AD. The author advises Christians on how to discern true teachers: by their ethics, their proclamation of Jesus in the flesh, and by their love. The original text was written in Koine Greek. The epistle is divided into five chapters.\nContent.\nThe main themes of the epistle are love and fellowship with God. The author describes various tests by which readers may ascertain whether or not their communion with God is genuine, and teaches that the proof of spiritual regeneration is a life of active righteousness. It also distinguishes between the world (which is full of evil and under the dominion of Satan) and the children of God (who are set apart from the world).\nStyle.\nThe epistle is not written in the same form as the other biblical epistles, as it lacks an epistolary opening or conclusion. The epistle is written in a simple style, without syntactical flourishes, and makes frequent use of asyndeton, where related thoughts are placed next to one another without conjunctions. In contrast to the linear style used in the Pauline epistles, biblical scholar Ernest DeWitt Burton suggests that John's thought \"moves in circles\", forming a slowly advancing sequence of thought. This is similar to the parallel structure of Hebrew poetry, in which the second verse of a couplet often carries the same meaning as the first, although in this epistle the frequent recapitulations of already expressed ideas serve also to add to what has previously been said. In summary, the epistle may be said to exhibit a paraenetic style which is \"marked by personal appeal, contrasts of right and wrong, true and false, and an occasional rhetorical question\".\nThe text refers to the writer's audience several times as \"little children\" (, \"\"). This affectionate diminutive appears seven times in the letter, once as \"my little children\" (1 John 2:1), and the phrase also appears in John 13:33. Paul also uses the phrase \"my little children\" when addressing the Galatian churches in Galatians 4:19.\nSome scholars have proposed the idea that the epistle is really John's commentary on a selection of traditional parallel couplets. While this theory, first propounded by Ernst von Dobsch\u00fctz and Rudolf Bultmann, is not universally accepted, Amos Wilder writes that, \"It is at least clear that there are considerable and sometimes continuous elements in the epistle whose style distinguishes them from that of the author both with respect to poetic structure and syntactic usage.\"\nAuthorship.\nThe epistle is traditionally held to have been composed by John the Evangelist, at Ephesus, when the writer was in advanced age. The epistle's content, language and conceptual style are very similar to the Gospel of John, 2 John, and 3 John. Thus, at the end of the 19th century scholar Ernest DeWitt Burton wrote that there could be \"no reasonable doubt\" that 1 John and the gospel were written by the same author.\nBeginning in the 20th century, however, critical scholars like Heinrich Julius Holtzmann and C. H. Dodd identified the Gospel of John and 1 John as works of different authors. Certain linguistic features of the two texts support this view. For instance, 1 John often uses a demonstrative pronoun at the beginning of a sentence, then a particle or conjunction, followed by an explanation or definition of the demonstrative at the end of the sentence\u2014a stylistic technique which is not used in the gospel. The author of the epistle also \"uses the conditional sentence in a variety of rhetorical figures which are unknown to the gospel\". This indicates, at the very least, the linguistic characteristics changed over time. Today, following the work of J. Louis Martyn and Raymond Brown, the majority of scholars believe that John and 1 John were written by different members of the same community: the \"Johannine Community\".\nMost critical scholars conclude that John the Apostle wrote none of these works.\nPurpose.\n\"The Fourth Gospel addresses itself to the challenges posed by Judaism and others outside Johannine circles who have rejected the community's vision of Jesus as preexistent Son, sent by the Father.\" The New Jerome Biblical Commentary suggests that the three Johannine epistles \"describe the fracturing of the Johannine community itself\".\nThe author wrote the epistle so that the joy of his audience would \"be full\" (1:4); that they would \"not practice sin\" (2:1); that they would not be deceived by false teachers (2:26); and that \"you who believe in the name of the Son of God... may continue to know that you have eternal life\" (5:13). There are two main approaches to understanding the overall purpose of the letter, tests of life (popularized by Robert Law) and tests of fellowship (popularized by John Mitchell and Zane Hodges). Whereas the Gospel of John was written for unbelievers (), this epistle was written to those who were already believers (5:13). Ernest DeWitt Burton found it likely that its audience was largely gentile rather than Jewish, since it contains few Old Testament quotations or distinctly Jewish forms of expression.\nThe epistle also partakes of the debate over Jesus's nature: the debate over \"flesh\" or the incarnation. In early Christianity, some advocated for docetism, a view that Christ had been a purely divine being. Most notably, the group that would eventually become the Gnostics were docetic. 1 John fiercely denounces this belief in favor of the view that Jesus had a real appearance \"in the flesh\" on Earth. Chapter 4 writes that \"every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God\" (NRSV), and other passages say that Jesus shed blood, and if he could not shed blood then his death was meaningless. Chapter 2 also includes a passage that refers to a group of proto-Gnostics: a group that was once with the church but have since left it and deny that the human Jesus was also the spiritual Christ. The author denounces these secessionists as \"antichrists\". The introduction possibly also addresses the issue, especially if the identification of the author as John, or a pseudepigraphic claim to have been a disciple, is assumed: Chapter 1 writes of having evidence of the truth via eyes and touch. The author may thus be claiming to have known the physical Jesus personally and is emphasizing his physicality as a flesh-and-blood person rather than a spirit or phantasm.\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nThe earliest written versions of the epistle have been lost; some of the earliest surviving manuscripts include:\nThe Muratorian fragment, dated to AD 170, cites chapter 1, verses 1\u20133 within a discussion of the Gospel of John. Papyrus 9, dating from the 3rd century, has surviving parts of chapter 4, verses 11\u201312 and 14\u201317.\nDifferent versions of the Greek manuscript have different wording for some verses.\nPrologue.\nVerses 1-4 of the first chapter constitute a prologue or introduction concerning the Incarnate Word. Like the Prologue to John's Gospel, this introduction tells us that what the author proposes to write about is the Word which is the Life. Anglican commentator Alfred Plummer notes that \"the similarity to the of the Gospel is manifest\", but with a significant difference, in that the gospel refers to the existence of the , \"l\u00f3gos\", word, before the creation, whereas here the point is that the word existed before the incarnation.\nJohannine Comma.\nA Trinitarian gloss (marginal note) known as the Johannine Comma, added to Latin translations of the epistle in the 4th century, was interpolated (added to the main text) within 1 John 5:7-8 over the course of the Middle Ages. Although no Greek manuscripts before the 15th century include the passage, Erasmus added it to later editions of his edition of the New Testament, beginning in 1522. Bibles translated from his edition integrate the passage, including the King James Version (1611), which renders it as follows (\"in italics\"):\nTranslations made since the 18th century and based on a critical edition do not include this text, or include it as a footnote. Because the addition supports the doctrine of trinitarianism, it featured in Protestant and Catholic debates on this subject in the early modern period.\nFinal verse.\nPlummer suggests that here, \"as at the end of [John's] Gospel and the Second Epistle, 'Amen' is the addition of a copyist\". The Textus Receptus version includes \"\u1f08\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\", \"Amen\", at the end but critical editions do not.\n\"To the Parthians\".\nAround 415, Augustine of Hippo wrote a commentary in Latin \"On the Epistle of John to the Parthians\" (in Latin, \"ad Parthos\"), in which he identifies the addressees of John's letter as Parthians. It has occasionally been suggested that this refers to a community of converts in the Jewish community of Babylonia. Around 730, Bede wrote that Athanasius of Alexandria had also believed in a Parthian destination for \"1 John\". This tradition, however, is known only from Latin sources. (Three late Greek manuscripts of \"2 John\" label it \"to the Parthians\".) On balance, it is likely that John's first letter was written for the Ephesian church and that the Parthian label results from a misreading or misunderstanding.\nUses.\nMusic.\n\"1 John 4:16\" is a song title in the album \"The Life of the World to Come\", inspired by this verse, which was released by the American band The Mountain Goats in 2009."}
{"id": "11390", "revid": "34493064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11390", "title": "First Vatican Council", "text": "The First Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, commonly known as the First Vatican Council or Vatican I, was the 20th ecumenical council of the Catholic Church, held three centuries after the preceding Council of Trent which was adjourned in 1563. The council was convoked by Pope Pius IX on 29 June 1868, under the rising threat of the Kingdom of Italy encroaching on the Papal States. It opened on 8 December 1869 and was adjourned on 20 September 1870 after the Italian Capture of Rome. Its best-known decision is its definition of papal infallibility.\nThe council's main purpose was to clarify Catholic doctrine in response to the rising influence of the modern philosophical trends of the 19th century. In the Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith (), the council condemned what it considered the errors of rationalism, anarchism, communism, socialism, liberalism, materialism, modernism, naturalism, pantheism, and secularism.\nIts other concern was the doctrine of the primacy (supremacy) and infallibility of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), which it defined in the First Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of Christ ().\nBackground.\nAs early as late 1864, Pope Pius IX had commissioned the cardinals resident in Rome to tender him their opinions as to the advisability of a council. The majority pronounced in favour of the scheme, dissenting voices being rare. After March 1865, the convocation of the council was no longer in doubt. Special bulls were reportedly issued with invitations to Eastern Orthodox and Protestant clerics as well as to other non-Catholics, but apparently none accepted the invitations.\nThe council was summoned by the pope by a bull on 29 June 1868. The first session was held in St. Peter's Basilica on 8 December 1869. Preliminary sessions dealt with general administrative matters and committee assignments. Bishop Bernard John McQuaid complained of rainy weather, inadequate heating facilities, and boredom. Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley of Newark, New Jersey, noted the high prices in Rome. When Lord Houghton asked Cardinal Manning what had been going on, he answered: \"Well, we meet, and we look at one another, and then we talk a little, but when we want to know what we have been doing, we read \"The Times\".\"\nUnlike the five earlier general councils held in Rome, which met in the Lateran Basilica and are known as Lateran councils, it met in Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, hence its name.\nPapal infallibility.\nThe object of the council was a mystery for a while. The first revelation was given in February 1869 by an article in , a Jesuit periodical. It claimed, as the view of many Catholics in France, that the council would be of very brief duration, since the majority of its members were in agreement, and mentioned the proclamation of papal infallibility. Factions around the proposal arose across Europe, and some Italians even proposed setting up a rival council in Naples. However, before the council met all became quiet in view of the studied vagueness of the invitation.\nPope Pius defined as dogma the Immaculate Conception of Mary, the mother of Jesus, in 1854. However, the proposal to define papal infallibility itself as dogma met with resistance, not because of doubts about the substance of the proposed definition, but because some considered it inopportune to take that step at that time. Richard McBrien divides the bishops attending Vatican I into three groups. The first group, which McBrien calls the \"active infallibilists\", was led by Henry Edward Manning and Ignatius von Senestrey. According to McBrien, the majority of the bishops were not so much interested in a formal definition of papal infallibility as they were in strengthening papal authority and, because of this, were willing to accept the agenda of the fallibilists. A minority, some 10% of the bishops, McBrien says, opposed the proposed definition of papal infallibility on both ecclesiastical and pragmatic grounds, because, in their opinion, it departed from the ecclesiastical structure of the early Christian church. From a pragmatic perspective, they feared that defining papal infallibility would alienate some Catholics, create new difficulties for union with non-Catholics, and provoke interference by governments in ecclesiastical affairs. Those who held this view included most of the German and Austro-Hungarian bishops, nearly half of the Americans, one third of the French, most of the Chaldaeans and Melkites, and a few Armenians. Only a few bishops appear to have had doubts about the dogma itself.\nOn 24 April 1870, the dogmatic constitution on the Catholic faith was adopted unanimously. The draft presented to the council on 8 March drew no serious criticism, but a group of 35 English-speaking bishops, who feared that the opening phrase of the first chapter, \" ('Holy Roman Catholic Church'), might be construed as favouring the Anglican branch theory, later succeeded in having an additional adjective inserted, so that the final text read: \" ('Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church'). The constitution thus set forth the teaching of the \"Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church\" on God, revelation and faith.\nThere was stronger opposition to the draft constitution on the nature of the church, which at first did not include the question of papal infallibility, but the majority party in the council, whose position on this matter was much stronger, brought it forward. It was decided to postpone discussion of everything in the draft except infallibility. The decree did not go forward without controversy; Cardinal , Archbishop of Bologna, proposed adding that the pope is assisted by \"the counsel of the bishops manifesting the tradition of the churches\". Pius IX rejected Guidi's view of the bishops as witnesses to the tradition, maintaining: \"I am the tradition.\"\nOn 13 July 1870, a preliminary vote on the section on infallibility was held in a general congregation: 451 voted simply in favour (), 88 against (), and 62 in favour but on condition of some amendment (). This made evident what the outcome would be, and some 60 members of the opposition left Rome so as not to be associated with approval of the document. The final vote, with a choice only between and , was taken on 18 July 1870, with 533 votes in favour and only 2 against defining as a dogma the infallibility of the pope when speaking . The two votes in opposition were cast by Bishops Aloisio Riccio and Edward Fitzgerald.\nThe dogmatic constitution states, in chapter 4:9, that the pope has \"full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole Church\" (chapter 3:9); and that, when he:\nNone of the bishops who had argued that proclaiming the definition was inopportune refused to accept it. Some Catholics, mainly of German language and largely inspired by the historian Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger, formed the separate Old Catholic Church in protest; von D\u00f6llinger did not formally join the new group himself.\nSuspension and aftermath.\nDiscussion of the rest of the document on the nature of the church was to continue when the bishops returned after a summer break. In the meanwhile, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. With the swift German advance and the capture of Emperor Napoleon III, French troops protecting papal rule in Rome withdrew from the city.\nOn 20 October 1870, one month after the newly founded Kingdom of Italy had occupied Rome, Pope Pius IX, who then considered himself a prisoner in the Vatican, issued the bull , adjourning the council indefinitely. While some proposed to continue the council in the Belgian city of Mechlin, it was never reconvened. The council was formally closed in 1960 by Pope John XXIII, prior to the formation of the Second Vatican Council.\nIn reaction to the political implications of the doctrine of infallibility on the sovereignty of secular states, some of the European kingdoms and republics took rapid action against the Catholic Church. The Austrian Empire annulled the Concordat of 1855. In the Kingdom of Prussia, the anti-Catholic \"Kulturkampf\" broke out immediately afterwards, and in the French Third Republic the synod so accentuated the power of ultramontanism (an emphasis on the powers of the pope), that Republican France took steps to curb it by revoking the Concordat of 1801, and therefore completely separating the Church from the state.\nControversies and opposition.\nThe dogma of papal infallibility raised considerable opposition in some liberal theological circles in the Netherlands, Austria, Germany and Switzerland; the most notable theologian opposing the formulation of the dogma was Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger, who was excommunicated in 1871 by Archbishop Gregor von Scherr of Munich and Freising, for refusing to accept the council's decision.\nOld Catholic schism.\nFollowing the council's decision, a minority of clergy and laity opposed to the newly proclaimed dogma united with the Jansenists, which had maintained a somewhat precarious existence in separation from Rome since the 18th century but had preserved an episcopal succession recognized by Rome as valid though illicit. The first consecration of the new order was that of Joseph H. Reinkens, who was made bishop in Germany by a sympathetic Jansenist bishop Johannes Heykamp of Utrecht. Such new group referred to itself as the Old Catholic Church (or the Christian Catholic Church in Switzerland). Old Catholics in Europe united into the Union of Utrecht in 1889, which entered into full communion with the Anglican Communion in 1931 through the Bonn Agreement.\nThe Union of Utrecht still exists to this day and includes the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands, the Catholic Diocese of the Old Catholics in Germany, the Old Catholic Church of Austria, the Old Catholic Church of the Czech Republic, the Polish-Catholic Church of the Republic of Poland and the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland. The Union of Scranton, formed by more theologically conservative Old Catholics, was formed in 2008 and currently includes the Polish National Catholic Church and the Nordic Catholic Church."}
{"id": "11391", "revid": "34493064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11391", "title": "First Council of the Lateran", "text": "The First Council of the Lateran was the 9th ecumenical council recognised by the Catholic Church. The first ecumenical council to be held in Western Europe &amp; the first since the Great Schism of 1054, it was convoked by Pope Callixtus II in December 1122, immediately after the Concordat of Worms. The council sought to bring an end to the practice of the conferring of ecclesiastical benefices by people who were laymen, free the election of bishops and abbots from secular influence, clarify the separation of spiritual and temporal affairs, re-establish the principle that spiritual authority resides solely in the Church and abolish the claim of the Holy Roman Emperor to influence papal elections.\nThe council was significant in size: 300 bishops and more than 600 abbots assembled at Rome's Lateran Palace in March 1123, and Callixtus II presided in person. During the council, the decisions of the Concordat of Worms were read and ratified. Various other decisions were promulgated.\nBackground.\nThe First Lateran Council was called by Pope Callixtus II whose reign began on 1 February 1119. It demarcated the end of the Investiture Controversy, which had begun before the time of Pope Gregory VII. The issues had been contentious and had continued with unabated bitterness for almost a century. Guido, as he had been called before his elevation to the papacy, was the son of William I, Count of Burgundy. He was closely connected with nearly all the royal houses of Europe on both sides of his family. He had been named the papal legate to France by Pope Paschal II. During Guido's tenure in this office, Paschal II yielded to the military threats of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, and was induced to issue the Privilegium in 1111. By that document, the Church gave up much of what had been claimed and subsequently attained by Pope Gregory VII and his Gregorian Reforms.\nThe concessions did not bring the expected peace but were received with violent reactionary opposition everywhere. Europe had come to expect an end to the Investiture Controversy and was not willing to return to the old days, when the Holy Roman Emperor named the pope. The greatest resistance was seen in France and was led by Guido, who still held the office of the papal legate. He had been present in the Lateran Synod of 1112 which had proclaimed the Privilegium of 1111. On his return to France, Guido convoked an assembly of the French and Burgundian bishops at Vienne (1112). There, the lay investiture of the clergy (the practice of the king, especially the Holy Roman Emperor, of naming bishops and the Pope) was denounced as heretical. A sentence of excommunication was pronounced against Henry V, who had extorted through violence from the Pope the concessions documented in the \"Privilegium\". The agreement was deemed to be opposed to the interests of the Church. The decrees from the assembly of Vienne which denounced the Privilegium were sent to Paschal II with a request for confirmation. Pope Paschal II confirmed them, which were received in general terms, on 20 October 1112.\nGuido was later created cardinal by Pope Paschal II. The latter did not seem to have been pleased with Guido's bold and forward attacks upon Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. On the death of Paschal II, 21 January 1118, Gelasius II was elected pope. He was immediately seized by the Italian allies of Henry V and on his liberation by the populace, he fled to Gaeta, where he was crowned. Henry V demanded the confirmation of the \"Privilegium\" and received no satisfactory reply. He then set about naming Burdinus, the archbishop of Braga, as his own pope, who assumed the name Gregory VIII but came to be known as Antipope Gregory VIII. Burdinus had already been deposed and excommunicated because he had crowned Henry V as the Holy Roman Emperor in Rome in 1117.\nThe excommunication of Burdinus was reiterated in Canon 6 of the document produced by Lateran I. Gelasius II promptly excommunicated the antipope Gregory VIII and Henry V. Gelasius was forced to flee under duress from the army of Henry V and took refuge in the monastery of Cluny, where he died in January 1119. On the fourth day after the death of Gelasius II, 1 February 1119, mainly by the exertions of Cardinal Cuno, Guido was elected pope and assumed the title of Callixtus II. He was crowned Pope at Vienne on 9 February 1119.\nBecause of his close connection with the great royal families of Germany, France, England and Denmark, Callixtus II's papacy was received with much anticipation and celebration throughout Europe. There was a real hope throughout the Continent that the Investiture Controversy might be settled once and for all. In the interest of conciliation, even the papal embassy was received by Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, at Strasburg. However, it soon became clear that Henry was not willing to concede his presumed and ancient right to name the pope and the bishops within his kingdom. Perhaps to demonstrate conciliation or because of political necessity, Henry withdrew his support for Antipope Gregory VIII.\nIt was agreed that Henry and Pope Callixtus II would meet at Mousson. On 8 June 1119, Callixtus II held a synod at Toulouse to proclaim the disciplinary reforms he had worked to attain in the French Church. In October, 1119, he opened the council at Reims. Louis VI of France and most of the barons of France attended this council, along with more than 400 bishops and abbots. The Pope was also to meet with Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor at Mousson. However, Henry showed up with an army of 30,000 men. Callixtus II left Reims for Mousson, but upon learning of the warlike stance of Henry quickly retreated to Reims. There, the Church dealt with issues of simony and concubinage of the clergy.\nIt was clear by now that Henry was in no mood to reconcile, and a compromise with him was not to be had. The conclave at Reims considered the situation and determined, as an entire Church, to formally excommunicate both Henry V and the antipope Gregory VIII. This occurred on October 30, 1119. While at Reims, Callixtus II tried to effect a settlement with Henry I of England and his brother Robert, which also met with failure.\nCallixtus II was determined to enter Rome, which was occupied by the German forces and Antipope Gregory VIII. There was an uprising by the population, which forced Gregory to flee the city. After much political and military intrigue in Rome and the southern Italian states, Gregory was formally deposed and Callixtus II was generally recognised as the legitimate Pope in 1121. Having become the established power in Italy, Callixtus II now returned the conflict with Henry V over the issue of lay investiture. Henry had been the recipient of great pressure from many of his barons in Germany over his conflict with the pope. Some had entered into open rebellion. Henry was forced by circumstances to seek a peace with Callixtus. Initial negotiations were conducted in October 1121 at W\u00fcrzburg. Lambert, the Cardinal of Ostia, was dispatched to convoke a synod at Worms, which began on 8 September 1122. By 23 September, the Concordat of Worms, also called the Pactum Calixtinum, was concluded. On his side, the emperor gave up his claim to investiture with ring and crosier and granted the freedom of election to the episcopal sees.\nThe elections of bishops could be witnessed by the emperor or his representatives. Callixtus II obtained the right to name bishops throughout Germany, but still did not have that power in much of Burgundy and Italy.\nThe First Lateran Council was convoked to confirm the Concordat of Worms. The council was most representative with nearly three hundred bishops and six hundred abbots from every part of Catholic Europe being present. It convened on 18 March 1123. Decrees were also passed directed against simony, concubinage among the clergy, church robbers, and forgers of Church documents; the council also reaffirmed indulgences for Crusaders. The Council ruled that the crusades to the Holy Land and the Reconquista of Spain were of equal standing.\nIn the remaining few years of his life, Callixtus II attempted to secure the status of the Church as it had existed at the end of the reign of Pope Gregory VII. He reorganized and reformed the churches around Rome, canonized Conrad of Constance, condemned the teaching of Peter de Bruis, confirmed the Bishop Thurston of York against the wishes of Henry I of England and affirmed the freedom of York from the see of Canterbury. Callixtus II died on December 13, 1124, and was succeeded by Pope Honorius II.\nCallixtus II was a strong figure who brought a relative, if tentative, peace between Germany and the Church. The Concordat of Worms and the First Lateran Council changed forever the belief in the divine right of kings to name the pope and bishops and reshaped the nature of church and state forever.\nText of the council.\nTexts of the First Lateran Council may vary in both wording and numbering of the canons depending on source.

If anyone violates the truce of God and after the third admonition does not make satisfaction, he shall be anathematized.\nText. If anyone shall violate the truce of God he shall be admonished three times by the bishop to make satisfaction.

We also absolutely forbid any cleric in any way to alienate his prebend or any ecclesiastical benefice. If he has presumed to do this in the past or shall presume to do so in the future, his action shall be null and he shall be subject to the canonical penalties.\nResults of the council.\nLateran I was the first of four Lateran Councils between the years 1123\u20131215. The first was not very original in its concept, nor one called to meet a pressing theological question. For the most part, Pope Callixtus II summoned the council to ratify the various meetings and concords which had been occurring in and around Rome for several years. The most pressing issue was that of the Investiture Controversy which had consumed nearly a century of contention and open warfare. At the heart of the question was the ancient right of the Holy Roman Emperor to name the pope as well as bishops and priests. These would be invested with some secular symbol such as a sword or scepter and the spiritual authority represented by a ring, miter and crosier. To an illiterate population, it appeared the bishop or abbot was now the king's inferior and owed his position to the king. This issue came to the fore in the first part of the eleventh century when Rome and the pope sought autonomy from the Holy Roman Emperor. It had been a central issue in the reign of Pope Gregory VII and his battles with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. The issue was never settled. Years of teaching by Roman trained priests and bishops in Germany had led to an educated generation which rejected the idea of divine right of kings. \nThe Third Lateran Council and the Fourth Lateran Council are generally considered to be of much greater significance than Lateran I. However, Lateran I marked the first time a general and large Council had been held in the West. All previous Councils had been in the East and dominated by Greek theologians and philosophers.\nIn the struggle between Stephen of England and Matilda, the daughter of Henry I of England, the English Church slipped away from the close control the Normans had exercised. Stephen was forced to make many concessions to the Church to gain some element of political control. Historians have largely considered his rule to be a disaster, calling it The Anarchy.\nBecause of political necessity, the Holy Roman Emperors were restrained from directly naming bishops in the kingdom. In practicality, the process continued to a certain extent. The issue of separation of church and state was simply recast in a different direction. Of all the Gregorian Reforms which were embodied by Lateran I, celibacy of the clergy was the most successful. Simony was curtailed. As time progressed, secular interference into the politics of the Church was seen to continue, albeit in different ways from that of the Investiture Controversy.\nIt has been argued by some historians that the Concordat of Worms and its reiteration by Lateran I were little more than face saving measures by the Church. Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor continued to name bishops within his kingdom. His control over the papacy was definitely abated. At the time, the Concordat of Worms was proclaimed as a great victory for Henry V inside the Holy Roman Empire. It did serve to constrain much of the most recent warfare in and outside the empire. In the end, Henry V died the monarch of a much diminished kingdom."}

The four truths are\nThe four truths appear in many grammatical forms in the ancient Buddhist texts, and are traditionally identified as the first teaching given by the Buddha. While often called one of the most important teachings in Buddhism, they have both a symbolic and a propositional function. Symbolically, they represent the awakening and liberation of the Buddha, and of the potential for his followers to reach the same liberation and freedom as him. As propositions, the Four Truths are a conceptual framework that appear in the Pali canon and early Hybrid Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures, as a part of the broader \"network of teachings\" (the \"\"dhamma\" matrix\"), which have to be taken together. They provide a conceptual framework for introducing and explaining Buddhist thought, which has to be personally understood or \"experienced\".\nAs a proposition, the four truths defy an exact definition, but refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism: unguarded sensory contact gives rise to craving and clinging to impermanent states and things, which are \"dukkha\", \"unsatisfactory,\" \"incapable of satisfying\" and painful. This craving keeps us caught in \"sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\", \"wandering\", usually interpreted as the endless cycle of repeated rebirth, and the continued \"dukkha\" that comes with it, but also referring to the endless cycle of attraction and rejection that perpetuates the ego-mind. There is a way to end this cycle, namely by attaining \"nirvana\", cessation of craving, whereafter rebirth and the accompanying \"dukkha\" will no longer arise again. This can be accomplished by following the eightfold path, confining our automatic responses to sensory contact by restraining oneself, cultivating discipline and wholesome states, and practicing mindfulness and \"dhyana\" (meditation).\nThe function of the four truths, and their importance, developed over time and the Buddhist tradition slowly recognized them as the Buddha's first teaching. This tradition was established when \"prajna\", or \"liberating insight\", came to be regarded as liberating in itself, instead of or in addition to the practice of \"dhyana\". This \"liberating insight\" gained a prominent place in the sutras, and the four truths came to represent this liberating insight, as a part of the enlightenment story of the Buddha.\nThe four truths grew to be of central importance in the Theravada tradition of Buddhism by about the 5th-century CE, which holds that the insight into the four truths is liberating in itself. They are less prominent in the Mahayana tradition, which sees the higher aims of insight into \"sunyata\", emptiness, and following the Bodhisattva path as central elements in their teachings and practice. The Mahayana tradition reinterpreted the four truths to explain how a liberated being can still be \"pervasively operative in this world\". Beginning with the exploration of Buddhism by western colonialists in the 19th century and the development of Buddhist modernism, they came to be often presented in the west as the central teaching of Buddhism, sometimes with novel modernistic reinterpretations very different from the historic Buddhist traditions in Asia.\nThe Four Truths.\nFull set \u2013 Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.\nThe four truths are best known from their presentation in the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" text, which contains two sets of the four truths, while various other sets can be found in the P\u0101li Canon, a collection of scriptures in the Theravadan Buddhist tradition. The full set, which is most commonly used in modern expositions, contains grammatical errors, pointing to multiple sources for this set and translation problems within the ancient Buddhist community. Nevertheless, they were considered correct by the Pali tradition, which did not correct them.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\", \"Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion\", contains the first teachings that the Buddha gave after attaining full awakening, and liberation from rebirth. According to L. S. Cousins, many scholars are of the view that \"this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date,\" and according to professor of religion Carol S. Anderson the four truths may originally not have been part of this sutta, but were later added in some versions. Within this discourse, the four noble truths are given as follows (\"bhikkhus\" is normally translated as \"Buddhist monks\"):\nAccording to this sutra, with the complete comprehension of these four truths release from \"samsara\", the cycle of rebirth, was attained:\nThe comprehension of these four truths by his audience leads to the opening of the \"Dhamma Eye\", that is, the attainment of right vision:\nBasic set.\nAccording to K.R. Norman, the basic set is as follows:\nMnemonic set.\nAccording to K. R. Norman, the Pali canon contains various shortened forms of the four truths, the \"mnemonic set\", which were \"intended to remind the hearer of the full form of the NTs.\" The earliest form of the mnemonic set was \"dukkham samudayo nirodho marga\", without the reference to the Pali terms \"sacca\" or \"arya\", which were later added to the formula. The four mnemonic terms can be translated as follows:\nAlternative formulations.\nAccording to L.S. Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where \"dukkha\" is the subject. Other forms take \"the world, the arising of the world\" or \"the \u0101savas, the arising of the \u0101savas\" as their subject. According to Cousins, \"the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms.\" \"The world\" refers to the sa\u1e45kh\u0101ras, that is, all compounded things, or to the six sense spheres.\nThe various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in five skandhas and twelve nid\u0101nas. In the five skandhas, sense-contact with objects leads to sensation and perception; the sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.) determine the interpretation of, and the response to, these sensations and perceptions, and affect consciousness in specific ways. The \"twelve nid\u0101nas\" describe the further process: craving and clinging (\"up\u0101d\u0101na\") lead to \"bhava\" (becoming) and \"j\u0101ti\" (birth).\nIn the orthodox interpretation, \"bhava\" is interpreted as \"kammabhava\", that is , \"karma\", while \"j\u0101ti\" is interpreted as rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth. In Thai Buddhism, \"bhava\" is interpreted as behavior which serves craving and clinging, while \"j\u0101ti\" is interpreted as the repeated birth of the ego or self-sense, which perpetuates the process of self-serving responses and actions.\nTruths for the noble ones.\nThe Pali terms \"ariya sacca\" (Sanskrit: \"arya satya\") are commonly translated as \"noble truths\". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations. According to Paul Williams,\nThe term \"arya\" was later added to the four truths. The term \"ariya\" (Sanskrit: \"arya\") can be translated as \"noble\", \"not ordinary\", \"valuable\", \"precious\". \"pure\". Paul Williams:\nThe term \"sacca\" (Sanskrit: \"satya\") is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as \"truth\"; but it also means \"that which is in accord with reality\", or \"reality\". According to Rupert Gethin, the four truths are \"four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening.\" They function as \"a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\" According to K. R. Norman, probably the best translation is \"the truth[s] of the noble one (the Buddha)\". It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing. Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.\nSymbolic and propositional function.\nAccording to Anderson, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function:\nAs a symbol, they refer to the possibility of awakening, as represented by the Buddha, and are of utmost importance:\nAs a proposition, they are part of the matrix or \"network of teachings\", in which they are \"not particularly central\", but have an equal place next to other teachings, describing how release from craving is to be reached. A long recognized feature of the Theravada canon is that it lacks an \"overarching and comprehensive structure of the path to \"nibbana\".\" The sutras form a network or matrix, and the four truths appear within this \"network of teachings\", which have to be taken together. Within this network, \"the four noble truths are one doctrine among others and are not particularly central\", but are a part of \"the entire \"dhamma\" matrix\". The four noble truths are set and learnt in that network, learning \"how the various teachings intersect with each other\", and refer to the various Buddhist techniques, which are all explicitly and implicitly part of the passages which refer to the four truths. According to Anderson,\nExplanation of the Four Truths.\n\"Dukkha\" and its ending.\nAs a proposition, the four truths defy an exact definition, but refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism: sensory contact gives rise to clinging and craving to temporary states and things, which is ultimately unsatisfactory, \"dukkha\", and sustains \"samsara\", the repeated cycle of \"bhava\" (becoming, habitual tendencies) and \"j\u0101ti\" (\"birth\", interpreted as either rebirth, the coming to be of a new existence; or as the arising of the sense of self as a mental phenomenon).\nBy following the Buddhist path, craving and clinging can be confined, peace of mind and real happiness\ncan be attained, and the repeated cycle of repeated becoming and birth will be stopped.\nThe truth of \"dukkha\", \"incapable of satisfying\", \"painful\", from \"dush-stha\", \"standing unstable,\" is the basic insight that \"samsara\", life in this \"mundane world\", with its clinging and craving to impermanent states and things\" is \"dukkha\", unsatisfactory and painful. We expect happiness from states and things which are impermanent, and therefore cannot attain real happiness.\nThe truth of \"samudaya\", \"arising\", \"coming together\", or \"dukkha-samudaya\", the origination or arising of \"dukkha\", is the truth that \"samsara\", and its associated \"dukkha\" arises, or continues, with ta\u1e47h\u0101, \"thirst\", craving for and clinging to these impermanent states and things.\n In the orthodox view, this clinging and craving produces karma, which leads to renewed becoming, keeping us trapped in rebirth and renewed dissatisfaction. Craving includes \"kama-tanha\", craving for sense-pleasures; \"bhava-tanha\", craving to continue the cycle of life and death, including rebirth; and \"vibhava-tanha\", craving to not experience the world and painful feelings. While \"dukkha-samudaya\", the term in the basic set of the four truths, is traditionally translated and explained as \"the origin (or cause) of suffering\", giving a causal explanation of \"dukkha\", Brazier and Batchelor point to the wider connotations of the term \"samudaya\", \"coming into existence together\": together with \"dukkha\" arises \"tanha\", thirst. Craving does not cause \"dukkha\", but comes into existence together with \"dukkha\", or the five skandhas. It is this craving which is to be confined, as Kondanna understood at the end of the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\": \"whatever arises ceases\".\nThe truth of \"nirodha\", \"cessation,\" \"suppression,\" \"renouncing,\" \"letting go\", or \"dukkha-nirodha\", the cessation of \"dukkha\", is the truth that \"dukkha\" ceases, or can be confined, when one renounces or confines craving and clinging, and nirvana is attained. Alternatively, \"tanha\" itself, as a response to \"dukkha\", is to be confined. \"Nirvana\" refers to the moment of attainment itself, and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (\"khlesa-nirvana\"), but also to the final dissolution of the five skandhas at the time of death (\"skandha-nirvana\" or \"parinirvana\"); in the Theravada-tradition, it also refers to a transcendental reality which is \"known at the moment of awakening\". According to Gethin, \"modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirv\u0101\u1e47a' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirv\u0101\u1e47a' for the death experience. When \"nirvana\" is attained, no more karma is being produced, and rebirth and dissatisfaction will no longer arise again. Cessation is \"nirvana\", \"blowing out\", and peace of mind. Joseph Goldstein explains:\nThe truth of \"magga\", refers to the path to the cessation of, or liberation from \"dukkha\" c.q. \"tanha\". By following the Noble Eightfold Path, to \"moksha\", liberation, restraining oneself, cultivating discipline, and practicing mindfulness and meditation, one starts to disengage from craving and clinging to impermanent states and things, and rebirth and dissatisfaction will be ended. The term \"path\" is usually taken to mean the Noble Eightfold Path, but other versions of \"the path\" can also be found in the Nikayas. The Theravada tradition regards insight into the four truths as liberating in itself.\nThe well-known eightfold path consists of the understanding that this world is fleeting and unsatisfying, and how craving keeps us tied to this fleeting world; a friendly and compassionate attitude to others; a correct way of behaving; mind-control, which means not feeding on negative thoughts, and nurturing positive thoughts; constant awareness of the feelings and responses which arise; and the practice of \"dhyana\", meditation. The tenfold path adds the right (liberating) insight, and liberation from rebirth.\nThe four truths are to be internalised, and understood or \"experienced\" personally, to turn them into a lived reality.\nEnding rebirth.\nThe four truths describe \"dukkha\" and its ending as a means to reach peace of mind in this life, but also as a means to end rebirth.\nAccording to Geoffrey Samuel, \"the Four Noble Truths [...] describe the knowledge needed to set out on the path to liberation from rebirth.\" By understanding the four truths, one can stop this clinging and craving, attain a pacified mind, and be freed from this cycle of rebirth and redeath. Patrick Olivelle explains that moksha is a central concept in Indian religions, and \"literally means freedom from samsara.\" Melvin E. Spiro further explains that \"desire is the cause of suffering because desire is the cause of rebirth.\" When desire ceases, rebirth and its accompanying suffering ceases. Peter Harvey explains:\nThe last sermon, the \"Maha-parinibbana Sutta\" (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16)\", states it as follows:\nOther interpretations.\nAccording to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, \"birth\" does refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the \"emergence of the ego\". According to Buddhadhasa,\nSome contemporary teachers tend to explain the four truths psychologically, by taking \"dukkha\" to mean mental anguish in addition to the physical pain of life, and interpreting the four truths as a means to attain happiness in this life. In the contemporary Vipassana movement that emerged out of the Theravada Buddhism, freedom and the \"pursuit of happiness\" have become the main goals, not the end of rebirth, which is hardly mentioned in their teachings.\nYet, though freedom and happiness is a part of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to Gil Fronsdal, \"when Asian teachers do talk about freedom, it is primarily in reference to what one is free from \u2013 that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth\". \"Nibbana\" is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, \"without drastic changes in lifestyle\". Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives. The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia. According to Spiro, \"the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message\", but an eschatological message.\nHistorical development in early Buddhism.\nAccording to Anderson, \"the four truths are recognized as perhaps the most important teaching of the Buddha.\" Yet, as early as 1935 Caroline Rhys Davids wrote that for a teaching so central to Theravada Buddhism, it was missing from critical passages in the Pali canon. According to Gethin, the four truths and the eightfold path are only two lists of \"literally hundreds of similar lists covering the whole range of the theory and practice of ancient Buddhism.\" The position of the four truths within the canon raises questions, and has been investigated throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\nScholarly analysis of the oldest texts.\nAccording to academic scholars, inconsistencies in the oldest texts may reveal developments in the oldest teachings. While the Theravada-tradition holds that the Sutta Pitaka is \"the definitive recension of the Buddha-word\", and Theravadins argue that it is likely that the sutras date back to the Buddha himself, in an unbroken chain of oral transmission, academic scholars have identified many such inconsistencies, and tried to explain them. Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the Four Noble Truths, has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research. According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished regarding the possibility to retain knowledge of the oldest Buddhism:\nDevelopment.\nGrowing importance.\nBuddhologist Eviatar Shulman proposes that in its original form the Four Truths were rooted in meditative perception of mental events, building on his analysis of the P\u0101li term ayam which is equivalent, he claims, to an immediate perception, such as this here right now in front of me.\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the four truths may already have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, but did not have the central place they acquired in later buddhism. According to Anderson, only by the time of the commentaries, in the fifth century CE, did the four truths come to be identified in the Theravada tradition as the central teaching of the Buddha. According to Anderson,\nAccording to Feer and Anderson, the four truths probably entered the Sutta Pitaka from the Vinaya, the rules for monastic order. They were first added to enlightenment-stories which contain the Four Jhanas, replacing terms for \"liberating insight\". From there they were added to the biographical stories of the Buddha.\nSubstituting \"liberating insight\".\nScholars have noted inconsistencies in the presentations of the Buddha's enlightenment, and the Buddhist path to liberation, in the oldest sutras. They argue that these inconsistencies show that the Buddhist teachings evolved, either during the lifetime of the Buddha, or thereafter. According to the Japanese scholar Ui, the four truths are not the earliest representation of the Buddha's enlightenment. Instead, they are a rather late theory on the content of the Buddha's enlightenment. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of \"dhyana\", leading to a calm of mind and awareness (mindfulness) which according to Vetter \"is\" the liberation which is being sought. Later on, \"liberating insight\" came to be regarded as equally liberating. This \"liberating insight\" came to be exemplified by \"prajna\", or the insight in the \"four truths\", but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of \"liberating insight\" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for \"moksha\", liberation from rebirth. This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,\nAccording to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this \"liberating insight\" was not fixed but developed over time. According to Bronkhorst, in earliest Buddhism the four truths did not serve as a description of \"liberating insight\". Initially the term \"prajna\" served to denote this \"liberating insight\". Later on, \"prajna\" was replaced in the suttas by the \"four truths\". This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of \"liberating insight\", and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in \"liberating insight\". This \"liberating insight\" came to be defined as \"insight into the four truths\", which is presented as the \"liberating insight\" which constituted the awakening, or \"enlightenment\" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths he was \"enlightened\" and liberated, as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: \"his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.\"\nBronkhorst points to an inconsistency, noting that the four truths refer here to the eightfold path as the means to gain liberation, while the attainment of insight into the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself. According to Bronkhorst, this is an inconsistency which reveals a change which took place over time in the composition of the sutras. An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42\u201343, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.\nAccording to Schmithausen, the four truths were superseded by \"pratityasamutpada\", and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person. Schmithausen further states that still other descriptions of this \"liberating insight\" exist in the Buddhist canon:\nIn contrast, Thanissaro Bikkhu presents the view that the four truths, pratityasamutpada and anatta are inextricably intertwined.\nAcquiring the \"dhamma-eye\" and destroying the \"\u0101sav\u0101s\".\nIn their symbolic function, the sutras present the insight into the four truths as the culmination of the Buddha's path to awakening. In the \"Vinayapitaka\" and the \"Sutta-pitaka\" they have the same symbolic function, in a reenactment by his listeners of the Buddha's awakening by attaining the \"dhamma-eye\". In contrast, here this insight serves as the starting point to path-entry for his audience. These sutras present a repeated sequence of events:\nYet, in other sutras, where the four truths have a propositional function, the comprehension of the four truths destroys the corruptions. They do so in combination with the practice of the \"jhanas\" and the attainment of the divine eye, with which past lives and the working of rebirth are being seen.\nAccording to Anderson, following Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, these two presentations give two different models of the path to liberation, reflecting their function as a symbol and as a proposition. Most likely, the four truths were first associated with the culmination of the path in the destruction of the \"\u0101sav\u0101s\", where they substituted the unspecified \"liberating insight\"; as the canon developed, they became more logically associated with the beginning of the Buddhist path.\nPopularisation in the west.\nAccording to Anderson there is a strong tendency within scholarship to present the four truths as the most essential teaching of Buddhism. According to Anderson, the four truths have been simplified and popularized in western writings, due to \"the colonial project of gaining control over Buddhism.\" According to Crosby, the Buddhist teachings are reduced to a \"simple, single rationalized account\", which has parallels in the reinterpretation of the Buddha in western literature.\nThe presentation of the four truths as one of the most important teachings of the Buddha \"has been [done] to reduce the four noble truths to a teaching that is accessible, pliable, and therefore readily appropriated by non-Buddhists.\" There is a great variety of teachings in the Buddhist literature, which may be bewildering for those who are unaware of this variety. The four truths are easily accessible in this regard, and are \"readily [understood] by those outside the Buddhist traditions.\" For example Walpola Rahula's \"What the Buddha Taught\", a widely used introductory text for non-Buddhists, uses the four truths as a framework to present an overview of the Buddhist teachings.\nAccording to Harris, the British in the 19th century crafted new representations of Buddhism and the Buddha. 19th century missionaries studied Buddhism, to be more effective in their missionary efforts. The Buddha was de-mystified, and reduced from a \"superhuman\" to a \"compassionate, heroic human\", serving \"western historical method and the missionary agenda of situating the Buddha firmly below the divine.\" The four truths were discovered by the British by reading the Buddhist texts, and were not immediately granted the central position they later received.\nThe writings of British missionaries show a growing emphasis on the four truths as being central to Buddhism, with somewhat different presentations of them. This colonial project had a strong influence on some strands of Buddhism, culminating in so-called Protestant Buddhism, which incorporated several essentially Protestant attitudes regarding religion, such as the emphasis on written texts. According to Gimello, Rahula's book is an example of this Protestant Buddhism, and \"was created in an accommodating response to western expectations, and in nearly diametrical opposition to Buddhism as it had actually been practised in traditional Theravada.\"\nHendrik Kern proposed in 1882 that the model of the four truths may be an analogy with classical Indian medicine, in which the four truths function as a medical diagnosis, and the Buddha is presented as a physician. Kern's analogy became rather popular, but \"there is not sufficient historical evidence to conclude that the Buddha deliberately drew upon a clearly defined medical model for his fourfold analysis of human pain.\"\nAccording to Anderson, those scholars who did not place the four truths at the center of Buddhism, either \"located the four truths in a fuller reading of the Theravada canon and the larger context of South Asian literature\", or \"located the teaching within an experience of Buddhism as practiced in a contemporary setting.\" According to Anderson, \"these autors suggest a more complex reading of the four noble truths than those who locate the teaching as the key to or as a crucial element within the grand scheme of Buddhism.\"\nAppearance within the discourses.\nThe developing Buddhist tradition inserted the four truths, using various formulations, at various sutras. They are being used both as a symbol of all dhammas and the Buddha's awakening, and as a set of propositions which function within a matrix of teachings. According to Anderson, there is no single way to understand the teachings; one teaching may be used to explain another teaching, and vice versa. The teachings form a network, which should be apprehended as such to understand how the various teachings intersect with each other.\nSymbolic function.\n\"Mahasaccaka Sutta\".\nThe \"Mahasaccaka Sutta\" (\"The Greater Discourse to Saccaka\", Majjhima Nikaya 36) gives one of several versions of the Buddha's way to liberation. He attains the three knowledges, namely knowledge of his former lifes, knowledge of death and rebirth, and knowledge of the destruction of the taints, the Four Noble Truths. After going through the four dhyanas, and gaining the first two knowledges, the story proceeds:\nBronkhorst dismisses the first two knowledges as later additions, and proceeds to notice that the recognition of the intoxicants is modelled on the four truths. According to Bronkhorst, those are added the bridge the original sequence of \"I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants. My mind was liberated\", which was interrupted by the addition of the four truths. Bronkhorst points out that those do not fit here, since the four truths culminate in the knowledge of the path to be followed, while the Buddha himself is already liberated at that point.\n\"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\".\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the first talk of Gautama Buddha after he attained enlightenment is recorded in the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" (\"Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma\", Samyutta Nikaya 56.11). The \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" provides details on three stages in the understanding of each truth, for a total of twelve insights. The three stages for understanding each truth are:\nThese three stages of understanding are emphasized particularly in the Theravada tradition, but they are also recognized by some contemporary Mahayana teachers.\nAccording to Cousins, many scholars are of the view that \"this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date.\" According to Stephen Batchelor, the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" contains incongruities, and states that\nAccording to Bronkhorst this \"first sermon\" is recorded in several sutras, with important variations. In the Vinaya texts, and in the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" which was influenced by the Vinaya texts, the four truths are included, and Konda\u00f1\u00f1a is enlightened when the \"vision of Dhamma\" arises in him: \"whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.\" Yet, in the \"Ariyapariyesan\u0101 Sutta\" (\"The Noble Search\", Majjhima Nikaya 26) the four truths are not included, and the Buddha gives the five ascetics personal instructions in turn, two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food. The versions of the \"first sermon\" which include the four truths, such as the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\", omit this instruction, showing that\nAccording to Bronkhorst, this indicates that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally was thought to be sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas. Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the \"twelve insights\" are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term \"prajna\" for the more specific \"four truths\".\n\"Maha-parinibbana Sutta\".\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the \"Maha-parinibbana Sutta\" (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16) was given near the end of the Buddha's life. This sutta \"gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching:\"\nPropositional function.\n\"Maha-salayatanika Sutta\".\nThe \"Maha-salayatanika Sutta\", Majjhima Nikaya 149:3 plus 149:9, give an alternative presentation of the four truths:\nEmphasis within different traditions.\nEarly Indian Buddhism.\nThe Ekavy\u0101vah\u0101rika sect emphasized the transcendence of the Buddha, asserting that he was eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavy\u0101vah\u0101rika, the words of the Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in one moment of insight. According to the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.\nTheravada.\nAccording to Carol Anderson, the four truths have \"a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition.\" The Theravada tradition regards insight in the four truths as liberating in itself. As Walpola Rahula states, \"when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of samsara in illusion become calm and incapable of producing any more karma-formations [...] he is free from [...] the 'thirst' for becoming.\" This liberation can be attained in one single moment, when the four truths are understood together. Within the Theravada tradition, great emphasis is placed upon reading and contemplating \"The Discourse That Sets Turning the Wheel of Truth\", and other suttas, as a means to study the four noble truths and put them into practice. For example, Ajahn Sumedho states:\nWithin the Theravada-tradition, three different stances on \"nirvana\" and the question what happens with the \"Arhat\" after death can be found. \"Nirvana\" refers to the cessation of the defilements and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (\"khlesa-nirvana\"); to the final dissolution of the five skandhas at the time of death (\"skandha-nirvana\" or \"parinirvana\"); and to a transcendental reality which is \"known at the moment of awakening\". According to Gethin, \"modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirv\u0101\u1e47a' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirv\u0101\u1e47a' for the death experience. According to Geisler and Amano, in the \"minimal Theravada interpretation\", \"nirvana\" is a psychological state, which ends with the dissolution of the body and the total extinction of existence. According to Geisler and Amano, the \"orthodox Theravada interpretation\" is that nirvana is a transcendent reality with which the self unites. According to Bronkhorst, while \"Buddhism preached liberation in this life, i.e. before death\", there was also a tendency in Buddhism to think of liberation happening after death. According to Bronkhorst, this\nAccording to Walpola Rahula, the cessation of \"dukkha\" is \"nirvana\", the \"summum bonum\" of Buddhism, and is attained in this life, not when one dies. \"Nirvana\" is \"perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness\", and \"Absolute Truth\", which simply \"is\". Jayatilleke also speaks of \"the attainment of an ultimate reality\". According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the \"elimination of craving culminates not only in the extinction of sorrow, anguish and distress, but in the unconditioned freedom of nibbana, which is won with the ending of repeated rebirth.\"\nAccording to Spiro, most (lay) Theravada Buddhists do not aspire for \"nirvana\" and total extinction, but for a pleasurable rebirth in heaven. According to Spiro, this presents a \"serious conflict\" since the Buddhist texts and teaching \"describe life as suffering and hold up nirvana as the \"summum bonum.\"\" In response to this deviation, \"monks and others emphasize that the hope for nirvana is the only legitimate action for Buddhist action.\" Nevertheless, according to Spiro most Burmese lay Buddhists do not aspire for the extinction of existence which is \"nirvana\".\nAccording to B.R. Ambedkar, the Indian Buddhist Dalit leader, the four truths were not part of the original teachings of the Buddha, but a later aggregation, due to Hindu influences. According to Ambedkar, total cessation of suffering is an illusion; yet, the Buddhist Middle Path aims at the reduction of suffering and the maximizing of happiness, balancing both sorrow and happiness.\nMahayana.\nThe four truths are less prominent in the Mahayana traditions, which emphasize insight into \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101 and the Bodhisattva path as a central elements in their teachings. If the sutras in general are studied at all, it is through various Mahayana commentaries.\nAccording to Makransky the Mahayana Bodhisattva ideal created tensions in the explanation of the four truths. In the Mahayana view, a fully enlightened Buddha does not leave \"samsara\", but remains in the world out of compassion for all sentient beings. The four truths, which aim at ending \"samsara\", do not provide a doctrinal basis for this view, and had to be reinterpreted. In the old view, \"klesas\" and \"karma\" are the cause of prolonged existence. According to Makransky, \"[t]o remove those causes was, at physical death, to extinguish one's conditioned existence, hence to end forever one's participation in the world (Third Truth).\" According to Makransky, the question of how a liberated being can still be \"pervasively operative in this world\" has been \"a seminal source of ongoing doctrinal tension over Buddhahood throughout the history of the Mahayana in India and Tibet.\"\nTibetan Buddhism.\nAtisha, in his \"Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa\" (\"A Lamp for the Path to Awakening\"), which forms the basis for the Lamrim tradition, discerns three levels of motivation for Buddhist practitioners. At the beginning level of motivation, one strives toward a better life in \"samsara\". At the intermediate level, one strives to a liberation from existence in samsara and the end of all suffering. At the highest level of motivation, one strives after the liberation of all living beings. In his commentary on the text, Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche explains that the four truths are to be meditated upon as a means of practice for the intermediate level.\nAccording to Geshe Tashi Tsering, within Tibetan Buddhism, the four noble truths are studied as part of the Bodhisattva path. They are explained in Mahayana commentaries such as the \"Abhisamayalamkara\", a summary of and commentary on the Prajna Paramita sutras, where they form part of the lower Hinayana teachings. The truth of the path (the fourth truth) is traditionally presented according to a progressive formula of five paths, rather than as the eightfold path presented in Theravada. According to Tsering, the study of the four truths is combined with the study of the sixteen characteristics of the four noble truths.\nSome contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teachers have provided commentary on the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" and the noble eightfold path when presenting the dharma to Western students.\nThe truths are used extensively within Sowa Rigpa (traditional Tibetan medicine) theory.\nNichiren Buddhism.\nNichiren Buddhism is based on the teaching of the Japanese priest and teacher Nichiren, who believed that the Lotus S\u016btra contained the essence of all of Gautama Buddha's teachings. The third chapter of the Lotus Sutra states that the Four Noble Truths was the early teaching of the Buddha, while the Dharma of the Lotus is the \"most wonderful, unsurpassed great Dharma\". The teachings on the four noble truths are a provisional teaching, which Shakyamuni Buddha taught according to the people's capacity, while the Lotus Sutra is a direct statement of Shakyamuni's own enlightenment.\nWestern Buddhism.\nFor many western Buddhists, the rebirth doctrine in the Four Noble Truths teaching is a problematic notion. According to Lamb, \"Certain forms of modern western Buddhism [...] see it as purely mythical and thus a dispensable notion.\" According to Coleman, the focus of most vipassana students in the west \"is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom.\" According to Damien Keown, westerners find \"the ideas of karma and rebirth puzzling.\" According to Gowans, many Western followers and people interested in exploring Buddhism are skeptical and object to the belief in karma and rebirth foundational to the Four Noble Truths. According to Konik,\nAccording to Keown, it is possible to reinterpret the Buddhist doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths, since the final goal and the answer to the problem of suffering is nirvana, and not rebirth. Some Western interpreters have proposed what is sometimes referred to as \"naturalized Buddhism\". It is devoid of rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms of existence, and other concepts of Buddhism, with doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths reformulated and restated in modernistic terms. This \"deflated secular Buddhism\" stresses compassion, impermanence, causality, selfless persons, no Boddhisattvas, no nirvana, no rebirth, and a naturalist's approach to well-being of oneself and others.\nAccording to Melford Spiro, this approach undermines the Four Noble Truths, for it does not address the existential question for the Buddhist as to \"why live? why not commit suicide, hasten the end of \"dukkha\" in current life by ending life\". In traditional Buddhism, rebirth continues the \"dukkha\" and the path to cessation of \"dukkha\" isn't suicide, but the fourth reality of the Four Noble Truths. The \"naturalized Buddhism\", according to Gowans, is a radical revision to traditional Buddhist thought and practice, and it attacks the structure behind the hopes, needs and rationalization of the realities of human life to traditional Buddhists in East, Southeast and South Asia. According to Keown, it may not be necessary to believe in some of the core Buddhist doctrines to be a Buddhist, but the rebirth, karma, realms of existence and cyclic universe doctrines underpin the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.\nTraditional Buddhist scholars disagree with these modernist Western interpretations. Bhikkhu Bodhi, for example, states that rebirth is an integral part of the Buddhist teachings as found in the sutras, despite the problems that \"modernist interpreters of Buddhism\" seem to have with it. Thanissaro Bhikkhu, as another example, rejects the \"modern argument\" that \"one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth.\" He states, \"rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition.\"\nAccording to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that \"Buddhists believe in rebirth\" and that this belief has been common among his followers. However, the Dalai Lama's belief, adds Flanagan, is more sophisticated than ordinary Buddhists, because it is not the same as reincarnation\u2014rebirth in Buddhism is envisioned as happening without the assumption of an \"atman, self, soul\", but rather through a \"consciousness conceived along the anatman lines\". The doctrine of rebirth is considered mandatory in Tibetan Buddhism, and across many Buddhist sects.\nAccording to Christopher Gowans, for \"most ordinary Buddhists, today as well as in the past, their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth\". Buddhist morality hinges on the hope of well being in this lifetime or in future rebirths, with nirvana (enlightenment) a project for a future lifetime. A denial of karma and rebirth undermines their history, moral orientation and religious foundations. According to Keown, most Buddhists in Asia do accept these traditional teachings, and seek better rebirth.\nNavayana Buddhism.\nThe Navayana, a modernistic interpretation of Buddhism by the Indian leader and Buddhist scholar B. R. Ambedkar, rejected much of traditional Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths, karma and rebirth, thus turning his new religion into a vehicle for class struggle and social action. According to Ambedkar, Four Noble Truths was \"the invention of wrong-headed monks\"."}

The calendar consisted of twelve 30-day months, each divided into three 10-day cycles similar to weeks, plus five or six intercalary days at the end to fill out the balance of a solar year. It was designed in part to remove all religious and royalist influences from the calendar, and it was part of a larger attempt at dechristianisation and decimalisation in France (which also included decimal time of day, decimalisation of currency, and metrication). It was used in government records in France and other areas under French rule, including Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Malta, and Italy.\nHistory.\nThe National Constituent Assembly at first intended to create a new calendar marking the \"era of Liberty\", beginning on 14 July 1789, the date of the storming of the Bastille. However, on 2 January 1792 its successor the Legislative Assembly decided that Year IV of Liberty had begun the day before. Year I had therefore begun on 1 January 1789.\nOn 21 September 1792 the French First Republic was proclaimed, and the new National Convention decided that 1792 was to be known as Year I of the French Republic. It decreed on 2 January 1793 that Year II of the Republic had begun the day before. However, the new calendar as adopted by the Convention in October 1793 made 22 September 1792 the first day of Year I. The Common Era, commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, was abolished and replaced with , the Republican Era, signifying the \"age of reason\" overcoming superstition, as part of the campaign of dechristianisation. \nThe calendar is frequently named the \"French Revolutionary Calendar\" because it was created during the revolution, but this is a slight misnomer. In France, it is known as the \"calendrier r\u00e9publicain\" as well as the \"calendrier r\u00e9volutionnaire\". There was initially a debate as to whether the calendar should celebrate the revolution, which began in July 1789, or the Republic, which was established in 1792. Immediately following 14 July 1789, papers and pamphlets started calling 1789 year I of Liberty and the following years II and III. It was in 1792, with the practical problem of dating financial transactions, that the legislative assembly was confronted with the problem of the calendar. Originally, the choice of epoch was either 1 January 1789 or 14 July 1789. After some hesitation the assembly decided on 2 January 1792 that all official documents would use the \"era of Liberty\" and that the year IV of Liberty started on 1 January 1792. This usage was modified on 22 September 1792 when the Republic was proclaimed and the Convention decided that all public documents would be dated Year I of the French Republic. The decree of 2 January 1793 stipulated that the year II of the Republic began on 1 January 1793; this was revoked with the introduction of the calendar, which set 22 September 1793 as the beginning of year II. The establishment of the Republic was used as the epochal date for the calendar; therefore, the calendar commemorates the Republic, and not the Revolution.\nThe Concordat of 1801 re-established the Roman Catholic Church as an official institution in France, although not as the state religion of France. The concordat took effect from Easter Sunday, 28 Germinal, Year XI (8 April 1802); it restored the names of the days of the week to the ones from the Gregorian calendar, and fixed Sunday as the official day of rest and religious celebration. However, the other attributes of the republican calendar, the months, and years, remained as they were. \nThe First Republic ended with the coronation of Napoleon I as emperor on 11 Frimaire, Year XIII, or 2 December 1804. Despite this, the republican calendar continued to be used until 1 January 1806, when Napoleon declared it abolished. It was used again briefly in the \"Journal officiel\" for some dates during a short period of the Paris Commune, 6\u201323 May 1871 (16 Flor\u00e9al\u20133 Prairial Year LXXIX).\nOverview and origins.\nPrecursor.\nThe prominent atheist essayist and philosopher Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal published the first edition of his \"Almanach des Honn\u00eates-gens\" (Almanac of Honest People) in 1788. The first month in the almanac is \"Mars, ou Princeps\" (March, or First), the last month is \"F\u00e9vrier, ou Duod\u00e9cembre\" (February, or Twelfth). The lengths of the months are the same as those in the Gregorian calendar; however, the 10th, 20th, and 30th days are singled out of each month as the end of a \"d\u00e9cade\" (group of ten days). Individual days were assigned, instead of to the traditional saints, to people noteworthy for mostly secular achievements. Later editions of the almanac would switch to the Republican Calendar.\nDevelopment and usage.\nThe days of the French Revolution and First French Republic saw many efforts to sweep away various trappings of the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\" (the old feudal monarchy); some of these were more successful than others. The new Republican government sought to institute, among other reforms, a new social and legal system, a new system of weights and measures (which became the metric system), and a new calendar. \nAmid nostalgia for the ancient Roman Republic, the theories of the Age of Enlightenment were at their peak, and the devisers of the new systems looked to nature for their inspiration. Natural constants, multiples of ten, and Latin as well as Ancient Greek derivations formed the fundamental blocks from which the systems were built.\nThe calendar was created by a commission under the direction of the politician Gilbert Romme seconded by and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Dupuis. They associated with their work chemist Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange, astronomer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande, mathematician Gaspard Monge, astronomer and naval geographer Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9, and poet, actor and playwright Fabre d'\u00c9glantine (who invented the names of the months) with the help of Andr\u00e9 Thouin (gardener at the Jardin des plantes of the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris). As the rapporteur of the commission, Romme presented the calendar to the Jacobin-controlled National Convention on 23 September 1793, which adopted it on 24 October 1793 and also extended it proleptically to its epoch of 22 September 1792. It is because of his position as rapporteur of the commission that the creation of the republican calendar is attributed to Romme.\nFrench coins of the period used the calendar. Many show the year () in Arabic numerals, although Roman numerals were used on some issues. Year 11 coins typically have a \"XI\" date to avoid confusion with the Roman \"II\". \nDesign.\nYears appear in writing as Roman numerals (usually). Roman numeral I indicates the first year of the republic, that is, the year before the calendar actually came into use. By law, the beginning of each year was set at midnight, beginning on the day the apparent autumnal equinox falls at the Paris Observatory.\nThere were twelve months, each divided into three 10-day weeks called \"d\u00e9cades\". The tenth day, \"d\u00e9cadi\", replaced Sunday as the day of rest and festivity. The five or six extra days needed to approximate the solar or tropical year were placed after the final month of each year and called complementary days. This arrangement was an almost exact copy of the calendar used by the Ancient Egyptians, though in their case the year did not begin and end on the autumnal equinox.\nA period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a \"Franciade\". The name \"Olympique\" was originally proposed but changed to Franciade to commemorate the fact that it had taken the revolution four years to establish a republican government in France. The leap year was called \"Sextile\", an allusion to the \"bissextile\" leap years of the Julian and Gregorian calendars, because it contained a sixth complementary day.\nEach day was divided into ten hours, each hour into 100 decimal minutes, and each decimal minute into 100 decimal seconds. Thus an hour was 144 conventional minutes (2.4 times as long as a conventional hour), a minute was 86.4 conventional seconds (44% longer than a conventional minute), and a second was 0.864 conventional seconds (13.6% shorter than a conventional second). Clocks were manufactured to display this decimal time, but it did not catch on. Mandatory use of decimal time was officially suspended 7 April 1795, although some cities continued to use decimal time as late as 1801. The numbering of years by Roman numerals ran counter to this general decimalisation tendency.\nMonths.\nThe month names were based on nature, principally having to do with the prevailing weather in and around Paris and sometimes evoking the Medieval Labours of the Months. The extra five or six days in the year were not given a month designation but considered or complementary days. Most of the month names were new words coined from French, Latin, or Greek. The endings of the names were grouped by season. comes from , means 'giving' in Greek.\nIn Britain, a contemporary wit mocked the calendar by calling the months: Wheezy, Sneezy, and Freezy; Slippy, Drippy, and Nippy; Showery, Flowery, and Bowery; Hoppy, Croppy, and Poppy. Historian Thomas Carlyle suggests somewhat more serious English names in his 1837 work \"\", namely Vintagearious, Fogarious, Frostarious, Snowous, Rainous, Windous, Buddal, Floweral, Meadowal, Reapidor, Heatidor, and Fruitidor. Like the French originals, they are neologisms suggesting a meaning related to the season.\nDays.\nEach month was divided into three \"d\u00e9cades\" or \"weeks\" of ten days each, named:\nD\u00e9cadis became an official day of rest instead of Sunday, in order to diminish the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. They were used for the festivals of a succession of new religions meant to replace Catholicism: the Cult of Reason, the Cult of the Supreme Being, the Decadary Cult, and Theophilanthropy. Christian holidays were officially abolished in favor of revolutionary holidays. The law of 13 Fructidor year VI (30 August 1798) required that marriages must only be celebrated on d\u00e9cadis. This law was applied from the 1st Vend\u00e9miaire year VII (22 September 1798) to 28 Pluvi\u00f4se year VIII (17 February 1800).\nFive extra days \u2013 six in leap years \u2013 were national holidays at the end of every year. These were originally known as \"les sans-culottides\" (after \"sans-culottes\"), but after year III (1795) as \"les jours compl\u00e9mentaires\":\nRural calendar.\nThe Roman Catholic Church used a calendar of saints, which named each day of the year after an associated saint. To reduce the influence of the Church, Fabre d'\u00c9glantine introduced a rural calendar in which each day of the year had a unique name associated with the rural economy, stated to correspond to the time of year. Every \"d\u00e9cadi\" (ending in 0) was named after an agricultural tool. Each \"quintidi\" (ending in 5) was named for a common animal. The rest of the days were named for \"grain, pasture, trees, roots, flowers, fruits\" and other plants, except for the first month of winter, Niv\u00f4se, during which the rest of the days were named after minerals.\nCriticism and shortcomings.\nLeap years in the calendar are a point of great dispute, due to the contradicting statements in the establishing decree stating:\nand:\nThese two specifications are incompatible, as leap years defined by the autumnal equinox in Paris do not recur on a regular four-year schedule. It was erroneously believed that one leap day would be skipped automatically every 129 years, on average, but actually five years would sometimes pass between leap years, about three times per century. Thus, the years III, VII, and XI were observed as leap years, and the years XV and XX were also planned as such, even though they were five years apart.\nA fixed arithmetic rule for determining leap years was proposed by Delambre and presented to the Committee of Public Education by Romme on 19\u00a0Flor\u00e9al\u00a0An\u00a0III (8 May 1795). The proposed rule was to determine leap years by applying the rules of the Gregorian calendar to the years of the French Republic (years IV, VIII, XII, etc. were to be leap years) except that year 4000 (the last year of ten 400-year periods) should be a common year instead of a leap year. Shortly thereafter, Romme was sentenced to the guillotine and committed suicide, and the proposal was never adopted, although J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande repeatedly proposed it for a number of years. The proposal was intended to avoid uncertain future leap years caused by the inaccurate astronomical knowledge of the 1790s (even today, this statement is still valid due to the uncertainty in \u0394T). In particular, the committee noted that the autumnal equinox of year 144 was predicted to occur at 11:59:40\u00a0pm local apparent time in Paris, which was closer to midnight than its inherent 3 to 4\u00a0minute uncertainty.\nThe calendar was abolished by an act dated 22 Fructidor an XIII (9 September 1805) and signed by Napoleon, which referred to a report by Michel-Louis-\u00c9tienne Regnaud de Saint-Jean d'Ang\u00e9ly and Jean Joseph Mounier, listing two fundamental flaws.\nThe report also notes that the 10-day d\u00e9cade was unpopular and had already been suppressed three years earlier in favor of the seven-day week, removing what was considered by some as one of the calendar's main benefits. The 10-day d\u00e9cade was unpopular with laborers because they received only one full day of rest out of ten, instead of one in seven, although they also got a half-day off on the fifth day (thus 36 full days and 36 half days in a year, for a total of 54 free days, compared to the usual 52 or 53 Sundays). It also, by design, conflicted with Sunday religious observances.\nAnother criticism of the calendar was that despite the poetic names of its months, they were tied to the climate and agriculture of metropolitan France and therefore not applicable to France's overseas territories.\nGallery.\nThe following pictures, showing twelve allegories for the months, were illustrated by French painter Louis Lafitte and engraved by .\nConversion to conventional timekeeping.\nDuring the Republic.\nBelow are the Gregorian dates each year of the Republican Era (\"\u00c8re R\u00e9publicaine\" in French) began while the calendar was in effect.\n Leap years are highlighted\nAfter the Republic.\nThe Republican Calendar was abolished in the year XIV (1805). After this year, there are two historically attested calendars which may be used to determine dates. Both calendars gave the same dates for years 17 to 52 (1808\u20131844), always beginning on 23 September, and it was suggested, but never adopted, that the reformed calendar be implemented during this period, before the Republican Calendar was abolished.\nLeap years are highlighted\nCurrent date and time.\nFor this calendar, Delambre's revised method of calculating leap years is used. Other methods may differ by one day. Time may be cached and therefore not accurate. Decimal time is according to Paris mean time, which is 9 minutes 21 seconds (6.49 decimal minutes) ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. (This tool calibrates the time, if calibration is desired.)\nReferences to the calendar.\nThe \"Coup of 18 Brumaire\" or \"Brumaire\" was the coup d'\u00e9tat of Napoleon Bonaparte on 18 Brumaire An VIII (9 November 1799), which many historians consider to be the end of the French Revolution. Karl Marx's 1852 essay \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\" compares the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851 of Louis Napol\u00e9on unfavorably to his uncle's earlier coup, with the statement \"History repeats ... first as tragedy, then as farce\".\nAnother famous revolutionary date is 9 Thermidor An II (27 July 1794), the date the Convention turned against Maximilien Robespierre, who, along with others associated with the Mountain, was guillotined the following day. Based on this event, the term \"Thermidorian\" entered the Marxist vocabulary as referring to revolutionaries who destroy the revolution from the inside and turn against its true aims. For example, Leon Trotsky and his followers used this term about Joseph Stalin.\n\u00c9mile Zola's novel \"Germinal\" takes its name from the calendar's month of Germinal.\nThe seafood dish Lobster Thermidor was named after the 1891 play \"Thermidor\", set during the Revolution.\nThe French frigates of the \"Flor\u00e9al\" class all bear names of Republican months."}
{"id": "11397", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11397", "title": "Freeman Dyson", "text": "Freeman John Dyson (15 December 1923\u00a0\u2013 28 February 2020) was a British-American theoretical physicist and mathematician known for his works in quantum field theory, astrophysics, random matrices, mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, and engineering. He was professor emeritus in the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and a member of the board of sponsors of the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\".\nDyson originated several concepts that bear his name, such as Dyson's transform, a fundamental technique in additive number theory, which he developed as part of his proof of Mann's theorem; the Dyson tree, a hypothetical genetically engineered plant capable of growing in a comet; the Dyson series, a perturbative series where each term is represented by Feynman diagrams; the Dyson sphere, a thought experiment that attempts to explain how a space-faring civilization would meet its energy requirements with a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star and captures a large percentage of its power output; and Dyson's eternal intelligence, a means by which an immortal society of intelligent beings in an open universe could escape the prospect of the heat death of the universe by extending subjective time to infinity while expending only a finite amount of energy.\nDyson disagreed with the scientific consensus on climate change. He believed that some of the effects of increased CO levels are favourable and not taken into account by climate scientists, such as increased agricultural yield, and further that the positive benefits of CO likely outweigh the negative effects. He was sceptical about the simulation models used to predict climate change, arguing that political efforts to reduce causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nDyson was born on 15 December 1923, in Crowthorne in Berkshire, England. He was the son of Mildred () and the composer George Dyson, who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker. Dyson had one sibling, his older sister, Alice, who remembered him as a boy surrounded by encyclopedias and always calculating on sheets of paper. At the age of four he tried to calculate the number of atoms in the Sun. As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the Solar System, and was strongly influenced by the 1937 book \"Men of Mathematics\" by Eric Temple Bell. Politically, Dyson said he was \"brought up as a socialist\".\nFrom 1936 to 1941 Dyson was a scholar at Winchester College, where his father was Director of Music. At the age of 17 he studied pure mathematics with Abram Besicovitch as his tutor at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a scholarship at age 15. During this stay, Dyson also practised night climbing on the university buildings, and once walked from Cambridge to London in a day with his friend Oscar Hahn, nephew of Kurt Hahn, who was a wheelchair user due to polio.\nAt the age of 19 he was assigned to war work in the Operational Research Section (ORS) of RAF Bomber Command, where he developed analytical methods for calculating the ideal density for bomber formations to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the Second World War. After the war, Dyson was readmitted to Trinity College, where he obtained a BA degree in mathematics. From 1946 to 1949 he was a fellow of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who resigned his professorship in 1947.\nIn 1947 Dyson published two papers in number theory. Friends and colleagues described him as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends found refreshing but intellectual opponents found exasperating. \"I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice\", Steven Weinberg said of him. His friend the neurologist and author Oliver Sacks said: \"A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life.\"\nCareer in the United States.\nOn G. I. Taylor's advice and recommendation, Dyson moved to the United States in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow for postgraduate study with Hans Bethe at Cornell University (1947\u20131948). There he made the acquaintance of Richard Feynman. Dyson recognized the brilliance of Feynman and worked with him. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948\u20131949), before returning to England (1949\u201351), where he was a research fellow at the University of Birmingham. In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two formulations of quantum electrodynamics (QED): Richard Feynman's diagrams and the operator method developed by Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga. He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of Feynman diagrams and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool but a physical theory and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the renormalization problem. Dyson's paper and his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. J. Robert Oppenheimer, in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the Dyson series. It was this paper that inspired John Ward to derive his celebrated Ward\u2013Takahashi identity.\nDyson joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor in 1951, though he still had no doctorate. In December 1952, Oppenheimer, the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, offered Dyson a lifetime appointment at the institute, \"for proving me wrong\", in Oppenheimer's words. Dyson remained at the Institute until the end of his career. In 1957 he became a US citizen. From 1957 to 1961 Dyson worked on Project Orion, which proposed the possibility of space-flight using nuclear pulse propulsion. A prototype was demonstrated using conventional explosives, but the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, in which Dyson was involved and which he supported, permitted only underground nuclear weapons testing, and the project was abandoned in 1965.\nIn 1958 Dyson was a member of the design team under Edward Teller for TRIGA, a small, inherently safe nuclear reactor used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of medical isotopes.\nIn 1966, independently of Elliott H. Lieb and Walter Thirring, Dyson and Andrew Lenard published a paper proving that the Pauli exclusion principle plays the main role in the stability of matter. Hence it is not the electromagnetic repulsion between outer-shell orbital electrons that prevents two stacked wood blocks from coalescing into a single piece, but the exclusion principle applied to electrons and protons that generates the classical macroscopic normal force. In condensed matter physics, Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the Ising model in one dimension and spin waves.\nDyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and random matrices. In 1973 the number theorist Hugh Lowell Montgomery was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his pair correlation conjecture concerning the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. He showed his formula to the mathematician Atle Selberg, who said that it looked like something in mathematical physics and that Montgomery should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the pair correlation function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, which physicists have studied extensively. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the distribution of primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11,\u00a0...) and the energy levels in the nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium.\nAround 1979 Dyson worked with the Institute for Energy Analysis on climate studies. This group, under Alvin Weinberg's direction, pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, Dyson worked on climate studies conducted by the JASON defense advisory group.\nDyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994. In 1998 he joined the board of the Solar Electric Light Fund. In 2003 he was president of the Space Studies Institute, the space research organization founded by Gerard K. O'Neill; in 2013 he was on its board of trustees. Dyson was a longtime member of the JASON group.\nDyson won numerous scientific awards, but never a Nobel Prize. Nobel physics laureate Steven Weinberg said that the Nobel committee \"fleeced\" Dyson, but Dyson remarked in 2009, \"I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style.\" Dyson was a regular contributor to \"The New York Review of Books\", and published a memoir, \"Maker of Patterns: An Autobiography Through Letters\" in 2018.\nIn 2012 Dyson published (with William H. Press) a fundamental new result about the prisoner's dilemma in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. He wrote a foreword to a treatise on psychic phenomena in which he concluded that \"ESP is real... but cannot be tested with the clumsy tools of science\".\nPersonal life and death.\nDyson married his first wife, the Swiss mathematician Verena Huber, on 11 August 1950. They had two children, Esther and George, before divorcing in 1958. In November 1958 he married Imme Jung (born 1936) and they had four more children: Dorothy, Mia, Rebecca, and Emily Dyson.\nDyson's eldest daughter, Esther, is a digital technology consultant and investor; she has been called \"the most influential woman in all the computer world\". His son George is a historian of science, one of whose books is \"Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957\u20131965\".\nDyson died on 28 February 2020 at Penn Medicine Princeton Medical Center in Plainsboro Township, New Jersey, from complications following a fall. He was 96.\nConcepts.\nBiotechnology and genetic engineering.\nDyson admitted his record as a prophet was mixed, but thought it is better to be wrong than vague, and that in meeting the world's material needs, technology must be beautiful and cheap.\nDyson coined the term \"green technologies\", based on biology instead of physics or chemistry, to describe new species of microorganisms and plants designed to meet human needs. He argued that such technologies would be based on solar power rather than the fossil fuels whose use he saw as part of what he calls \"gray technologies\" of industry. He believed that genetically engineered crops, which he described as green, can help end rural poverty, with a movement based in ethics to end the inequitable distribution of wealth on the planet.\n\"The Origin of Life\".\nDyson favoured the dual origin theory: that life first formed as cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian biochemist, Alexander Oparin. J. B. S. Haldane developed the same theory independently. In Dyson's version of the theory, life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. Because of the biochemistry, he regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process. Current cells contain adenosine triphosphate or ATP and adenosine 5'-monophosphate or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposed that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication came into existence only because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggested that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed Eigen's experiment and produced RNA.\nThere is no direct evidence for the dual origin theory, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and having a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these \"little city economies\" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.\nDyson sphere.\nIn 1960 Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal \"Science\" titled \"Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation\". In it he speculated that a technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization might surround its native star with artificial structures to maximize the capture of the star's energy. Eventually, the civilization would enclose the star, intercepting electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from visible light downward and radiating waste heat outward as infrared radiation. One method of searching for extraterrestrial civilizations would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nDyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of asteroid-sized space habitats, though science fiction writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often called a Dyson sphere, although Dyson used the term \"shell\". Dyson said that he used the term \"artificial biosphere\" in the article to mean a habitat, not a shape. The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been created decades earlier by science fiction writer Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\", a source which Dyson credited publicly.\nDyson tree.\nDyson also proposed the creation of a \"Dyson tree\", a genetically engineered plant capable of growing inside a comet. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer Solar System.\nSpace colonies.\nDyson was interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such science fiction classics as Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\". As a young man, he worked for General Atomics on the nuclear-powered Orion spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, and Saturn by 1970. For a quarter-century, Dyson was unhappy about how the government conducted space travel:\nDyson still hoped for cheap space travel, but was resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new and inexpensive.\nDyson's eternal intelligence.\nDyson proposed that an immortal group of intelligent beings could escape the prospect of heat death by extending time to infinity while expending only a finite amount of energy. This is also known as the Dyson scenario.\nDyson's transform.\nHis concept \"Dyson's transform\" led to one of the most important lemmas of Olivier Ramar\u00e9's theorem: that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.\nDyson series.\nThe Dyson series, the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator formula_1 an entity of basic importance in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, are also named after Dyson.\nQuantum physics and prime numbers.\nDyson and Hugh Montgomery discovered an intriguing connection between quantum physics and Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture about the zeros of the zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19... are described by the Riemann zeta function, and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers. Montgomery and Dyson discovered that the \"eigenvalues\" of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function. Andrew Odlyzko has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his Odlyzko\u2013Sch\u00f6nhage algorithm to calculate many zeros.\nThere are in nature one, two, and three-dimensional quasicrystals. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose Fourier transform is also a set of discrete points. Odlyzko has done extensive computations of the Fourier transform of the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function, and they seem to form a one-dimensional quasicrystal. This would in fact follow from the Riemann hypothesis.\nRank of a partition.\nIn number theory and combinatorics, the rank of an integer partition is a certain integer associated with the partition. Dyson introduced the concept in a paper published in the journal \"Eureka\". It was presented in the context of a study of certain congruence properties of the partition function discovered by the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.\nCrank of a partition.\nIn number theory, the crank of a partition is a certain integer associated with the partition. Dyson first introduced the term without a definition in a 1944 paper in a journal published by the Mathematics Society of Cambridge University. He then gave a list of properties this yet-to-be-defined quantity should have. In 1988, George E. Andrews and Frank Garvan discovered a definition for the crank satisfying the properties Dyson had hypothesized.\nAstrochicken.\nAstrochicken is the name given to a thought experiment Dyson expounded in his book \"Disturbing the Universe\" (1979). He contemplated how humanity could build a small, self-replicating automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a crewed craft could. He attributed the general idea to John von Neumann, based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled \"The General and Logical Theory of Automata\". Dyson expanded on von Neumann's automata theories and added a biological component.\nLumpers and splitters.\nDyson suggested that philosophers can be broadly if simplistically, divided into lumpers and splitters. These roughly correspond to Platonists, who regard the world as made up of ideas, and materialists, who imagine it divided into atoms.\nViews.\nClimate change.\nDyson agreed that technically humans and additional CO emissions contribute to warming. However, he felt that the benefits of additional CO outweighed any associated negative effects. He said that in many ways increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is beneficial, and that it is increasing biological growth, agricultural yields and forests. He believed that existing simulation models of climate change fail to account for some important factors, and that the results thus contain too great a margin of error to reliably predict trends. He argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority, and viewed the acceptance of climate change as comparable to religion.\nIn 2009, Dyson criticised James Hansen's climate-change activism. \"The person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is Jim Hansen. He consistently exaggerates all the dangers... Hansen has turned his science into ideology.\" Hansen responded that Dyson \"doesn't know what he's talking about... If he's going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet, then he should first do his homework- which he obviously has not done on global warming\". Dyson replied that \"[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it's rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have.\" Dyson stated in an interview that the argument with Hansen was exaggerated by \"The New York Times\", stating that he and Hansen are \"friends, but we don't agree on everything.\"\nSince originally taking an interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson suggested that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculated that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere. In a 2014 interview he said, \"What I'm convinced of is that we don't understand climate\u2026 It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled.\"\nDyson was a member of the academic advisory council of the Global Warming Policy Foundation.\nWarfare and weapons.\nAt RAF Bomber Command, Dyson and colleagues proposed removing two gun turrets from Avro Lancaster bombers, to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the Battle of Berlin. A Lancaster without turrets could fly faster and be much more manoeuvrable.\nOn hearing the news of the bombing of Hiroshima:\nIn 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser, Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War. When a general said in a meeting, \"I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing\u2026\" Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write a report on the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, \"Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia\", published by the Institute for Defense Analyses, was obtained, with some redactions, by the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability under the Freedom of Information act in 2002.) It was sufficiently objective that both sides of the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons.\nDyson opposed the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the invasion of Iraq. He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 US presidential election and \"The New York Times\" described him as a political liberal. He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote Obama a strongly supportive letter about his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.\nScience and religion.\nDyson was raised in what he described as a \"watered-down Church of England Christianity\". He was a nondenominational Christian and attended various churches, from Presbyterian to Roman Catholic. Regarding doctrinal or Christological issues, he said, \"I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology.\"\nDyson partially disagreed with the remark by his fellow physicist Steven Weinberg that \"With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil \u2013 that takes religion.\"\nDyson identified himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith. For example, in reviewing \"The God of Hope and the End of the World\" by John Polkinghorne, Dyson wrote:\nIn \"The God Delusion\" (2006), evolutionary biologist and atheist activist Richard Dawkins singled out Dyson for accepting the Templeton Prize in 2000: \"It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists.\" In 2000, Dyson declared that he was a (non-denominational) Christian, and he disagreed with Dawkins on several subjects, such as that group selection is less important than individual selection on the subject of evolution."}
{"id": "11399", "revid": "1271307881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11399", "title": "Fourth Council of the Lateran", "text": "The Fourth Council of the Lateran or Lateran IV was convoked by Pope Innocent III in April 1213 and opened at the Lateran Palace in Rome on 11 November 1215. Due to the great length of time between the council's convocation and its meeting, many bishops had the opportunity to attend this council, which is considered by the Catholic Church to be the twelfth ecumenical council. \nThe council addressed a number of issues, including the sacraments, the role of the laity, the treatment of Jews and heretics, and the organization of the church. The decree mandating annual confession has been called \"pehaps the most important legislative act in the history of the church.\"\nIn the case of Jews and Muslims, this included compelling them to wear distinctive badges to prevent social contact \"through error\". The council is viewed by medievalists as both opening up many reforms, and as formalising and enforcing intolerance in European society, both to heretics and Jews, and thus playing a role in the development of systemic European antisemitism.\nBackground.\nInnocent III first mooted organizing an ecumenical council in November 1199. In his letter titled \"Vineam Domini\", dated 19 April 1213, the Pope writes of the urgent need to recover the Holy Land and reform the Church. The letter, which also served as a summons to an ecumenical council, was included alongside the Pope's papal bull \"Quia maior\". In preparing for the council, the Pope spearheaded the extensive refurbishment of the old St. Peter's Basilica, which he designated as the \"centrepiece for display and decoration\" during the council. The lunette of the main door leading to the tomb of St. Peter had engravings of Old Testament prophets and twenty-four bishops, alongside the messages, \"Feed your Sheep\" and \"This is the Door of the Sheep\".\nThe measures against the Jews were the culmination of hostility during Innocent's reign as Pope, itself informed by a background of greater hostility to the Jews generated in part by the Crusades. Innocent for example waged a novel campaign against the Talmud as part of the campaign against heresy, claiming that the Talmud was an invention of the Rabbis, and the Jews should be restricted to using Biblical texts for their faith. This was the first time that the Catholic church had tried to directly regulate the practice of Judaism.\nProceedings.\nInnocent III deliberately chose for the Fourth Council to meet in November, during which there were numerous feast days. A preliminary legal session took place on 4 November, while the opening ceremony of the council was held on St. Martin's Day and began with a private morning Mass. Afterwards, at the start of the first plenary session in the Lateran Palace, the Pope led the singing of \"Veni Creator Spiritus\" and preached about Jesus' words to his disciples at the Last Supper, quoting from Luke 22. In his next two sermons, one on the need to recover the Holy Land and the other on dealing with heretics, the Pope was joined on stage by Raoul of M\u00e9rencourt and Thedisius of Agde respectively.\nOn 14 November, there were violent scenes between the partisans of Simon de Montfort among the French bishops and those of the Count of Toulouse. Raymond VI of Toulouse, his son (afterwards Raymond VII), and Raymond-Roger of Foix attended the council to dispute the threatened confiscation of their territories; Bishop Foulques and Guy de Montfort (brother of Simon de Montfort) argued in favour of the confiscation. All of Raymond VI's lands were confiscated, save Provence, which was kept in trust to be restored to Raymond VII. Pierre-Bermond of Sauve's claim to Toulouse was rejected and Toulouse was awarded to de Montfort, while the lordship of Melgueil was separated from Toulouse and entrusted to the bishops of Maguelonne.\nThe next day, in a ceremony attended by many council participants, the Pope consecrated the Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere, which had been rebuilt by Callixtus II. Four days later, the anniversary celebration at St. Peter's Basilica brought together such a large gathering that the Pope himself had trouble entering the premises.\nThe second plenary session was held on 20 November; the Pope was scheduled to preach about church reform, but proceedings were disrupted by bishops who opposed the designation of Frederick II as Holy Roman Emperor. The council concluded on 30 November, Saint Andrew's Day, during which the Pope preached on the Nicene Creed and concluded his remarks by raising up a relic of the True Cross. The archbishop of Mainz attempted to interrupt the speech, although he complied with the Pope's raising of his handa command to stay silent.\nOutcomes.\nLateran IV had three objectives: crusading, Church reform, and combating heresy. The seventy-one Lateran canons, which were not debated, were only formally adopted on the last day of the council; according to Anne J. Duggan, the \"scholarly consensus\" is that they were drafted by Innocent III himself. They cover a range of themes including Church reform and elections, taxation, matrimony, tithing, simony, and Judaism. After being recorded in the papal registers, the canons were quickly circulated in law schools. Effective application of the decrees varied according to local conditions and customs.\nJoachimism.\nThe Council condemned the teaching of the Joachimites, which was a mystical tendency of Franciscans who believed the church was entering a new \"era of the Holy Spirit\" where the established church would be replaced by (or process into) an egalitarian and utopian monastic rule. \nAs part of this, the Council stated that \"between creator and creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them,\" which became the basis of much Catholic theology, notable of the \"analogia entis.\"\nMinorities.\nWhile the precise application and levels of conformity to Lateran IV were variable, some historians claim that it created a wide range of legal measures with long term repercussions, which were used to persecute minorities and helped usher in a specifically intolerant kind of European society, or as historian R. I. Moore defines it, a \"persecuting society\". These measures applied with vigour first to heretics, and then increasingly to other minorities, such as Jews and lepers. In the case of Jews, antisemitism had been rising since the Crusades in different parts of Europe, and the measures of Lateran IV gave the legal means to implement active systemic persecution, such as physical separation of Jews and Christians, enforced through Jews being obliged to wear distinctive badges or clothing.\nThe Council mandated that Jews separate and distinguish themselves, in order to \"protect\" Christians from their influence.\nRecords and implementation.\nWhile the proceedings were not officially recorded, unlike in previous councils, evidence of the events have been found in various manuscripts by observers of the council. The \"Chronica Majora\" by Matthew Paris contains a line drawing of one of the sessions at the council which his abbot William of St Albans had personally attended. An extensive eyewitness account by an anonymous German cleric was copied into a manuscript that was published in 1964, in commemoration of the Second Vatican Council, and is now housed at the University of Giessen.\nDissemination of the Canons themselves was often patchy and incomplete, as it relied on handwritten records kept by local bishops, while it is unclear if the Papacy ever provided official copies. Local adaptations of the Canons could reflect disagreements or differences of priorities, and the incompleteness of the transmission of the canons was recognised as a significant problem by the Papacy. Implementation of the council's reforms was included within the Canons, with instructions that local councils should be held in order to create plans for their adoption. Provinces held councils to instruct Bishops to hold local synods, however the evidence suggests that this mechanism did not result in Bishops holding meetings and organising reforms in the manner intended.\nLegacy.\nHenry of Segusio likened the council to the \"four great councils of antiquity\". Lateran IV is sometimes referred to as the \"Great Council of the Lateran\" due to the presence of 404 or 412 bishops (including 71 cardinals and archbishops) and over 800 abbots and priors representing some eighty ecclesiastical provinces, together with 23 Latin-speaking prelates from the Eastern Orthodox Church and representatives of several monarchs, including Frederick II, Otto IV, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, John, King of England, Andrew II of Hungary, Philip II of France, and the kings of Aragon, Cyprus, and Jerusalem. This made it the largest ecumenical council between the Council of Chalcedon and the Second Vatican Council; Anne J. Duggan writes that \"it was the largest, most representative, and most influential council assembled under papal leadership before the end of the fourteenth century.\" According to F. Donald Logan, \"the Fourth Lateran Council was the most important general council of the church in the Middle Ages\", whose effects \"were felt for centuries.\""}
